1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,900
"Dear Mr. Conan Edogawa"

2
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,290
An eerie atmosphere, the mysterious twosome.

3
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,290
An enveloping attack that closes in on Conan and Haibara.

4
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,890
They seek not to protect their own lives if for the sake of others.

5
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,990
A breathtaking 2 hours and a half is about to begin.

6
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,490
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,590
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,790
"The Confrontation with the Black Organization"

10
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,190
"The Coincidence of the Two Enemies on a Night with a Full Moon"

11
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,790
An Off-season Halloween party?

12
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,590
Just what month do they think it is?

13
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,190
Isn't Halloween on October 31st?

14
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,190
That's why it's written "off-season", isn't it?

15
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,290
What's written on the invitation card?

16
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,990
On the letter it says,

17
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,590
"Incapable Detective, Kogoro Mouri."

18
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,790
"On the night the full moon cometh,"

19
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,390
"I shall invite thee to this hideous night banquet."

20
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,990
"To the blood smeared party on the ship."

21
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,090
"Be it known that whether thou attend or not,"

22
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,290
"the pitiful lamb that goes passing shall curse its own fate,"

23
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,590
"and the sinner shall be ecstatic over the agonies of death."

24
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,390
So this is a letter challenging

25
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,890
the Famous Detective Kogoro Mouri!

26
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,390
Who on earth would've sent this invitation card to me?

27
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,290
Maybe a foreigner,

28
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,290
because the name of the sender is in english.

29
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,790
V. E. R. M. O. U. T. H.

30
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,490
Vermouth?

31
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,610
Vermouth?

32
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,610
I'm sorry, Ran.

33
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,510
But I've never heard that name before.

34
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,810
I see.

35
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,110
I wonder who sent us this invitation card?

36
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,410
Besides...

37
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,210
Isn't Kogoro going to the evening party?

38
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,510
It's tomorrow, isn't it?

39
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,810
Yes.

40
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,810
He says that brave Tokyo people should take on challenges.

41
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,010
Father's making preparations for it

42
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,110
and having Sonoko put on all kinds of makeup on him,

43
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,010
although he's still undecided which makeup he wants to go with.

44
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,010
-Makeup? -Yes.

45
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,610
It says on the invitation card that

46
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,110
since it's a Halloween party,

47
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,010
all participants must disguise themselves as monsters

48
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,810
and come dressed in formal black suits and dresses.

49
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,410
Of course anyone who comes as a companion must do likewise.

50
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,710
What? Companion?

51
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,910
You mean, you're going with him too?

52
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,010
Of course I'm not going to such a monster-filled party!

53
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,110
I guessed so.

54
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,310
And...

55
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,410
I have a favor to ask you, Dr. Agasa.

56
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,110
What is it?

57
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,110
If this invitation came to dad,

58
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,710
it could be that...

59
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,910
he got one too?

60
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,010
Oh, yeah. You mean Shinichi too?

61
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,610
Yes. So could you check the mailbox?

62
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,710
Unless you tell him about mail like these,

63
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,010
I'm sure he'll complain later.

64
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,710
Oh, okay.

65
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,910
If it's here, I'll call you back.

66
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,510
Well, I don't think he got one, though.

67
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,410
Oh, and please keep this a secret from Conan.

68
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,310
Because every time he goes to places like these,

69
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,510
he tends to stick his nose into dangerous things.

70
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,010
Besides...

71
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,010
Besides, what?

72
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,310
Oh, nothing.

73
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,210
And tell him that school will start soon

74
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,210
so to make sure to comes home

75
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,410
and that he shouldn't go here and there till then.

76
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,710
Yeah, okay.

77
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,110
I'll give him your message.

78
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,210
Bye.

79
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,310
Yeah.

80
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,810
How about this?

81
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,710
This is a masterpiece produced by Sonoko Suzuki!

82
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,110
I have this feeling that

83
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,010
I don't look much different from how I usually look.

84
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,410
What're you talking about?

85
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,210
You don't want it to look too drastic, do you?

86
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,010
If I cover you with heavy makeup and goofed,

87
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,210
there'd be no way out!

88
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,410
Well, that's true, but...

89
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,610
Isn't it fantastic?

90
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,410
You look really good, dad!

91
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,310
That amount of makeup is just enough

92
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,610
to bring out the good looks in you, Dad!

93
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,010
Do you think so?

94
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,410
What about you?

95
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,610
What kind of makeup did you decide to go as, Sonoko?

96
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,110
About that... Of course!

97
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm going to go in a super cute mini skirt

98
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,410
and knock the monsters out!

99
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,610
Knock the monsters out, my gosh.

100
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,110
Who knows? Maybe there'll be super good-looking monsters?

101
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,010
No way, no chance.

102
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,410
So what?

103
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,910
I'll bet you're after some super whopper body vampire

104
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,810
or something too. Won't you, Pops?

105
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,910
And?

106
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,010
Are you planning to board the phantom ship too?

107
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,110
Yeah.

108
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,710
The sender's name kind of bothers me so...

109
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,510
Do you have an idea of who the sender is or something?

110
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,510
No.

111
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,110
Shouldn't you're the one who has an idea, Haibara?

112
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,810
Because Vermouth, like Gin and Vodka,

113
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,910
are names of liquor.

114
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,010
Beats me.

115
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,010
Never heard of it.

116
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,710
Besides, I don't know much about liquor.

117
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,510
It's liquor from Italy.

118
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,710
Vermouth is the English spelling.

119
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,410
In Japan it's called...

120
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,810
"Bermutto".

121
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,610
Just as I thought.

122
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,610
It's written on your face that the name sounds familiar.

123
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,310
I guess it's the code name of one of The Black Organization members.

124
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,510
Then you mean that invitation card is from?

125
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,110
Yeah.

126
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,510
An invitation from Vermouth who is one of them.

127
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,610
I don't know if they're ready to take us on

128
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,310
or if they just got tired of waiting

129
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,210
but I can't pass up this opportunity.

130
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,210
Don't go.

131
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,910
Don't go! Stop, I tell you!

132
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,210
It's a trap and if you go you'll be killed...

133
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,610
Yeah. It could be...

134
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,910
Then...

135
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,810
Then, why?

136
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,510
Hey, Shinichi.

137
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,310
You didn't have to do that.

138
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,810
Sorry, Haibara.

139
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,910
With things as they are,

140
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,410
I'm stuck and can't move on.

141
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,110
But,

142
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,110
I wonder if it's okay for you to leave Ai here like this

143
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,610
and leave just like that.

144
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,310
Look at the address, Dr. Agasa.

145
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,910
On the envelope that was delivered to my house,

146
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,810
and the invitation card in it,

147
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,110
both were addressed to the name Shinichi Kudo.

148
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,010
But the name on the letter that came with it is addressed to...

149
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,910
Dear Mr. Conan Edogawa?

150
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,210
Hey, Shinichi! This...

151
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,710
Yeah. Everything's out in the open.

152
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,110
My true identity,

153
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,510
the fact that my body shrunk because of Apoptoxin 4869,

154
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,810
as well as the fact that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

155
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,410
And they most probably

156
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,410
know that Haibara is the Sherry,

157
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,010
who used to be one of them.

158
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,610
But, isn't it strange?

159
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,710
If they have that much information already,

160
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,210
why aren't they here raiding us?

161
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,010
Beats me.

162
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,410
I don't know the reason

163
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,710
but I have a hunch

164
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,610
about one of the causes.

165
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,310
Hey. Don't tell me that you caught Ai's cold.

166
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,810
I'm fine.

167
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,710
What is that?

168
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,210
The telephone?

169
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,410
Mail?

170
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,810
Okay.

171
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,310
The only problem left is...

172
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,610
A Halloween Party?

173
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,810
Yeah.

174
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,810
It's going to start tomorrow night at 19:00.

175
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,510
But, Gin,

176
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,910
why do I have to go to a crazy place like that?

177
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,410
Vermouth is in this.

178
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,510
We've got orders to go check out the internal affairs.

179
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,010
I was just about getting fed up

180
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,110
with that lady's secretiveness too.

181
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,510
I didn't get the go-sign, but who cares.

182
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,910
If she acts up,

183
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,910
I'll show no mercy.

184
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,810
Even if she's that person's favourite...

185
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,310
Strange.

186
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,310
It's strange after all.

187
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,310
Compared to when I came here to check the mailbox,

188
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,810
the water meter as well as the gas meter has moved,

189
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,810
although it's really slight.

190
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,910
Who is inside

191
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,010
this house?

192
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,310
I guess this is the best place to watch me and Haibara.

193
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,110
I know I can handle two men,

194
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,510
but what if there are more than three?

195
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,510
Cool head.

196
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,110
Judging from the meter,

197
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,310
the most that would be in here is one or two of them.

198
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,810
Besides...

199
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,870
What a full moon.

200
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,970
Really, it's so appropriate for "A Blood-smeared Party on Board"!

201
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,970
All right.

202
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,170
I'm getting excited!

203
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm feeling a positive turbulent rush of blood.

204
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,470
Hey, Pops.

205
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,970
Isn't the werewolf the one who feels a positive

206
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,470
turbulent rush of blood when the full moon is out?

207
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,270
You're Dracula, you know, Pops.

208
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,570
Shut up.

209
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,070
I mean I'm getting a positive turbulent rush of blood as a detective!

210
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,170
Excuse me?

211
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,270
Are you two also going to be attending

212
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,070
the Off-season Halloween Party too?

213
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,770
Right.

214
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,170
I thought it was ridiculous

215
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,670
because it's a costume party, but...

216
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,370
Well, the thing is...

217
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,570
I'm going there too!

218
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,570
I wonder if it's going to be okay

219
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,570
leaving Ai like that by herself.

220
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,370
Yeah.

221
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,670
I left the room warm.

222
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,570
I also left food and water behind with her too,

223
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,970
so I don't think there'll be any problems.

224
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,670
I can't wait to play

225
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,370
that new game you were saying you created.

226
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,270
Do you want to try it?

227
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,870
The position of the things in the drawer

228
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,570
is also slightly out of place.

229
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,870
You looked for it

230
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,970
all by yourself

231
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,170
in order to confront them.

232
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,370
Look at them!

233
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,870
Werewolf.

234
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,070
Frankenstein.

235
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,770
Mummy.

236
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,170
Even Jiangshi is here!

237
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,470
It's full of monsters!

238
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,670
Really! How exciting!

239
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,170
Are you sure it's okay

240
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,170
for the daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group

241
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,670
to be mixed up among guys like this?

242
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,370
It's fine...

243
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,670
Unlike Ran, I kind of like stuff like this!

244
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,370
By the way, Sonoko?

245
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,970
Just what are you disguised as?

246
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,270
How rude!

247
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,170
I'm a witch!

248
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,470
Don't you see that I've got a broom?

249
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,170
What's with him?

250
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,070
Hey, Pops?

251
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,570
Maybe he's saying move over

252
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,570
because the front seats are open?

253
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,170
Darn it.

254
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,470
Then why don't you say so in a way I understand.

255
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,670
He's just really trying to be the character

256
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,170
that he's disguised as.

257
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,370
My... What a beautiful witch you are.

258
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,170
Thank you.

259
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,470
But, I'm...

260
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,270
not a witch.

261
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,470
Medusa?

262
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,770
I'll turn you into stone.

263
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,470
Will the next person show us your invitation card!

264
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,870
Sure...

265
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,670
You're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

266
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,970
So, you saw through my disguise?

267
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,770
Oh, no.

268
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,670
Your name's written on the invitation card, see?

269
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,670
Then, please fill in your name.

270
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,870
Yeah.

271
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,770
Kogoro. Mouri.

272
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,470
By the way...

273
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,670
I hope you're not planning to really commit a murder here, are you?

274
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,270
Well, together with this invitation card,

275
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,570
there was a letter hinting that a crime may be committed here!

276
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,470
It's true that this invitation card is what we made,

277
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,670
but I know nothing of this letter or the envelope.

278
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,370
Really?

279
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,470
There will be a "guess who the criminal is" game

280
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,770
played during the party though.

281
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,170
Could it be

282
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,170
the producer decided to do a little extra

283
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,570
to make sure he'll come here.

284
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,370
Producer?

285
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,270
Oh, no, it's nothing.

286
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,070
But, we're sure that you'll enjoy the cursed banquet.

287
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,370
Come on, Pops!

288
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,570
Let's hurry and go!

289
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,570
Oh, Hey, you!

290
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,970
Next guest please!

291
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,770
Your invitation card, please.

292
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,070
Aren't you by chance

293
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,870
the high school detective?

294
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,370
"Shinichi Kudo"

295
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,430
Thank you.

296
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,630
But, they sure got a lot of them gathered here.

297
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,830
You can say that again.

298
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,930
What?

299
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,330
It's finally going to start.

300
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,430
Yeah.

301
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,230
You devilish diabolic monsters

302
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,330
who wander through the nether world,

303
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,130
welcome to our haunted ship named Phantom.

304
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,830
I am Captain Gold and I will be navigating this phantom ship.

305
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,630
There's only an hour more to go before the party.

306
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,730
Please pick your comrades who will be sharing fate with you.

307
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,030
Seven comrades who have received the same seal as yourself.

308
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,530
The same seal?

309
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,030
The tarot card!

310
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,730
You got one when you came on board too, didn't you?

311
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,030
I think we're going to team up with people who got the same card

312
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,530
and play a game or something.

313
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,430
You mean this XV that's written here,

314
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,730
the card of the goat.

315
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,930
Which means we're on the goat team?

316
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,730
That's not a goat.

317
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,230
In Roman Numerals XV is the figure 15.

318
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,830
The name of the card is The Devil.

319
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,630
The card of the devil.

320
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,530
Oh, is that right?

321
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,730
Besides, we weren't divided in groups

322
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,730
just to play a game.

323
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,630
This party is also an audition for a role in a movie too.

324
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,230
An audition?

325
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,630
You know, don't you?

326
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,030
The movie that's played every summer called

327
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,330
"The Diary of Captain Ghost's Voyage".

328
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,730
Yeah.

329
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,130
The one about a load of monsters riding a phantom ship

330
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,830
and coming to get people who performed evil deeds.

331
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,030
Which means if things work out,

332
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,230
I may appear in the movie too?

333
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,530
Yes.

334
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,030
This seems to be the fourth time this party's been held,

335
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,230
and each year the movie staff

336
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,330
seem to be mixed among everyone here

337
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,630
to judge carefully for the cast.

338
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,030
I see.

339
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,930
Everyone wants to play the part of popular monster roles,

340
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,230
so they divide people into teams to make choosing easier.

341
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,530
That's why everyone's

342
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,330
trying to put out their best, right?

343
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,730
The Werewolf who roars towards the moon.

344
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,830
The Frankenstein that moves like a robot

345
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,130
and does pantomime.

346
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,930
The Mummy who keeps his silence no matter who talks to him.

347
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,230
Well, although they're going to appear in the movie,

348
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,330
they're no more than supporting actors

349
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,230
who will appear behind the main stars.

350
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,630
Since it'll cost an enormous amount of money

351
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,930
if the film company has to cover makeup fees

352
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,330
and everything for all the supporting actors,

353
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,330
so they let horror fans appear in their best outfits

354
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,230
and put on their best act.

355
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,130
Besides, holding an event on the this ship that was used in the movie

356
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,330
will serve as an advertisement for the movie too.

357
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,830
All right, all of you!

358
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,930
The time to set sail has come!

359
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,030
We shall cross the seven cursed seas

360
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,730
and show the conceited humans our power

361
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,230
as well as teach them a lesson!

362
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,530
Don't tell me this ship is...

363
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,830
really going to move?

364
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,230
Is there anyone who has the card of Death?

365
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,630
Hermit!

366
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,430
Anybody around who has the card of the Hermit?

367
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,730
What? Shinichi Kudo?

368
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,430
You mean that high school detective is on this ship?

369
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,930
Right...

370
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,930
But I heard that he was involved in some kind of incident

371
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,730
and was killed.

372
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,030
No way! That's nothing but lies!

373
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,830
And? What kind of disguise was he in?

374
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,330
He was bandaged up,

375
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,630
so maybe a mummy?

376
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,730
A mummy detective.

377
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,730
That would be so handsome!

378
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,130
Okay!

379
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,930
All seven of us are here!

380
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,730
They're the people we saw just a while ago.

381
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,030
Now our names...

382
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,630
This is Medusa.

383
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,630
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy.

384
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,130
And can we call you Mummy 2?

385
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,930
What? Do you want to shake hands?

386
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,630
I see.

387
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,030
You're Invisible Man.

388
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,530
So...

389
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,730
I wonder what the seven of us are going to do?

390
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,930
They did say that this was a catch the culprit sort of game.

391
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,830
How do you like the game I made this time?

392
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,230
It's pretty cool, don't you think?

393
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,430
Yeah. It's a masterpiece!

394
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,130
Right!

395
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,030
-I'm sure this'll satisfy them. -Yes, Agasa residence.

396
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,430
-I'll call them first thing tomorrow. -I'm sorry for calling this late.

397
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,730
This is Dr. Araide.

398
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,330
-Is Dr. Agasa there? -I'll have them monitor it!

399
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,830
He's not in.

400
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,830
I think he went out somewhere with Edogawa.

401
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,030
What? But I hear their voices.

402
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,630
This?

403
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,030
It's their recorded voices.

404
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,230
I don't know what prank they're up to.

405
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,630
But it's been playing for some time now.

406
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,630
So, what's up?

407
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,430
Oh, yeah.

408
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,230
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

409
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,530
Well, your cold's taking a while to get better, right?

410
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,230
So I figured you should be checked at a hospital with good facilities,

411
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,730
and asked a friend doctor of mine,

412
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,430
but was told that he has to go on a business trip,

413
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,030
so he's only available tonight.

414
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,430
That is why...

415
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,330
I know this is really sudden

416
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,730
but can I go pick you up now?

417
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,030
I'll notify Dr. Agasa later for you.

418
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,930
Well, I don't want to force you though.

419
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,630
It doesn't bother me.

420
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,730
I was kind of angry anyway because they're doing their own thing.

421
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,530
Besides, it's boring staying home alone.

422
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,230
Great.

423
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,330
Then, okay.

424
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,730
I'll be there in about an hour

425
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,030
so will you get ready to leave as soon as I get there?

426
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,130
Okay.

427
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,730
I'll see you in an hour then.

428
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,030
All right! All seven of us have finally gathered!

429
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,630
What dense guys.

430
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,430
Pops?

431
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:55,330
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy are nowhere in sight.

432
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,530
What?

433
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,030
I wonder if they went to the toilet.

434
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,830
I guess so?

435
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,230
If that is the case, let's go see.

436
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,530
The party is about to begin too.

437
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,630
Yeah.

438
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,230
It's over here.

439
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,930
Oh, there he is!

440
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,130
I tell you, Frankenstein!

441
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,630
We looked all over for you!

442
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,130
What a toilet this is, though.

443
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,330
It's dimly lit and full of spider webs,

444
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,230
even the mirror is cracked.

445
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,830
Not only that, men and women have to use the toilet together!

446
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,430
After all, we're all monsters,

447
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,830
so I guess there's no need to differentiate between men and women.

448
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,830
It won't come off.

449
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,430
The blood on my hands won't come off.

450
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,130
It won't come off even if I wash my hands.

451
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,030
Hey, acting your part even in the toilet too?

452
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,530
Excuse me.

453
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,630
Are Werewolf and Mummy here?

454
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,230
They don't seem to be here.

455
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,330
Yeah.

456
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,830
What was that?

457
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,230
Hey, boss! What's up?

458
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,430
Bartender.

459
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,230
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

460
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,530
Silver Bullet?

461
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,430
White Lady for me then, please.

462
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,030
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,830
Hey, you don't look too hot.

464
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,330
Are you bummed out or something?

465
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,530
Hey.

466
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,630
What is it?

467
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,830
Is he looking for somebody?

468
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,030
I wonder where Mummy disappeared to?

469
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,730
How should I know? Geez...

470
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,030
Of all things! Talk about not being able to work in groups.

471
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,630
An hour has already gone by.

472
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,230
-What? -What's...

473
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,330
The party has started.

474
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,930
Listen, you monsters.

475
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,330
I've got good news for all of you.

476
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,230
The bait's been set.

477
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,930
It seems that there is a human

478
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,330
among us at this party

479
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,730
that is neither ugly nor possesses evil power.

480
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,230
Go now and join hands with the seven comrades

481
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,630
that you will share your fate with.

482
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,830
Find the good-for-nothing, tear its meat apart,

483
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,630
pull out its guts

484
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,730
and drink up to the last drop the blood

485
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,130
that comes flowing out!

486
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,330
Okay!

487
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,330
If it's looking for the culprit, there's none other than I,

488
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,630
Kogoro Mouri, more suited for the job!

489
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,930
But, not all seven of us are here yet.

490
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,530
Who cares!

491
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,530
If I figure out who the culprit is,

492
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,130
I'm sure they'll come walking out from their side!

493
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,530
I have the keyword which is the hint to who it is.

494
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,730
If you want to get hold of the treasure

495
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,330
that is to be your reward,

496
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,430
come out to deck and receive my revelation...

497
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,730
What's that?

498
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,930
What's the matter?

499
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:52,730
I'm sorry, the load that was on the construction truck fell off.

500
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,730
We'll clear it up right away,

501
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,930
so please give us a moment.

502
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,630
I'm in a bit of a rush,

503
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,930
so I'm going to go around.

504
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,430
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,330
I'm sorry.

506
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,330
Thank you for waiting.

507
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,030
You may go through now.

508
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,130
Thank you. Goodbye.

509
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,430
Take care!

510
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,430
He just went through.

511
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,630
What's that?

512
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,130
That's...

513
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,530
Captain of the phantom ship?

514
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,030
What a grand performance.

515
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,430
This is real blood.

516
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,430
What?

517
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,530
Hurry!

518
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,630
Hurry, somebody get him down!

519
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,430
Yes...

520
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,730
Hi.

521
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,820
Hi.

522
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,720
Oh, I'm sorry to have surprised you.

523
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,520
I'm an English teacher of Teitan High School,

524
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,420
where Dr. Araide is in charge of.

525
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,720
His car broke down on his way here.

526
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,620
That's why I've come to pick you up instead!

527
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,820
If it's okay with you, will you please unchain the door?

528
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,120
I'm really late.

529
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Jodie.

530
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,220
His chest is pierced through with an arrow of a bow gun.

531
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,420
Moreover,

532
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,520
the card of the devil is here too.

533
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,720
So, the devil's the guide to the world beyond?

534
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,520
I don't think he needed any guide to take him

535
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,520
to the world beyond though,

536
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,820
because he seemed to have died on the spot.

537
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,320
True.

538
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,820
And as for the bow gun that fired the arrow,

539
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,420
it's probably been disposed of somewhere in this vast Pacific Ocean

540
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,020
so virtually will not be found.

541
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,920
So, I wonder if there's a camera on this ship?

542
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,120
I'd like to take a picture of the scene.

543
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,620
We have a digital camera

544
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,720
that we are using to take pictures of this party.

545
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,220
Well, it's something that will serve as evidence

546
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,220
so I'd prefer something on film, but...

547
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,320
Pops,

548
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,420
I've got a disposable camera on me.

549
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,120
See.

550
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,620
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

551
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,020
I'll take a look at his face then.

552
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,520
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

553
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,120
Isn't he a movie producer that appears a lot on TV?

554
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,920
I think his name was Senzo Fukuura.

555
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,320
I think he became famous

556
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,620
after producing the Unlucky Days series,

557
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,820
before the Phantom Ship Captain series.

558
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,920
Are you saying that the producer appeared in the movie in person

559
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,520
and acted the role of the captain of Phantom Ship?

560
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,220
No, the movie was filmed using a real actor.

561
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,620
Mr. Fukuura loved the captain of the Phantom Ship,

562
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,120
so he used to play the role of his own initiative every year

563
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,920
at the party on board.

564
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,820
Mr. Fukuura is the one who planned the performance of

565
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,420
appearing on the mast with the light shining on him

566
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,620
and giving out hints to the quiz.

567
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,920
Yeah.

568
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,020
You mean that quiz about humans being mixed up here among the monsters.

569
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,820
There's a microphone attached to the inside of the mask.

570
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,320
It seems he was talking directly into this microphone.

571
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,020
And?

572
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,420
What's the answer to this quiz?

573
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,020
Well, the quizzes and hints

574
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,820
were decide on by Mr. Fukuura alone,

575
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,020
so we, the staff know nothing about them.

576
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,320
We heard that the first group to solve the quiz

577
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,020
would receive an invitation to the preview of the movie, though.

578
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,620
Well,

579
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,620
it seems quite definite that one of you among the staff is the killer.

580
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,520
First of all,

581
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,220
Mr. Fukuura who was disguised as the captain of the phantom ship

582
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,520
started suffering while he was announcing the quiz.

583
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,020
He was probably struck by the bow gun then.

584
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,720
However, back then,

585
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,420
we, the passengers,

586
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,720
were still inside the ship at the party hall.

587
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,820
It would've been impossible for us

588
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,420
to fire the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

589
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,020
who was on the top of the mast.

590
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,820
So high chances the person who killed him

591
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,720
is the one who prepared the lighting

592
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,320
and audio devices when he announce the quiz,

593
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,820
which is one of the staff.

594
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,320
Secondly, this card of the devil.

595
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
The killer probably wanted to mislead people into thinking

596
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,020
that one of the passengers who boarded this ship

597
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,320
that received this card is the killer.

598
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,120
Since you're the ones who prepared the cards,

599
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,420
you probably could make as many of these cards as you wanted to.

600
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,520
No.

601
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,920
These cards were made by Mr. Fukuura to avoid foul play.

602
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,020
So, it would have been impossible for any of the staff

603
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,420
to prepare these cards.

604
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,920
Last year he used playing cards.

605
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,720
Besides there was a passenger who was on deck

606
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
before the quiz was announced too.

607
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,920
Saying that he wanted to look at the ocean.

608
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
I don't remember who exactly that person was

609
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,320
since it was dark though.

610
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,520
Oh, is that right?

611
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,720
I see.

612
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,220
Which means the possibility of the killer being among us

613
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,420
who has received the card of the devil is high!

614
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,520
Are you okay?

615
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,220
The doctor that we're going to see is very efficient!

616
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,020
So, your cold will be cured right away

617
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,420
and you'll feel better in no time at all.

618
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,420
By the way,

619
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,520
when is this ship returning to the harbor?

620
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,420
I think it'll be another hour or so.

621
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,620
I see.

622
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,920
Then, shall we go inside the ship

623
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,120
and investigate the case?

624
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Mr. Sleeping Vampire?

625
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,620
Oh, okay.

626
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,920
What's up, Pops?

627
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,220
It seems we're going to be late

628
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,020
so I thought I'd let Ran know.

629
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,520
She's not answering.

630
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,820
Maybe she's taking a bath?

631
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,620
"Mouri Detective Agency"

632
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,270
Okay, then.

633
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,870
Please show me the card of the devil that you all have.

634
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,670
What?

635
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,870
What's the matter, Mummy?

636
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,470
I wonder if I dropped it somewhere?

637
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,170
You deliberately poked your card with the arrow

638
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,170
and tried to free yourself from being a suspect, right?

639
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,070
You played on the psychology that

640
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,070
nobody would think that the killer himself

641
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,770
would leave his devil card behind with the victim,

642
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,170
unaware that this card

643
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,970
was a one of a kind in this world,

644
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,170
that Mr. Fukuura had exclusively made!

645
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,470
I was fully aware of that too!

646
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,870
How'd you know?

647
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,270
Because...

648
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,370
I was asked by Mr. Fukuura

649
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,370
to sit among the passengers

650
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,770
and choose someone with great makeup on.

651
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,770
After all, I'm also a staff member of the movie!

652
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,770
What?

653
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,370
You're a movie staff member?

654
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,670
So I would never dream of hurting Mr. Fukuura.

655
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,970
Are you the only movie staff

656
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,570
that is mixed up among the passengers here?

657
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,970
No.

658
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,670
Almost all the other mummies besides me are staff members.

659
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,770
When we find passengers with great makeup,

660
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,770
we contacted Mr. Fukuura by e-mail.

661
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,870
Mr. Fukuura was also the one that gave us this outfit, right?

662
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,170
Yeah.

663
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,370
We received all kinds of instructions from Mr. Fukuura

664
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,870
while he was helping us with the makeup.

665
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,870
Instructions? What kind of instructions?

666
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,770
Like, drink a certain kind of wine, et cetera.

667
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,370
I was told to eat only chicken dishes.

668
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,270
I was told to wear this red wig.

669
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,270
All his instructions were varied depending on the person

670
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,370
and the only common instruction he gave us was not to talk.

671
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,170
What kind of instruction is that supposed to be?

672
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,670
How should I know?

673
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,070
It's Mr. Fukuura's instructions!

674
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,470
But...

675
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,170
when we were waiting for the quiz,

676
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,070
you disappeared from before us, didn't you?

677
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,070
I went to the toilet!

678
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,370
These two were with me too!

679
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,670
Right?

680
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,170
It's true.

681
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,170
That you were with us when we went to the toilet.

682
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,670
See!

683
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,170
But...

684
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,670
I didn't see you come out of the toilet.

685
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,370
What? What are you talking about?

686
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,170
I passed right behind you when I left!

687
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,070
Why're you saying something like that?

688
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,170
I guess you didn't notice me

689
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,170
because somebody cracked the mirror.

690
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,170
What? You mean that mirror

691
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,570
wasn't cracked to begin with in order to give a creepy atmosphere?

692
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,170
Yes.

693
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:28,470
It wasn't cracked until we departed!

694
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,370
Are you sure?

695
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,470
Yes!

696
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,870
We, the staff, decorated this ship together.

697
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,070
But we weren't given instructions

698
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,270
to crack the mirror in the toilet.

699
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,770
Then, just before Mr. Fukuura was about to give out the quiz,

700
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,070
where were you?

701
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,770
I was here!

702
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,670
Near Werewolf! Right?

703
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,870
You saw me, didn't you?

704
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,770
I wonder. I don't remember.

705
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,470
Oh, no.

706
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,670
I was desperate trying to sell myself

707
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,170
because I wanted a part in the movie!

708
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,570
Like this!

709
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,370
Come to think of it,

710
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,470
you were roaring several times.

711
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:23,170
It seems that nobody's seen you around.

712
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:27,070
Which means you don't have an established alibi.

713
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,370
Oh, no.

714
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,770
It... It's a trap!

715
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,870
Somebody's conspired to frame me!

716
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:39,470
A killer who's cornered barks a lot.

717
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:44,670
Moreover, you don't have an alibi and the devil card.

718
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,770
Mummy, you're the only one...

719
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,470
You're the only one that could've committed the murder!

720
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,970
Detective Mouri, you're a little off there.

721
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,670
What?

722
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,370
The truth is still in the dark.

723
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,670
The voice is coming from the speaker the phantom ship captain was using!

724
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,970
Darn it!

725
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,270
The deck!

726
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,970
Out of my way!

727
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,370
Who is it?

728
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,070
Where are you?

729
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,070
You've already acquired everything you need

730
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,870
to solve the case and yet...

731
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,170
How disappointing.

732
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,270
Why you!

733
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,370
Who are you?

734
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:41,670
You better shut up or you're going to pay for this!

735
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,370
Have you forgotten me already?

736
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,570
It's me, Detective Mouri.

737
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,270
Invisible man!

738
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,070
Captain of this phantom ship, Captain Gold, that is,

739
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,170
the host of this party

740
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,370
and movie producer, Mr. Senzo Fukuura,

741
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,070
was killed by who?

742
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,970
And...

743
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,570
how was he killed?

744
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,270
Shall we...

745
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,870
begin solving the case then?

746
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,870
That voice.

747
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,970
That tone of voice.

748
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,870
It can't be...

749
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,870
Under the moonlight...

750
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,870
that shines light upon the dark night.

751
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,900
You're...

752
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,400
The detective kid.

753
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,700
Shinichi Kudo?

754
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,800
What? No way!

755
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,000
What brings you here?

756
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,400
-Shinichi Kudo? -Shinichi Kudo?

757
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,700
Kudo? You mean that famous high school detective?

758
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,500
What?

759
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,000
So, he wasn't dead.

760
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,300
It can't be...

761
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,400
No way.

762
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,000
I got rid of that kid some time ago.

763
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,800
See. You have nothing to complain about now, do you?

764
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,200
Hurry and give me the film.

765
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
Gin.

766
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,500
Gin killed him with a poison drug.

767
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,700
What is going on?

768
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,500
Hey.

769
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Will you grant me

770
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,900
just one favor?

771
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,200
Detective kid, long time no see!

772
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,900
Sorry for saying this after you've made your grand appearance

773
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,700
but this case has already been solved!

774
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,000
The one who shot Mr. Fukuura

775
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,200
from the top of the mast that you're standing right now

776
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,300
when he was just about to give out the hint to the quiz,

777
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,400
is the one who sneaked out of the cabin, the party hall,

778
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,900
and came out to this dark deck

779
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,900
as well as the one who was able to place the card of the devil

780
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,400
on the arrow of the bow gun that was fired...

781
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,400
can be none other than

782
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,800
the one who has no alibi at that time

783
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,600
on top of not having the card of the devil on him,

784
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,700
Mummy, who's right here with me!

785
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,200
Where in my deduction am I off track?

786
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,700
Hey! Come on, say something!

787
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,900
Oh, excuse me.

788
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,500
I got a bit of a cold and my throat's...

789
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,200
A cold?

790
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,600
So...

791
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,000
You mentioned his alibi and his card, is that right?

792
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,400
The killer probably

793
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,000
pick-pocketed Mummy's card

794
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,100
in order to frame him as the killer.

795
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,700
The killer pick-pocketed?

796
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,000
If you insist that Mummy's not the killer

797
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,800
the only probable deduction is either he dropped it,

798
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,000
or somebody stole it from him!

799
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
After all, the card is specially made

800
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,400
so that there's only one card for each person!

801
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,600
Yes.

802
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,300
Whether the killer knew was aware of this or not,

803
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,500
he stole it from Mummy,

804
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,100
inside the toilet!

805
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,100
In the toilet?

806
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,300
Hey, is that right, Mummy?

807
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,000
Beats me.

808
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,700
He, himself says he doesn't know,

809
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,600
so that's out!

810
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,700
Well, it's not surprising that he doesn't remember.

811
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,300
The killer probably

812
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,200
went into the toilet compartment next to the one Mummy went inside

813
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,000
and injected an anesthetic or something with a syringe

814
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,600
from the space of the partition of the toilet.

815
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,900
After Mummy sucked the vapor in and passed out,

816
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,600
the killer probably snuck in from the top part of the partition

817
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,400
and pulled the card out,

818
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,800
taking it from Mummy.

819
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,000
Hey!

820
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,600
Where do you have such evidence!

821
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,200
I have no such evidence.

822
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,900
I just mentioned

823
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,900
the easiest way possible to carry out the murder.

824
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,800
Besides, I believe that the anesthetic and syringe

825
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,000
are already inside the sea.

826
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,800
Just what do you think you're talking about?

827
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,700
Don't tell me you're going to say you don't know who the killer is!

828
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,200
Right?

829
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,800
There is indeed only one person

830
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,100
who could be the killer though.

831
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,700
Detective Mouri.

832
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,100
What?

833
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,300
The one who killed Mr. Fukuura

834
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,900
as well as tried to put the blame on Mummy

835
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,600
is none other than

836
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,200
you!

837
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,500
Werewolf!

838
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
What?

839
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,800
Werewolf?

840
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,300
Your head must've dulled from your cold.

841
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,800
We all saw Werewolf come out of the toilet,

842
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,200
as well as just before Mr. Fukuura gave out the quiz!

843
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
While on the contrary,

844
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,800
Mummy wasn't seen by anybody!

845
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,400
Just what are you talking about?

846
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,000
When I came out of the toilet,

847
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,100
you were watching me!

848
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,500
What?

849
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,300
Are you doubting my memory?

850
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,400
I was here too,

851
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,000
when the quiz was just about to be announced,

852
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,800
right near you!

853
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,000
Hey,

854
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,600
don't tell me that you're going to say that

855
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,000
you weren't the Mummy but the Invisible Man?

856
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Frankenstein has the key that will unravel the mystery.

857
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,500
Why?

858
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,700
Won't you tell us why,

859
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,200
you were acting your role as a monster

860
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,900
even inside the toilet?

861
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,200
As well as what you were surprised at right afterwards.

862
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,300
It's a well-known thing among we horror fans that

863
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,800
if there is anyone within the party grounds that is sending e-mails,

864
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,000
that person is a movie staff that is judging to see

865
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,400
whether they should give us a chance to appear in the movie or not.

866
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,500
That's why I knew right off the bat that he was a staff member.

867
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,000
So, I followed him to sell myself,

868
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,100
and kept acting my role until he came out.

869
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,400
But the one who came out of the toilet that he went in was...

870
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,900
Werewolf?

871
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,800
What? You mean Mummy was Werewolf?

872
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Hey...

873
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,100
Then, don't tell me that...

874
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,200
That's right.

875
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,400
The killer not only wanted to put the blame on Mummy

876
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,200
who was asleep in the toilet,

877
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,500
he also put something else on Mummy

878
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,200
which is his own werewolf's mask!

879
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,300
He probably cracked the mirror in the toilet

880
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,900
to keep Mummy from finding out what happened.

881
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,700
He doesn't have to look into the mirror

882
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,800
to realize that he's not wearing his original mask, does he?

883
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,000
I mean he's wearing something like this!

884
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,200
Since Mummy was originally wrapped up in bandage,

885
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,500
and moreover, if he was put to sleep.

886
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,800
It's no wonder that he didn't realize what had happened.

887
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,000
On top of that, the mask covers and hides everything from neck down,

888
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,100
so even if the color of the necktie changes, it's hard to tell.

889
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,700
Besides, both of them were wearing white gloves

890
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,700
and their outfits are more or less similar.

891
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,300
So I don't think anyone would've suspected anything.

892
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,800
But their physiques are similar

893
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,400
and they hold the same card of the devil,

894
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,000
both of them are reticent,

895
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,500
and they end up in the compartment next to each other.

896
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,300
Doesn't everything fall too much in place?

897
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,500
The only coincidence here is probably the pattern of the card.

898
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,100
The killer was waiting for the right person

899
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,800
to come to the toilet.

900
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,800
There were a lot of passengers who didn't speak a word

901
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,000
because they wanted to sell themselves as monsters.

902
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,500
So, as for piercing the card with the arrow,

903
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,500
the killer probably thought it up right on the spot.

904
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
The person that would be suspected as the killer

905
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,000
would be someone that didn't have his card.

906
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,900
He probably made light of it,

907
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,800
thinking that no one would figure out who the real killer was.

908
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,500
But...

909
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,600
when Sonoko called,

910
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,400
Werewolf came out of the toilet!

911
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,700
If he was drugged to sleep,

912
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,200
how come he came out at such great timing?

913
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Before he came out of the toilet,

914
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,200
you heard something, didn't you?

915
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,400
Oh, I see!

916
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,400
The howling of the wolf!

917
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,000
It seemed that he was playing the howling using a tape recorder.

918
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,200
If he turned the switch on from the toilet compartment next door.

919
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,900
Mummy would be surprised and wake up!

920
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,100
Yeah.

921
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,000
The speaker was probably attached

922
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,900
behind the mask.

923
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,200
The killer attached a wiretap with the speaker

924
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,800
and put the mask on Mummy so that he would react swiftly

925
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,100
to the voices of the people around him.

926
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,100
Even if someone were to talk to him,

927
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,800
Mummy would think that Werewolf was being talked to

928
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,200
because the howling is heard at close range.

929
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,400
I see.

930
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,600
I thought it was strange because each time he heard howling,

931
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,200
he was looking here and there.

932
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,500
That's how Werewolf gave everyone the impression that

933
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,500
he was at the party hall and created his alibi,

934
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,800
then he went up on deck

935
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,400
and fired the arrow from the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

936
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,900
who was on top of the mast!

937
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,300
Then he used the howling to guide him

938
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,300
to where Mummy was among the crowd

939
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,600
and tore off the mask within the crowd

940
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,700
and put it back on himself.

941
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,900
Then he went back inside the crowd of people.

942
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,500
I guess that is how the story goes.

943
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,400
Right, Werewolf?

944
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,000
Am I wrong in any way?

945
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,300
I don't know if you're a high school detective or what

946
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,200
but you can sure blabber on, can't you?

947
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,200
I put this mask on Mummy, you say?

948
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,600
Do you have proof that I did it, or what?

949
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,100
If it's something that points in the direction that you're the killer,

950
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,200
yes.

951
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,100
I have two!

952
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,300
One of it is this!

953
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,900
The hint of the quiz

954
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,600
about there's a human among the monsters here.

955
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,500
Rooster?

956
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,000
Hey, where'd you get that?

957
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,700
It was tied to a rope here.

958
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,300
I think that Mr. Fukuura with the spotlight on himself

959
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,300
was going to do this!

960
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,100
What?

961
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,700
Suspend it upside down?

962
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,100
Upside down?

963
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,600
The opposite of a rooster is...

964
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,000
"Retsoor"?

965
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,600
"Sterroo"?

966
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,900
"Terroos"?

967
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,500
Just what kind of hint is that supposed to be?

968
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,900
"Retsoor"...

969
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,100
I get it.

970
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,300
What?

971
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,400
Roosters are also called cock,

972
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,900
and he's holding it by the tail.

973
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,000
It is said that long ago, all kinds of liquor

974
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,100
were made by stirring them with the tail of the cock.

975
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,300
Therefore, the drinks have been called cocktails since then.

976
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,500
That's the origin of the word cocktail.

977
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,600
What?

978
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,000
You mean "cocktail" is the hint?

979
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,800
Detective Mouri.

980
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,900
You also drank it too, didn't you?

981
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,000
That cocktail.

982
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,700
I'm a beer drinker!

983
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,500
I would never drink...

984
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,200
Come to think of it, I was looking for Werewolf and...

985
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,200
Hey, boss! What's up?

986
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,500
Bartender.

987
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,500
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

988
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,400
I did drink it

989
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,900
now that you mentioned it.

990
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,500
If I remember correctly it was...

991
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,600
A cocktail called Silver Bullet!

992
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,000
We were given instructions

993
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,700
by Mr. Fukuura to drink it at the bar of the party hall!

994
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,000
Which means

995
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,300
you rushed out of the toilet like that back then because...

996
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,600
You fell asleep in the toilet

997
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,600
and still didn't drink the cocktail?

998
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,300
Yes!

999
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,200
That's a coincidence,

1000
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
because I drank it too.

1001
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,600
What?

1002
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,900
You didn't!

1003
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,300
It was Mummy who you had put your mask over!

1004
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,600
It's just as Shinichi had deduced!

1005
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,100
Stop putting on airs, brat!

1006
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,900
I'm the only Werewolf here!

1007
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,700
And Werewolf!

1008
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,600
Did you really drink that cocktail?

1009
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,000
You, who wanted to sell your act as Werewolf,

1010
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,700
and appear in the movie?

1011
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,200
Yeah, to pep me up.

1012
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,000
Or, are you saying that

1013
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,900
Werewolf is not supposed to drink liquor?

1014
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,900
You really drank Silver Bullet?

1015
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,200
Shut up, persistent brat!

1016
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,100
I drank it!

1017
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,800
Silver Bullet?

1018
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,400
Hey, no way.

1019
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,900
Silver Bullet?

1020
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,200
Silver Bullet, that's...

1021
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,100
-Yeah. -Werewolf would never drink it.

1022
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,400
Yes. The name of the cocktail was Silver Bullet.

1023
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,900
Just as the name goes, a silver bullet.

1024
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,100
It's the only weapon in the movie

1025
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,900
that is capable of killing the Werewolf.

1026
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,900
It's a thing that any horror fan would know.

1027
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,100
And a cocktail with that name

1028
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,600
is also used to ward off evil.

1029
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,300
Mr. Fukuura probably intended to use this cocktail as a hint

1030
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,700
and lure people to the bar

1031
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
then later ask the bartender

1032
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,500
who drank what kind of liquor

1033
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,200
and have everyone answer that Mummy who ordered Silver Bullet

1034
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,900
was the human among the monsters.

1035
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,800
Because no monster would go out of their way

1036
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,700
to order liquor to ward off evil.

1037
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,500
Isn't that right, Werewolf?

1038
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,400
Well...

1039
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,100
Since the bartender heard nothing beforehand from Mr. Fukuura,

1040
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,900
he seems to have served Detective Mouri the same liquor, though.

1041
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,600
If Mr. Fukuura was the one who did the makeup for Mummy,

1042
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,900
it's most likely that

1043
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,000
the answer is under the bandage.

1044
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,500
The bull's eye mark

1045
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,400
indicates that you're the answer!

1046
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,600
Excuse me.

1047
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,000
Here it is!

1048
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,900
It says "human".

1049
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,700
"Human"

1050
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,500
And? What about the other evidence?

1051
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,300
Even a marksman at the bow gun

1052
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,200
could never pierce a person with an arrow poked

1053
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,500
with a card through it.

1054
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,300
Of course, he wouldn't be able to do it

1055
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,300
from on top this unstable rope too.

1056
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,400
In order to make sure he kills his target,

1057
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,800
he needs to climb up here and fire at his target at point blank.

1058
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,700
The traces of Werewolf having come up here back then is here.

1059
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,300
What?

1060
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,900
The traces of pieces of glass

1061
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,500
that are embedded into the soles of your shoes

1062
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,600
that you stepped on when you cracked the mirror in the toilet.

1063
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,300
If we have the forensic officers match the pieces

1064
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,100
I'm sure they will match completely.

1065
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,500
Now, Werewolf,

1066
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,100
please show us the soles of your shoes.

1067
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,300
And please tell us

1068
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,900
why you came all the way up here.

1069
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,500
So, please show us then, Werewolf!

1070
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,100
Come on and lift your foot.

1071
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,000
It's not me!

1072
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,500
It... It's not me!

1073
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,200
I had no intention of killing him!

1074
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,000
That devil is to blame.

1075
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,300
What?

1076
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,400
It's all that devil's fault!

1077
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,100
It's that devil's fault!

1078
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,400
The one called Vermouth!

1079
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,500
Ms. Jodie!

1080
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,700
Dr. Araide, what seems to be the matter?

1081
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,300
That's for me to say.

1082
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,500
What do you intend to do with her?

1083
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,800
No! No!

1084
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,500
We were just taking a drive!

1085
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Unlike you,

1086
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,300
I've got a lot of time on my hands!

1087
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,800
Lot of time?

1088
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,900
Dr. Araide, it's almost time

1089
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,400
for the trial for the homicide case, isn't it?

1090
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,400
You've got to testify as would be expected of a good citizen!

1091
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,600
And tell everyone that

1092
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,900
the home helper, Hikaru Yasumoto,

1093
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,800
is the one who pulled the trigger

1094
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,400
and killed your father

1095
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,300
which is a hidden fact.

1096
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,700
Ms. Hikaru pulled the trigger?

1097
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,500
No use playing dumb with me!

1098
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:13,200
Detective Mouri told me the facts about everything!

1099
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,200
Just what are you talking about?

1100
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,700
The killer of the case back then was my stepmother.

1101
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,700
And, besides, he died of electrocution,

1102
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,600
not bullet wounds!

1103
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,600
Did you say Vermouth?

1104
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
Are you saying that you killed Mr. Fukuura

1105
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,000
because that character called Vermouth asked you to do so?

1106
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,100
Hey!

1107
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,800
No.

1108
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,400
It's true that I had a grudge against Mr. Fukuura

1109
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,800
because he concluded the Unlucky Days series

1110
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,200
that I loved more than anything else just like that

1111
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,700
and started this kindergarten-style

1112
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,200
Phantom Ship Captain series.

1113
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:59,600
So, I wrote about this on the BBS of a certain Internet site

1114
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,400
saying that I wanted to work off my grudge.

1115
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,200
Then, this person called Vermouth contacted me.

1116
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,000
She said that she'd tell me how to kill him and prepare the weapons

1117
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,200
if I'd like to carry it out.

1118
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,800
What do you make of the life of a person,

1119
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,900
carrying out murder on a motive like that?

1120
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,700
Of course, I refused at first!

1121
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,300
But, after that...

1122
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,700
pictures of my family and I that were taken secretly,

1123
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,100
along with tapes of wire-taped telephone conversations,

1124
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:31,600
as well as documents with my daily actions written to minute detail...

1125
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,200
A whole cardboard box was delivered to me!

1126
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,800
I was told that if I refused or reported it to the police,

1127
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,700
either my family or I would die.

1128
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,600
Everything I received implicated this!

1129
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,600
His cause of death was electrocution and not by a gun?

1130
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,900
What are you getting at?

1131
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,000
Sorry.

1132
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,600
The trigger I was referring to just now was

1133
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,100
the electricity breaker.

1134
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,900
The killer is the one who rigged everything to commit the murder

1135
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,200
but the one who actually lifted the breaker

1136
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,700
and triggered the murder

1137
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,400
is Hikaru Yasumoto who knew nothing at all.

1138
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,800
Therefore, in order not to hurt her feelings,

1139
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,300
the killer and the police got together

1140
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,200
and made up a fake record of investigation!

1141
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,600
It said that the method of killing was something else.

1142
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,000
Well, it's only natural that you don't know about this!

1143
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,600
Because this wasn't written on the investigation report

1144
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,200
that you stole from the police.

1145
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,900
It was to learn the case and successfully testify in court

1146
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,600
and keep existing as Dr. Araide.

1147
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,200
Am I wrong?

1148
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,100
Who are you?

1149
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,300
"A secret makes a woman, a woman".

1150
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,700
Do you remember?

1151
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,800
These are the final words you left behind with me.

1152
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,700
And the words I kept repeating

1153
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,600
so I don't forget them.

1154
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,100
The words of the one who killed my father.

1155
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,400
Isn't that right,

1156
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,100
Chris Vineyard?

1157
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,400
Rather...

1158
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,100
The other name that you go by...

1159
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,100
Vermouth!

1160
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,310
Who are you?

1161
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,910
It's a secret. A secret.

1162
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:04,510
I can't tell you.

1163
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:09,910
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

1164
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:12,310
Daddy's glasses.

1165
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,110
I'm sorry.

1166
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,510
Daddy. What's the matter?

1167
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,910
Is he already asleep?

1168
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:23,210
He promised to read me a story before going to bed and yet...

1169
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:26,710
Then, will you stay by your father until he gets up?

1170
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,910
Okay!

1171
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:40,710
Then, you set fire to my house

1172
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,110
and burned everything down to ashes.

1173
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:46,710
All of what my father, as an FBI agent,

1174
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:49,210
gathered behind closed doors,

1175
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,610
the investigation data on all of you.

1176
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:59,210
But, I was saved

1177
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,810
because after that...

1178
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:03,310
I remembered that there was no more orange juice

1179
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:05,910
that father always drinks upon getting up

1180
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:10,410
and since he was lying down from exhaustion from afternoon

1181
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:12,410
taking care of my mother who wasn't feeling well.

1182
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:16,010
I wanted to be of help and went out shopping.

1183
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:19,810
Oh, so you're the little girl I saw back then!

1184
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,610
I really went all out looking for you,

1185
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,810
because all that was left from the remains

1186
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:26,110
were the bones of your parents.

1187
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:30,710
My father's colleagues protected me.

1188
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:35,310
They applied for the witness protection program for me.

1189
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:39,210
That stupid system of changing the name and address of a witness

1190
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,610
whose life is in danger in order to protect that person

1191
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,710
under a different identity.

1192
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,310
It must've been really restricting, right?

1193
01:15:56,310 --> 01:16:00,010
To live away from your hometown, as a different person.

1194
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,910
You went through hard times, didn't you?

1195
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,510
And?

1196
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:11,510
You took after your father, and came after me?

1197
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:16,310
FBI agent Jodie Starling?

1198
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:20,010
Just as expected of a witch with a thousand faces, Vermouth.

1199
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,210
With your ability of disguise, you can sneak in anywhere

1200
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:27,010
and check on things to your heart's content.

1201
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:32,210
I'm amazed that you saw through the disguise of Dr. Araide.

1202
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,710
It's obvious.

1203
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:38,110
Despite of not having that bad of an illness,

1204
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:42,410
you keep frequenting Araide Hospital with no makeup.

1205
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:47,410
You were planning to kill him and become him!

1206
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:49,810
Then you mean that...

1207
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:53,810
the time his car passed right before me with his family

1208
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,210
and crashed through the guard rail

1209
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,310
eventually sinking into the sea...

1210
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:01,410
was all set up by you?

1211
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,610
Yes!

1212
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:03,710
I made it look as if he died of an accident

1213
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,710
before you got to kill him.

1214
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:09,510
Because if the car was left at the bottom of the sea

1215
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,710
and if nobody knew that he was dead,

1216
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,710
it would make it easier for you to go around

1217
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,810
acting as Dr. Araide.

1218
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:17,810
Of course,

1219
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:22,810
the people in the car were my colleagues equipped with air pumps.

1220
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:27,410
The real Dr. Araide is living in peace in a place far away.

1221
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:30,110
Then just as we expected,

1222
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,710
you established yourself in Araide Hospital

1223
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,710
and began checking on something.

1224
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:35,910
It was obvious what you waiting for

1225
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:41,310
the moment we snuck into your room in that hospital.

1226
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:44,310
A picture was poked all over with darts.

1227
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:48,810
The picture of a girl in her 20's with reddish brown hair.

1228
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:52,710
You were planning to find her and get rid of her!

1229
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:56,710
Now I have a question!

1230
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:00,910
The picture of the woman you were trying to get hold of and kill

1231
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,310
and this girl that looks just like her.

1232
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,910
Of course the witness protection program

1233
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,410
will be applied to her but...

1234
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,910
Is she really the woman in the picture?

1235
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:15,410
There's still more!

1236
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:19,510
The two pictures that were below her picture,

1237
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:22,910
with the words Cool Guy and Angel that are written on the pictures.

1238
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:25,310
That boy is unmistakably sharp,

1239
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:29,710
but he's more a "kid" than a "guy," isn't he?

1240
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:33,310
Yes. That boy called Conan.

1241
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:37,110
Until that boy left the girl's side,

1242
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,810
you didn't do anything.

1243
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:44,510
Inside the bus that was jacked too.

1244
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,210
Please don't!

1245
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:48,810
It's just the mischief of a child, isn't it?

1246
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:52,210
Will tell me why you went all out to protect that boy

1247
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:55,010
to the point of almost risking your own life?

1248
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,710
If she didn't come around,

1249
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:06,810
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

1250
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,310
So...

1251
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,310
Nab that person called Vermouth too!

1252
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:13,410
And?

1253
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,710
So that name Vermouth, that sounds like the name of some liquor

1254
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,510
is probably a fake name, right?

1255
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,410
Do you know the person's identity?

1256
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,210
You haven't seen that person yourself, either?

1257
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,810
No.

1258
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:27,210
Then, what about the receipts of the things

1259
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:30,010
that you received that she used to blackmail you?

1260
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:32,710
Well...

1261
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:35,510
What? No way!

1262
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,110
You threw them away?

1263
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:43,510
The address is probably a phony one too.

1264
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:44,810
I guess for now...

1265
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:48,510
until we arrive at the harbor, we'll have to keep him tied up somewhere.

1266
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:51,110
So now, the case is closed.

1267
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:02,410
Come on.

1268
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,310
Will you tell me?

1269
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,810
Okay!

1270
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,410
I'll tell you.

1271
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:19,010
That's...

1272
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:29,810
Don't move!

1273
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:38,010
Gosh.

1274
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,510
What a dangerous thing you have there.

1275
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:44,610
Did you get permission from the police in Japan?

1276
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,210
We'll request joint investigation

1277
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:50,910
from the police here after we nab you!

1278
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,610
Of course, I'm willing to take full responsibility for this.

1279
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:58,010
But before that I have something I want to ask you!

1280
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:01,410
And what may that be?

1281
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:05,710
Why don't you...

1282
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:13,110
Why don't you age at all?

1283
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,210
You caught my attention because of what you said

1284
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:28,210
in front of my mother's coffin.

1285
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:32,610
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

1286
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:37,210
I was really excited and started investigating,

1287
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,210
then sure enough, there was a perfect match.

1288
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:42,110
Remember back when you killed my father

1289
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,010
making it look like he committed suicide.

1290
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:46,310
You picked up his glasses trying to replace it

1291
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:49,710
because of the way it lay unnaturally on the floor.

1292
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,410
The fingerprints that were on the lens of the glasses

1293
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:56,110
and yours matched perfectly!

1294
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:58,110
But, I had my doubts.

1295
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:01,010
You were too young to be a suspect of an incident

1296
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,910
that had happened 20 years ago.

1297
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:04,710
I didn't think it possible at first,

1298
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,710
but when I matched your prints with a certain person's,

1299
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:11,510
I got results that made a shiver go up my spine.

1300
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:16,610
You're the one and the same as your mother, Sharon Vineyard!

1301
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:19,810
And, I finally found the witness

1302
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:23,110
that could explain the mystery

1303
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:26,110
of what was keeping you from being arrested!

1304
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:31,810
You guys! Come out and hold this woman!

1305
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:35,210
When I get custody of you from the Japanese police,

1306
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:37,010
I'll make you spit it out.

1307
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,410
You'll tell me everything.

1308
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:41,310
Well, even if you insist on saying nothing,

1309
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,910
she will eventually.

1310
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,910
Thank you, Calvados.

1311
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:11,610
Don't kill her yet.

1312
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:14,710
I've still got something I want to ask her.

1313
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,510
Why?

1314
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:22,010
You all staked out here

1315
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:25,610
and figured you lured me out but...

1316
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:29,210
I came here once already two hours ago,

1317
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,510
disguised as you.

1318
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,210
And this is what I said in your voice.

1319
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:39,410
This is it tonight! Come back tomorrow!

1320
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,210
Didn't you realize?

1321
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:44,610
There was another reason as to why the papers of the cases

1322
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:47,610
that Detective Mouri was involved in were stolen.

1323
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,310
All of the documents were stolen

1324
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:54,010
so that the papers we actually needed would not be specified,

1325
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:57,110
however, all of the documents were sent back to the MPD in one batch

1326
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,910
because I wanted you people to think that my stay in Japan

1327
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,010
had something to do with Detective Mouri

1328
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:07,110
so that you would stake out the detective agency.

1329
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:11,110
Which as a result, it would help me figure out who the FBI agents are.

1330
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:13,710
Just as expected, I figured out how many of you there were,

1331
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,110
the place you were all staying

1332
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,510
and the way you were all communicating.

1333
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:21,310
I also knew that you were trying to trap me here.

1334
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:25,510
Then, you knew that we snuck into your room too?

1335
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:29,010
Yes. I was just playing dumb.

1336
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,810
I thought that if you saw that picture,

1337
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:36,010
you would find her for me.

1338
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:40,610
But you surprised me twice already.

1339
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:43,710
The first is that you are the girl

1340
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:46,010
that I met 20 years ago.

1341
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:47,210
The other is that

1342
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:50,610
you knew what went on behind the scenes regarding Dr. Araide.

1343
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:52,410
How did you get information on it

1344
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:55,310
when nothing about it was spoken to anyone?

1345
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,110
I didn't hear about it from anyone.

1346
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,710
I was asked to do so by someone.

1347
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:04,610
To corner you and disclose your identity,

1348
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,710
and in turn for doing so, she said that she would trust me.

1349
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:10,510
This girl over here.

1350
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:13,810
Oh, I see.

1351
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,710
She said so.

1352
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,010
Anyway, let's hear the whole story

1353
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,610
when we get to the police station!

1354
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:32,110
He solved the case in such a short time!

1355
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:35,010
Just as expected of Shinichi Kudo!

1356
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,410
Fantastic!

1357
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:40,710
It's nothing...

1358
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:42,110
The reason I got to solve it right away

1359
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:46,110
is because I used the same trick as the killer.

1360
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:47,510
Just what does that mean?

1361
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,710
What?

1362
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:52,510
The same trick that Werewolf over there used!

1363
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:57,810
So, this is it, for our re-encounter after 20 years.

1364
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:01,410
It's time to say goodbye.

1365
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:03,810
Come on and smile

1366
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:06,710
because you're going to get to see your father in heaven.

1367
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:21,910
What?

1368
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,810
The same trick as Werewolf used?

1369
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:29,810
The killer put a mask over the victim, who was already disguised.

1370
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,610
Which means he double disguised the victim.

1371
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:36,210
Don't you only have bandages wrapped around you?

1372
01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:38,810
Just what do you mean by that?

1373
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:02,710
Don't tell me that you're...

1374
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:06,510
Yeah.

1375
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:09,610
So this...

1376
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,210
is what I mean!

1377
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:13,010
What?

1378
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,710
You're...

1379
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:19,210
Heiji Hattori?

1380
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:24,110
Cool kid?

1381
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,510
Conan Edogawa.

1382
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,210
A detective!

1383
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,600
He wasn't Shinichi.

1384
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,700
Heiji Hattori?

1385
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,300
Disguise?

1386
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,500
It's a disguise?

1387
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,300
But his voice and tone were just like Shinichi.

1388
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,400
Yes.

1389
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,700
Of course.

1390
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,800
It's my masterpiece that took me six hours to put him on this disguise.

1391
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,800
As for his voice, the microphone on his collar

1392
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,200
picks up the deduction that Heiji whispers into it,

1393
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,900
then Shinichi says it through the microphone on his mask.

1394
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:13,100
That voice output is the speaker on Heiji's necktie.

1395
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,300
How do you like it?

1396
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:18,600
A perfect collaboration by Dr. Agasa and I.

1397
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,900
Okay! We're okay on this side, Kudo!

1398
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,800
Do your thing on your side too, now!

1399
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,300
Don't move!

1400
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,700
Your body's the blind spot for the rifle.

1401
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,200
Now...

1402
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:51,500
get in the car after Ms. Jodie.

1403
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,000
Let's take a drive to the police!

1404
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,000
Ms. Jodie.

1405
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Quick and get in the car!

1406
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,400
Ms. Jodie! Are you all right?

1407
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,800
Yes.

1408
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,000
Don't tell me that?

1409
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,000
Shinichi Kudo?

1410
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,200
Remember? The kid that you poisoned to death

1411
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,600
with the drug made by the organization back then!

1412
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,800
Sorry, Vodka.

1413
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,300
I make it a policy to forget the name and face...

1414
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,700
of the ones I get rid of.

1415
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,800
And?

1416
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,700
Are you saying that the kid rose from the dead

1417
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,200
and appeared as a ghost?

1418
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,100
Yeah, I mean no.

1419
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:02,500
Something strange is happening.

1420
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:08,600
Why are you disguised as Shinichi Kudo in the first place anyway?

1421
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,400
Sorry! Pops!

1422
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,700
I haven't seen Kudo for some time,

1423
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,600
so I got kind of lonely.

1424
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,600
I figured that if I came out looking like him

1425
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,900
and made a deduction, maybe he just might pop out too.

1426
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:27,100
But maybe he's dead, just as rumor has it, don't you think?

1427
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,500
Darn it! Kid from Osaka,

1428
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:33,900
this is the second time you're pulling this trick!

1429
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,000
If Ran were here,

1430
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,900
you'd be way gone by now!

1431
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:41,500
Scary. Give me a break.

1432
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,000
I had no choice.

1433
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,900
After all, Kudo e-mailed me asking me to do this.

1434
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,900
He told me that those guys are trying to pull him away from Ai

1435
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,100
and do something,

1436
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,100
so he wanted me to disguise myself as him and find out about it.

1437
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,500
That's why I'm on board this ship!

1438
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,000
But, it sure freaked me out

1439
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,300
when I got to his house

1440
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,200
and found his mother there.

1441
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,900
She seems to have been worried about him,

1442
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:08,300
and hiding for a while in the house watching him.

1443
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,400
Mother?

1444
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,500
Hey...

1445
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,700
I didn't think she had a special talent to disguise people

1446
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,600
but she would even freak Arsene Lupin out too!

1447
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,800
Thanks to her,

1448
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,100
I didn't have to complete my deduction all bandaged up.

1449
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:33,700
The only one I'm worried about is

1450
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,500
the little girl that is left sleeping

1451
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,000
and confined in the basement of Dr. Agasa's house.

1452
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Kudo says she'll be fine

1453
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,500
if she doesn't have the pursuit glasses

1454
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,900
hidden somewhere with her

1455
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,800
But, if I were her...

1456
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,500
knowing that he would be meeting someone dangerous disguised as me,

1457
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,600
I wouldn't be able to wait for him just like that.

1458
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,500
I would break the door open

1459
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,500
and go after him no matter what.

1460
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:07,100
No matter what, Kudo!

1461
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,900
I'd go after you.

1462
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,700
Haibara. You...

1463
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,500
Haibara?

1464
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:48,700
Darn it!

1465
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,900
Don't come!

1466
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,300
Stay away!

1467
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:05,300
Go back!

1468
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,500
You idiot!

1469
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,500
No, Kudo.

1470
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,000
This is my problem!

1471
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,500
This had nothing to do with you.

1472
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,600
That's why...

1473
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,900
Don't die!

1474
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,900
I don't want you to die!

1475
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,100
So you had the spare pursuit glasses

1476
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:46,000
hidden after all.

1477
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,600
Kudo.

1478
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,000
Run for it, Haibara!

1479
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,400
Hurry!

1480
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,000
Just what are you doing?

1481
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,700
Get out of here, Haibara!

1482
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,100
Hurry and get out!

1483
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:04,400
Quick!

1484
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,700
Goodnight, baby.

1485
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,900
And...

1486
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,700
Welcome...

1487
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,100
Sherry!

1488
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,600
The only reason I can think of

1489
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,900
for Vermouth to go after Haibara's life

1490
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,800
and want me to stay away from her

1491
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,600
is because of her identity as actress Chris Vineyard

1492
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,300
as well as Sharon since she is both of them.

1493
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:13,600
She was probably acting out two roles under disguise.

1494
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,100
If she knows mom,

1495
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:18,800
she would've probably seen pictures of me as a kid,

1496
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,900
so she would've easily made out who I am

1497
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,600
and I also understand why she wouldn't want

1498
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,800
to be messed up with a scandal.

1499
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,400
I'll be fine!

1500
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,200
Don't worry because I promise to make it back alive!

1501
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,200
Is that really true,

1502
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,200
Sharon?

1503
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,700
Stupid woman.

1504
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:54,800
Screwing up this little boy's plan,

1505
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,000
and coming out here on your own initiative to die.

1506
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:04,700
I didn't come here just to die.

1507
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:07,200
I came here to end everything.

1508
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,300
Even if you were to be arrested,

1509
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,200
as long as I'm alive,

1510
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:15,900
you guys will never stop pursuing me.

1511
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,100
But, I'd like you to give me your word.

1512
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:22,800
That you will not lay a hand on anyone else except me.

1513
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,800
Will you promise to give me your word?

1514
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,700
Okay.

1515
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:32,500
I'll save all the others

1516
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,600
except for this woman FBI agent here.

1517
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,400
But first, I'll get rid of you, Sherry.

1518
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,000
If you want to hold a grudge on anyone,

1519
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,100
hate your parents for starting

1520
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:44,000
such a stupid research in the first place.

1521
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,360
Cool kid.

1522
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,560
No way!

1523
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,760
How?

1524
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,760
Stop! Calvados!

1525
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,760
Could it be...

1526
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,360
she saw everything?

1527
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,260
Stop! Calvados!

1528
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,860
Stop!

1529
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,260
Can't you hear I'm telling you to stop?

1530
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,560
So...

1531
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,360
Get away from that brown-haired girl!

1532
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,960
If you don't want to die, you'd better hurry!

1533
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,260
No! Don't move!

1534
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,760
Come on. Hurry! Get out of the way!

1535
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,560
Stop it!

1536
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,660
I called the police.

1537
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:38,160
So just put up with this a while longer. Please!

1538
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,460
Big sis.

1539
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,060
Silver hair?

1540
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,760
The story was meant to end this way.

1541
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,160
Hate God for what is happening to you.

1542
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:14,560
What are you doing?

1543
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,060
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

1544
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:20,060
Hurry or my arm will get slippery from the rain.

1545
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:22,260
Why'd you save me?

1546
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,160
Why on earth?

1547
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,760
Who needs a reason?

1548
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,460
Who cares what the motives are

1549
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,260
for a person to want to kill another person?

1550
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,460
Why would a person want to save another then?

1551
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,560
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

1552
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,160
Get out of the way!

1553
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,560
What are you doing?

1554
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,160
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

1555
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,260
Move it, Angel!

1556
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:16,960
What?

1557
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,060
This is a blind spot for the rifle.

1558
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,960
When did you...

1559
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,560
Throw your gun down.

1560
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,860
Throw your gun down!

1561
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:33,160
If not, I'll aim for your head next.

1562
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,160
The sound of a pump?

1563
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,460
A shotgun?

1564
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,860
Okay! Calvados.

1565
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:47,460
We'll attack them from both sides!

1566
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,460
This is bad.

1567
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:53,660
He's coming from behind.

1568
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:12,760
Come on, Calvados.

1569
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,660
Use that dear shotgun of yours

1570
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:18,960
and blow up the little kitty FBI agent, will you?

1571
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,760
So, his name is Calvados.

1572
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:30,960
A rifle, a shotgun and three guns.

1573
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:36,160
I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

1574
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,160
Shuichi Akai?

1575
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,960
Shu!

1576
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,360
But with two broken legs,

1577
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,960
I don't think he'll be doing business for quite some time.

1578
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:56,460
Well, Calvados is like a strong apple spirit.

1579
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:57,860
So, I guess he's just right

1580
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:00,260
for the partner of a rotten apple like you.

1581
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,860
Rotten apple?

1582
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:05,460
That's the name we call you by.

1583
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:08,160
Golden Apple was the stage

1584
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:11,160
in which the great actress Sharon stole the limelight.

1585
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:14,460
You're just as beautiful now as you were back then but...

1586
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:18,360
Inside, you're a wrinkled up rotten apple.

1587
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,760
A really rotten apple!

1588
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:38,360
Don't, Shu!

1589
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,160
Don't worry.

1590
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:42,460
I can tell from the way she moves

1591
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:45,060
that she's wearing a bullet proof jacket

1592
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:47,460
and layers of bullet proof pads all over her body.

1593
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:49,960
I think she'll get two or three broken ribs at most.

1594
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,860
Moreover, look.

1595
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:55,460
Look at her face that tore apart with the shot that was fired.

1596
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:59,760
That's the face of that woman with no make-up after all.

1597
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,160
The brats are a nuisance!

1598
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,860
Cool kid.

1599
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,660
To think she can blow up the gasoline tank

1600
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,760
by looking over the mirror in that situation.

1601
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,160
She's pretty good.

1602
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,460
Shu!

1603
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,560
This is no time to be amazed by her!

1604
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,360
She took a child hostage and got away, you know?

1605
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,060
Then why didn't you take the key out of the car?

1606
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,960
Well, I'm sorry.

1607
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,760
We did get our share though,

1608
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,160
because that woman's comrade is...

1609
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,460
Hey...

1610
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:40,660
Don't tell me he still had a gun on him?

1611
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,560
Could it be that he killed himself?

1612
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,860
Look at that.

1613
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,360
The Japanese police are here.

1614
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:55,160
This girl must've called them.

1615
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,160
Inside the trunk,

1616
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,760
it's hard to make out conversation

1617
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:01,060
but bullets can be heard.

1618
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,160
I'm sure

1619
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:05,160
she saw the pictures in my room and got suspicious,

1620
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,160
and snuck inside my car

1621
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,060
in order to investigate me.

1622
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:14,060
She heard the bullets and came outside.

1623
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:18,860
Then protected the brown haired girl, who had a gun pointed at her.

1624
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:22,060
They probably thought they were shot

1625
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:25,360
and both passed out.

1626
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,060
Geez.

1627
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:30,360
I don't know if you can say they got guts or not.

1628
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,660
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you.

1629
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,260
Just go ahead and explain to them that

1630
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:37,060
you're an FBI agent on a long leave of absence came to Japan

1631
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:40,760
and got mixed up in a child kidnapping case.

1632
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,160
Since that woman got away,

1633
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:49,960
nobody would believe anything we say anyway.

1634
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,360
The big guy behind all this hasn't come up front yet.

1635
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,660
And besides I can't have

1636
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:00,360
that girl with the brown hair see me yet.

1637
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:35,360
"Seems that I gave you too much freedom before."

1638
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,460
"Return to me immediately, Vermouth."

1639
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:41,260
Okay, boss.

1640
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,460
Now...

1641
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:51,760
This child.

1642
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,360
What shall do with this child who thinks

1643
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,860
he is capable of doing everything?

1644
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,260
The electrodes of an ECG monitor?

1645
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:21,360
There is a tracing device as well as a recorder.

1646
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,760
Don't tell me that

1647
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,960
the sound of the telephone I made just a while ago was.

1648
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,660
Don't.

1649
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:29,460
If you pull that out,

1650
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:32,260
it means that my heart has stopped

1651
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:35,260
and the mail address of the boss you sent an e-mail to

1652
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:38,560
will be disclosed to my friend.

1653
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,160
The telephone company must protect the privacy of their clients.

1654
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,560
But the police

1655
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:47,060
can get that information if they fill out a special form

1656
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:49,460
and have one of the higher-ups put a seal on it,

1657
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:52,760
then have the information disclosed before several witnesses.

1658
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,660
If the call that was received was not from a cell phone,

1659
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:59,560
but a regular home phone, even the address would be disclosed!

1660
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:00,660
In other words,

1661
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:02,260
if the sound just now is recorded

1662
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:05,660
and analyzed to decipher the alphabets and number,

1663
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:10,160
the name of your boss, as well as his whereabouts can be tracked down!

1664
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,660
That is, even if I were to be killed!

1665
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:13,760
Well,

1666
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,760
I did figure that if you found Sherry,

1667
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:20,160
who you guys are going nuts looking for,

1668
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,260
you would unmistakably contact your big boss.

1669
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:28,360
Since things began to look dangerous for Ms. Jodie,

1670
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:31,060
I had to change my plans.

1671
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:34,560
So, what are you going to do now?

1672
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,060
My friends are waiting for contact from me

1673
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:41,960
at a distant place from here.

1674
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,460
If you don't want this to go out,

1675
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,660
take me to your boss!

1676
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:52,960
Let's get things over with once and for all, Vermouth!

1677
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:57,260
I want to stop playing hide-and-seek already!

1678
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,860
Okay.

1679
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:05,560
I lost.

1680
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,960
I'll give up going after Sherry.

1681
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:18,460
It's mere sleeping gas.

1682
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,060
You idiot!

1683
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:22,460
If you do something like this, you'll suck in the gas too.

1684
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:25,760
Yes. This is a gamble.

1685
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,760
If you get up first,

1686
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,460
you go ahead and call the police and have me arrested,

1687
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:34,160
then go raid the boss along with them.

1688
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,260
You already know what happens

1689
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:38,960
if I get up first, don't you?

1690
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,360
Bad news!

1691
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,460
I've got to go wake him up right away.

1692
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:48,760
Shinichi!

1693
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,460
Shinichi...

1694
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:30,560
You guys were blasted by Shuichi Akai?

1695
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,560
Yes.

1696
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,360
He just happened to find us by,

1697
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:37,460
and Calvados ended up with three broken ribs.

1698
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:41,060
You mean that FBI agent that you failed to get rid of

1699
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,260
back in New York a year ago,

1700
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:47,260
when you disguised yourself as serial killer.

1701
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:48,960
I thought he'd be off his guard if he figured

1702
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,660
I was just an ordinary killer, but...

1703
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,560
I should've gotten rid of him back then

1704
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,060
even if I had to risk being killed myself.

1705
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,060
Our boss said that

1706
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,660
that person

1707
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:25,760
could be our silver bullet.

1708
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,760
He is to be feared.

1709
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:37,760
A silver bullet that capable to kill us in one shot

1710
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,760
doesn't exist.

1711
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,460
At any rate, I'm in a phone booth on route 20,

1712
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,760
so can you come pick me up?

1713
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,160
I got into a bit of trouble,

1714
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,860
and can't move.

1715
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:54,460
Before that, I have something I want to ask you.

1716
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:59,760
Do you know a kid by the name of Shinichi Kudo?

1717
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,760
No.

1718
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,460
I don't.

1719
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:08,760
Why did you save me?

1720
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,960
Who needs a reason?

1721
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,260
Why would a person want to save another then?

1722
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:18,760
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

1723
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:24,260
Yes, it's him.

1724
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:33,160
He, the one who pierced through our heart,

1725
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,960
could prove to be him.

1726
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:48,660
The one that we have long awaited,

1727
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,660
the silver bullet.
