1
00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:04,756
Iron Badger the great safe

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:06,956
at the residence of Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki,

3
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:09,456
is the impregnable great safe

4
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:11,256
that the great puppeteer of the days of Tokugawa,

5
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:14,256
Kichiemon Samizu had made.

6
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,056
Thief Kid sends a letter of challenge against Iron Badger.

7
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,956
He says that he will open the door of Iron Badger

8
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:24,856
that no thief has ever been able to open before.

9
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:27,956
However, because of the weight sensor that works in link

10
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:30,956
with the security device that Jirokichi had installed it is really tough,

11
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:33,456
even to try to get close to it.

12
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:36,456
On the day the crime was to be carried out,

13
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:40,756
Inspector Nakamori and his men secure the area with tight security

14
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,256
but, as if to despise the device,

15
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:45,056
in the room where the safe is, equipped with sensor and all,

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,556
Thief Kid's second letter of challenge is found there.

17
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:53,556
How on earth did he make it through the weight sensor?

18
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:57,156
Has Thief Kid already snuck into the house?

19
00:00:57,156 --> 00:01:02,156
And how does he propose to open the door of Iron Badger?

20
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,156
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

21
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:08,656
Saturday nights are for mystery.

22
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,656
An unexpected treasure is found in the safe.

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,756
Thief Kid finally shows is identity!

24
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,356
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:16,056
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:18,556
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:04,987
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 2)"

28
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,287
Hey.

29
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,987
Did you find Thief Kid?

30
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:14,887
No, not yet.

31
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:19,087
I don't think you should walk through this corridor.

32
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:22,087
Why not?

33
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:26,387
Because you'll be suspected as being Thief Kid.

34
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,687
Thanks to this brat!

35
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:33,687
Well, that puts me in a fix.

36
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:38,687
I was told to deliver this meal to master.

37
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:39,887
To Uncle?

38
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,087
Yes.

39
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,687
I just came here so I didn't know but...

40
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:50,087
it seems he recently eats just his dinner alone in his study.

41
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,987
And, for some reason, it seems that

42
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:55,187
when the dishes are taken from his study after dinner,

43
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,987
two dishes are always missing.

44
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,787
Why would the dishes disappear?

45
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,587
-I wonder. -The strange things

46
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:06,187
are not just the dinner and the missing dishes.

47
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:12,387
It seems that he goes into the safe room to check the safe.

48
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:17,187
I hear that he always has a cane with him at that time too.

49
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:20,687
You mean, Uncle who's almost always too energetic for his age?

50
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:21,887
Yes.

51
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,687
It's most likely that he can't open the safe

52
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:28,887
unless he has that cane and dishes.

53
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,087
No matter if the safe is guarded by a security device

54
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:33,087
that works in link with a weight sensor

55
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,087
that reacts to even one cigarette,

56
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:39,487
there's no point if the safe itself opens really easily.

57
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,487
I'm out of cigarettes.

58
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,587
-Ms. Seto. -Yes?

59
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,487
The extension rang a while ago.

60
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,487
Mr. Akitsu!

61
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,187
Oh, yes?

62
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:53,687
I'm sorry to bother you, but would you go buy me cigarettes?

63
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,087
All right.

64
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,187
I got a call from master a while ago,

65
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,787
asking if his dinner's not ready yet.

66
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:04,187
Okay, I'll deliver it to him!

67
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,587
Right away!

68
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,887
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,987
I'm sorry!

70
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,287
No problem.

71
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,587
Just what's taking you so long?

72
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,587
Hurry and bring my dinner!

73
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,487
Yes, right away, sir!

74
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,987
They're all wet.

75
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,287
No problem.

76
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:36,187
Be it the secretary or the maid,

77
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:39,187
hiring two that are totally useless.

78
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:41,487
Thank you.

79
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:47,087
He, the bodyguard is the only one that's dependable!

80
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:50,087
What did you want with me?

81
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:51,087
What do I want?

82
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,887
Oh, didn't you say

83
00:05:53,887 --> 00:06:00,087
you wanted a helping hand, when I bring dinner to you here?

84
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,487
Oh, that's right.

85
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,787
First, let's go to the room!

86
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,887
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:16,987
What?

88
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,687
You're going to stop the security device?

89
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:22,487
When Thief Kid may be coming?

90
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:24,887
Yeah, that's right!

91
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:27,087
It's daily routine for me

92
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,287
to check inside the safe, you see!

93
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:33,587
I hope he's not Thief Kid.

94
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:41,587
Well, I'll be done in two or three minutes!

95
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,787
Don't you dare look inside till then!

96
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:53,987
The more I want to look when told not to.

97
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:58,187
No!

98
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:01,287
Oh, I thought so too.

99
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,487
And, can you also be quiet?

100
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:07,787
Advisor is making a call, you see.

101
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,587
A call?

102
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:13,487
He's always talking to someone inside!

103
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:16,287
He could be talking to himself, though.

104
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:19,787
Don't tell me that he forgot how to open the safe

105
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,887
and is asking somebody how to do it.

106
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:23,987
I wonder.

107
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:29,287
Advisor Suzuki recently eats dinner alone in his study.

108
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,187
And for some reason two dishes disappear.

109
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:34,687
When he goes to check the safe room later,

110
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,187
he, for some reason brings a cane,

111
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:39,687
and talks to someone while doing the check.

112
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,087
Moreover, that weird letter of challenge.

113
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:52,187
It can't be?

114
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,487
Conan!

115
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:57,287
Dinner's ready!

116
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,387
Okay, the check's over!

117
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:04,687
You can do what you like now!

118
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,287
Before you go back to your room,

119
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:11,887
may I check your body as well as the contents inside your bag?

120
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:15,387
Yeah, I guess, why not?

121
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:18,487
By the way, what's in the bag?

122
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:20,887
Not much.

123
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:22,587
Just an old album,

124
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:23,787
and a composition that I wrote,

125
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:26,187
and a picture that I drew when I was a child.

126
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:30,087
I have this urge to take it to my room and look at them sometimes.

127
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:33,087
It's true that there's only an album inside the bag.

128
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,287
Oh, right,

129
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:37,687
I'm going out now, but don't bother with me.

130
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,687
I had completely forgot that

131
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,687
I promised to have a meal with Mr. Chaki!

132
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,087
With Superintendent Chaki?

133
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:48,787
Here's the car key!

134
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,687
Park the car in the back.

135
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,887
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:56,787
Well, I guess me not being here will not be a problem!

137
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:01,987
Because this little genius his arch rival is here!

138
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:05,687
I'll leave the rest to you, little genius!

139
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:06,787
Yep!

140
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:11,487
Announcing to all men guarding the Suzuki residence.

141
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:14,787
It's already time that Thief Kid announced that he'd be coming!

142
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,087
Remember, stay on guard all of you!

143
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:19,987
Don't be off your guard even when seeing a familiar face!

144
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:22,487
The man next to you may be Thief Kid!

145
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:26,387
After all, he's a master of disguise!

146
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:30,387
I wonder who he's disguised as. Thief Kid.

147
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:34,087
That brat was giving his piece of mind a while ago saying that,

148
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:36,687
the one who can place the letter of challenge in there

149
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:40,187
when the security device was turned off the first time is

150
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:43,187
the tanned bodyguard, Goto,

151
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:46,287
the sort of dense secretary, Akitsu,

152
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:50,087
and the klutzy maid, Mizuki.

153
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:53,787
Well, that bodyguard is clear!

154
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,887
He went out a while ago with Uncle Jirokichi, besides.

155
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,387
Then, is it either Mr. Akitsu or the maid?

156
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:02,887
It could be Akitsu.

157
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:07,987
He hasn't been around ever since he went out to buy my cigarette.

158
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:12,087
But, the maid seemed to be acting deliberately klutzy too.

159
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,987
There's one more suspicious person!

160
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,187
You know, Uncle Jirokichi!

161
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:20,287
What?

162
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,887
If your Uncle is Thief Kid,

163
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,987
he has the switch to the security device,

164
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:27,787
so it would be easy for him to put the letter of challenge there, right?

165
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:30,987
I guess so, but...

166
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:34,087
You didn't say that before!

167
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,387
I just realized it now.

168
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:40,687
Besides, when you scattered the coins,

169
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:44,187
Uncle Jirokichi picked them up and threw them to you, right?

170
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:45,687
Yeah.

171
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,387
Which hand did he throw it with?

172
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,787
I think it was his right hand.

173
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:55,587
Then which hand did Uncle Jirokichi throw

174
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:58,987
the car key that he threw to the bodyguard with?

175
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:02,787
If I remember correctly...

176
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,587
His left hand!

177
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,587
Hey, is that true?

178
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,687
Yep, back then

179
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:11,387
he took the key from his chest pocket using his right hand

180
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,587
and shifted it over to his left hand

181
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,887
when threw it to the bodyguard.

182
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,387
That's why I thought it was strange.

183
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,287
You mean, he's Thief Kid inside?

184
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:25,187
Then, shouldn't you tell Inspector Nakamori about this right away?

185
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:28,787
If they go after him now, they may still be able to catch him!

186
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,787
Right!

187
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:35,287
What? That old man may be Thief Kid?

188
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:37,087
No darn way!

189
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,387
But Advisor Suzuki switched off the security device a while ago

190
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:44,887
and went inside the safe room, didn't he?

191
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:49,787
Yeah, he went in there to do a routine check of the safe!

192
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,787
And, we did a full body check

193
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,687
as well as check the bag that he had,

194
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:58,287
but found nothing suspicious!

195
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:01,487
Besides, that old man went out with Superintendent Chaki just now

196
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,787
to grab a bite to eat!

197
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:07,187
So, how the heck could he be Thief Kid?

198
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:09,587
What about me?

199
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,687
Superintendent Chaki?

200
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:19,787
Aren't you supposed to be having dinner with Advisor Suzuki?

201
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:21,287
You idiot!

202
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,387
Why would I be doing something easygoing like that

203
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:26,087
at a time like this?

204
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:31,387
I went to the master's room to retrieve the dishes after dinner

205
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:34,687
and found that the closet door was opened slightly,

206
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,187
so I looked inside.

207
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:40,487
And found master was tied and sleeping inside!

208
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,687
Then, the old man that just left was...

209
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:48,787
Inspector!

210
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,387
I just checked.

211
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,487
I found many steel wires set up with a sign written,

212
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,687
"Danger, do not touch."

213
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:00,287
Therefore, it's hard to do anything.

214
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,287
That's ridiculous,

215
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,687
the time that old man came into this room

216
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,887
was just for two to three minutes.

217
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:11,787
Thief Kid?

218
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:20,087
"This is to confirm that I have searched inside Iron Badger". It says?

219
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:21,487
I see.

220
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:25,587
He was only after opening the door of the safe to begin with anyway.

221
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:29,087
So, he already carried out what he was planning to do?

222
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:30,087
How dare he?

223
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:33,787
Oh, I think it'd better not to go inside!

224
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:34,887
If it were Thief Kid,

225
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:39,487
I think he'd leave the security switched on.

226
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:44,387
Okay, Squad A get together with the bomb disengaging squad

227
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:46,787
and head on to rescue Mr. Suzuki!

228
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:52,387
All the rest of you, go after that guy and nab him!

229
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,687
It seems a bit boisterous behind us.

230
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:06,887
Never mind, let them be.

231
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,987
I assumed it would turn out this way.

232
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:21,498
Until just a while ago, there were so many squad people here...

233
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:24,398
It seems to have been a dream.

234
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:29,698
They still seem to be taking rescue procedures in Uncle's room.

235
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:34,698
But to think that Uncle was Thief Kid,

236
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:37,798
I should've talked to him a lot more.

237
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:41,098
About that, somehow doesn't something bother you?

238
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:44,398
The first one who switched off the security device

239
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:47,498
and put the letter of challenge there

240
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,398
was Thief Kid, right?

241
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,498
But, the Jirokichi that picked up the coins later

242
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:53,798
was the real one.

243
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:57,398
The last one who threw the car key

244
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,398
was Thief Kid, right?

245
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,498
It sure is weird.

246
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:03,498
The real one came after Thief Kid

247
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:06,398
and the last one again is Thief Kid.

248
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,798
I wonder when they switched.

249
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:14,298
Hey, Conan, don't you think it's weird too?

250
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,798
He's gone again!

251
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:20,998
Well, that guy's Thief Kid, the magician under the moon.

252
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:22,998
So I'm sure he worked something ingenious out.

253
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:27,098
Hey, when you find that brat, we'll get ready to head on home!

254
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,998
Talk about no fun.

255
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,798
You really like to...

256
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,898
disguise yourself as a woman, don't you?

257
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:52,498
It's just so much more cute this way.

258
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:53,998
When did you figure it out?

259
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,798
Until the time you were urged to hurry and take the dinner to him

260
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:59,898
and you rushed to take it, then hit Pops in the rear end,

261
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:02,998
you were probably acting out being a klutz.

262
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:06,398
But, Pops dropping his coin purse from the impact

263
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,698
and the coins scattering all around were not what you expected.

264
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:13,498
Since you carelessly were not ready for this,

265
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,098
and couldn't afford picking the coins up with your bare hands,

266
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:17,898
but thought it unnatural not doing anything

267
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,798
and ignoring the situation,

268
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:23,798
so you spilled the water, right?

269
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,598
If the coins are wet,

270
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,498
even if you pick the coins up wiping them with a handkerchief,

271
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:29,598
it wouldn't look all that strange!

272
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,698
You figured out that I was Thief Kid with only that much info?

273
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:38,498
That word that you told the advisor!

274
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,298
Oh, didn't you say

275
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:46,398
you wanted a helping hand, when I bring dinner to you here?

276
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,398
That's when I figured out

277
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:54,098
the mystery of the first letter of challenge!

278
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,098
If you read the sentences in that letter

279
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,898
by connecting the letters on the very bottom from the left,

280
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:05,198
it reads, "Give me a helping hand!"

281
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,498
In other words, that letter of challenge

282
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,998
was something that the advisor himself had written

283
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:13,698
to Thief Kid asking for help!

284
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:17,098
You disclosed your identity to the advisor with that phrase,

285
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,698
was told in this room about the strategy

286
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,398
to get the squad men out of here, right?

287
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:23,998
You let him throw the key with his left hand,

288
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,498
made him lie about the dinner with the Superintendent

289
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:27,198
that would be disclosed in no time at all

290
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:30,698
and made him post the card of Thief Kid on the safe.

291
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:34,598
All to give people the illusion that the advisor was Thief Kid.

292
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,998
Is the man tied up in the closet

293
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:42,698
Mr. Akitsu who was put to sleep and disguised as the advisor?

294
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:50,098
You seem to be having a tough time.

295
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,398
Do you want help?

296
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:55,098
The door behind you.

297
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:57,198
It looks like something's poked onto it

298
00:17:57,198 --> 00:17:58,598
a lot of times, doesn't it?

299
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:00,498
Yeah.

300
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:05,298
I'm pretty sure that if I turn this dial carelessly...

301
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,798
See?

302
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,098
So I guess you should leave things up to a professional!

303
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:28,898
Hey. Aren't the tiles over there strangely new?

304
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:31,198
See, over here.

305
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:43,198
Just as would be expected

306
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:46,798
of a great safe that was made by the genius maker of gadgets, Kichiemon.

307
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,398
"You lose" -I don't need this, though.

308
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:04,598
Then, you already know why I was called here, right?

309
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,198
After all, you chased the police away

310
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:08,298
knowing that it was my strategy.

311
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:12,798
Yeah, from the recent strange actions of the advisor.

312
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,098
He started eating dinner in his own room every night

313
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:18,298
to get fresh water.

314
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,298
He took two dishes that was served at dinner

315
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:27,598
and used one for water and the other to put dog food in.

316
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:31,898
And, he used his cane to push the two dishes

317
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:35,098
under the space beneath the safe!

318
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:39,298
He would say things like, "Just a little while more."

319
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:40,398
Yeah!

320
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:52,998
He did it for the unfortunate one that was swallowed by Iron Badger.

321
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,098
Him, over here!

322
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:05,098
Hey, cut it out!

323
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:09,398
According to the old man, it's written on the back of the bandana.

324
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:12,198
The way to open this Iron Badger!

325
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:15,898
He used to open Iron Badger each time by reading it.

326
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,098
Then, just as I thought...

327
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:21,898
Yeah, he found out that his dog Lupin wasn't around

328
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:25,698
after he closed the door of this safe.

329
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:29,698
So, having no choice, he came crying to me for help!

330
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:33,898
The only one who can open this crazy safe in a short time is...

331
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,698
None other than me, Thief Kid, you see!

332
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,698
Like I've been telling you!

333
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:48,998
I'm the real Jirokichi Suzuki!

334
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,498
Liar!

335
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:52,498
Superintendent Chaki said

336
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:55,598
he made no promise to go have dinner with you!

337
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:56,998
It's not Chaki!

338
00:20:56,998 --> 00:21:01,498
I promised to see an old friend called Chiaki, you idiot!

339
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:04,298
Chiaki?

340
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:09,198
Which means that Thief Kid is still in that house?

341
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,998
So, they've finally found out that the old man is real and came back.

342
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,698
You're sure reckless, though.

343
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:23,698
One false move, and you'd be nabbed.

344
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:27,598
Yeah. At first I thought it was a trap,

345
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:29,698
but after sneaking in and finding out the reason,

346
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:31,498
I decided to give him a hand.

347
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:36,498
All thieves are great fans of "Gentleman Thief", you see.

348
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:40,398
I felt sorry for Lupin being held captive in the dark behind bars,

349
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,898
so I decided to lend a hand.

350
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:55,498
What a snob, like always.

351
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,098
Don't get too attached to me.

352
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:05,098
I mean, you're my enemy, because of your name, you see.

353
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:30,498
What? Lupin was locked up in that safe?

354
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:33,698
And, he made Thief Kid open it for him?

355
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:36,398
It's supposed to be a secret, though.

356
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:41,298
I guess, that old man owes Thief Kid one, now.

357
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:45,698
Yes. He was saying he had to thank him.

358
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:49,698
After handcuffing both his hands!

359
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:52,398
That's what he said.

360
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:55,598
Oh, I see.

361
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:57,798
Just as I thought.

362
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,380
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,000
"Webcam"
