1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,240
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
The bond of friendship is shattered by sad mistrust.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,340
Money can't buy happiness.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,360
When we, the Youth Detective Squad,

9
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,760
come along to camp with Dr. Agasa,

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,460
we happen to run into four university students

11
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,560
who are a part of the Outdoor Club, riding a luxurious camping car.

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,060
They are Reiji Fukuura,

13
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,260
Yasumi Shirafuji

14
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,360
Haruka Tendo

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,660
and Takuto Meshiai.

16
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,160
But while we were all having barbecue and chatting away

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,360
Ms. Shirafuji disappears.

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,860
So while we left to look for her,

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,760
we headed to the scenic point to watch the fireworks

20
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,860
but she wasn't there either.

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,760
On the way back to the camping grounds,

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,360
we find Ms. Yasumi Shirafuji lying dead

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
in the middle of a winding road!

24
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,960
Which means that the killer is someone

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,860
who could freely take the bicycle from the camping car.

26
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,960
Yeah.

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,760
Her friends who belong to the same circle.

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,160
The probability of the killer being among the three is high!

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,760
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 2)"

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,260
Wait a minute, officer!

31
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,260
Why do we have to be questioned for alibi?

32
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,160
Yasumi died of an accident, didn't she?

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,560
Well, it's just to be sure!

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
So, please tell us where you all were

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
around 5 pm to 6 pm when Ms. Yasumi died.

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,560
"Haruka Tendo (21)" -Well, we were all doing different things

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,160
moving around here and there.

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,260
"Takuto Meshiai (23)" -I was fishing alone.

39
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,860
"Reiji Fukuura (21)" -I was keeping watch over time and camping!

40
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,160
Then, who drives the camping car?

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Reiji used to be in a car club before so he's good at driving.

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,260
Hey...

43
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,160
If it's just moving the car, all three of us can do it!

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,860
Meshiai sometimes takes over driving for me,

45
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,360
and Haruka's the one who brings this car to our meeting place!

46
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,460
Why are you asking us something like this?

47
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,860
Well, I figured if you can't drive the car,

48
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,860
it would be impossible to move the corpse to where it was.

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,460
So, you're suspecting us after all?

50
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,960
Yeah, right!

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
If you leave Ms. Yasumi's body

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,960
in the middle of the street beforehand,

53
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,560
and pretend not to see her on the way uphill,

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,860
then act as if you saw her for the first time on your way back,

55
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,260
it's not impossible.

56
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,660
Moreover, there aren't many cars going through here,

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,260
and if the driver is the killer

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,460
with nobody riding in the passenger's seat

59
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,460
when going uphill...

60
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,060
It's true that when I was driving,

61
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,160
nobody was sitting in the passenger's seat.

62
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
If I drove in the oncoming lane,

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,460
the view outside the window would change

64
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,360
and somebody sitting in the backseat would've noticed,

65
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,260
and besides, I could never do such thing as

66
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,460
to avoid somebody lying in the middle of the road

67
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,060
without changing lanes.

68
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,660
Besides, when we passed here the sunroof was open,

69
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,960
and we were sticking our heads out of it,

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,560
but there was nothing on the road.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,060
You stuck your heads out of the sunroof?

72
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,460
Yes. When we did so last year,

73
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,260
we saw fireworks from between the mountains.

74
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,460
So, we wanted to show those children the same thing too.

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,960
Well, but you can only catch a view of it for about ten seconds

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,060
until turning at the curve.

77
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,860
But if you open the sunroof

78
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,560
after you successfully avoid the corpse then...

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,460
That is why I said it's impossible to avoid the corpse!

80
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,160
Right. The car didn't weave

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,760
before or after the sunroof was opened.

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,560
What is that?

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,460
There are strange looking lines on the edge of the sunroof.

84
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,660
It can't be?

85
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,760
Conan?

86
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,660
Hey, Conan!

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
What are these lines?

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,560
This is blood.

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,260
Blood dried in streaks.

90
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,560
I see. So, that's the story.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,860
I've figured this case out!

92
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,560
And the only one who could've worked out

93
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,760
this high-level trick is

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
that person!

95
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,060
My flashlight.

96
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,360
There!

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Thank God. Thank you. Genta!

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Are you all right?

99
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,660
Thank you, Ai...

100
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,360
Please be careful!

101
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,760
It's sort of windy today

102
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
and the car is slanted because it's a slope here.

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,160
It's not too bad up here on the roof of the car, is it?

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,560
Because the night view is so nice.

105
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,260
This is the place

106
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,560
where we watched the fireworks from the car!

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,860
It's over here?

108
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,960
Wait a second.

109
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,660
Then, the trick that I was thinking of a while ago...

110
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,160
Hey, everyone!

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,860
It's dangerous climbing up a place like that.

112
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
Conan?

113
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,160
Hey, Conan! Where do you think you're going?

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,560
Close call...

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,060
I was about to fall for the killer's trap.

116
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,160
The real trick is...

117
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,360
I found it! This is it!

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,060
Did you find something?

119
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,960
Yes, a vinyl sheet.

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,860
It seems to have blood on it!

121
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,260
What?

122
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,860
True.

123
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,860
We'd better report this right away to Inspector Megure.

124
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,160
But I sure am in a fix.

125
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,660
Anybody can use this trick

126
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,060
and there is no evidence to specify the killer.

127
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,860
I'll just have to show the sheet

128
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,560
and watch how he responds.

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,760
What? A blood smeared vinyl sheet?

130
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,060
Yes! It was stuck on a guard rail

131
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,660
about 50m downhill from here!

132
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,560
I see. It sure is blood.

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,860
Hey, isn't that the sheet that we always use

134
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,360
when we go camping?

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
What did you say?

136
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Will you come here and confirm it?

137
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
Yeah.

138
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,860
Just as I thought!

139
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,360
Yeah.

140
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,460
We haven't been using it recently

141
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,360
because it has a hole in it.

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,960
But why would it be in a place like this?

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
No good.

144
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,060
None of them are reacting at all.

145
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,360
I've got to search the mountains

146
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,560
and look for some other evidence.

147
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,560
I see. I get it.

148
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,660
Blood splattered on the killer.

149
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,160
I can understand that it was done on the spur of the moment.

150
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,660
But, now the killer has no way out.

151
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,560
The killer's made a grave mistake.

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,860
So, like I've been telling you!

153
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,560
At around 7 pm when we passed here

154
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,560
with the camping car to look for Yasumi,

155
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
there was nothing on the road.

156
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
And two hours later, when we came back,

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
we found Yasumi lying in the middle of the road!

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,160
The only thing that was on the road was the wooden fence

159
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
that fell from right above this road!

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,360
And didn't you say so yourself, officer?

161
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
That the place where the fence was broken,

162
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,260
the place where the broken piece was

163
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,060
and the place where Yasumi's body was

164
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,160
were all in one straight line.

165
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,360
The traces of the wheels were found near the broken fence

166
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
and the bicycle was stuck in the bushes outside the guard rail

167
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
where the piece of broken fence was, so...

168
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,860
Yasumi probably accidentally crashed through the fence

169
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,660
and fell to her death.

170
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
You also explained that we didn't see Yasumi

171
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,060
when we first passed here

172
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,260
because she was probably stuck in the bushes with her bicycle

173
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,560
and then slid down to the road

174
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,960
just before we passed here on our way back, didn't you?

175
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,660
Yes, that's right.

176
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,060
Then, it was an accident after all!

177
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,060
Why do we have to be suspected?

178
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,260
There are no blood stains

179
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,660
on the road that Ms. Yasumi was thought to have fallen to.

180
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,360
If she crashed through the fence and fell,

181
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,060
isn't it strange that there's not even a drop of blood

182
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,760
on the road where she fell?

183
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,260
No. Are you saying that Yasumi was...

184
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,660
And this vinyl sheet!

185
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,360
If these blood stains are Ms. Yasumi's,

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,260
it has something to do with the killing...

187
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,060
It sure is connected to the killing!

188
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
What?

189
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,860
Dr. Agasa?

190
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Dr. Agasa.

191
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
With the window closed,

192
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,660
it's hard to hear my deduction, isn't it?

193
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,860
Will you please open the sunroof for me?

194
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, yes!

195
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,360
Why are you on top of the car like that?

196
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,660
I just wanted to know what it feels like.

197
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,860
To be loaded on the roof of a camping car after being killed.

198
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,360
Just like how Ms. Yasumi was!

199
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,580
To be loaded on the roof of a camping car after being killed.

200
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,080
Just like how Ms. Yasumi was!

201
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Which means that the killer loaded Ms. Yasumi's body

202
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
on the roof of this car after all.

203
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,280
Yes! The killer under the pretense of going to look for Ms. Yasumi

204
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,880
got into the car together with us

205
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,380
and dropped Ms. Yasumi's body

206
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,680
from the top of the roof on the way!

207
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Ms. Yasumi was probably killed this way.

208
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,280
The killer probably asked Ms. Yasumi

209
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,680
to climb up and wipe the dirty sunroof or something.

210
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,480
And Ms. Yasumi probably agreed,

211
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,280
which after the killer snuck up behind her and hit her head

212
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,980
with a stone or something!

213
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,380
As proof of that, there is a streak of reddish black line

214
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,780
on the glass of the sunroof!

215
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,780
A streak of blood that remained in the corner

216
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,080
when the killer wiped off the blood that splattered on when he hit her!

217
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,780
But, gramps,

218
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,080
how was Yasumi's body dropped just right in place like that?

219
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,580
We were all in the car, you know?

220
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,180
Fukuura.

221
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,180
When you tried to avoid the fence

222
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,680
that came falling on the road right above,

223
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,380
you slammed on the brakes and drifted slightly, didn't you?

224
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,580
Yeah. So what?

225
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,880
I see. You took advantage of the impact of drifting

226
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,080
and made the body go over the guard rail,

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,880
throwing it onto the road below.

228
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
You left the debris of the fence on the road

229
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,180
as a marker as to where to drift the car.

230
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,580
That way, you would be able to find the body on the way back.

231
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,780
Hold it.

232
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,580
But there are many sharp curves before passing that road!

233
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,280
If the dead body's not fastened to something,

234
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,380
it would fall way before that point!

235
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,080
Were there masking tape or ropes on Yasumi's body?

236
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,580
About that...

237
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,680
Come to think of it, her belt.

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,480
That is the same one that Yoko Okino was wearing the other day!

239
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,180
Something was on her belt!

240
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,480
But how could that have been used?

241
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
Didn't you notice?

242
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,080
The decoration on the tip of her belt,

243
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,480
only one edge was tied.

244
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,980
Yeah, I saw that too.

245
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,280
I thought it was a fashion of some kind.

246
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,180
Oh, right! I forgot to show you something.

247
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,280
Officer Takagi!

248
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,480
Will you please close the sunroof for now?

249
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,680
Oh, all right.

250
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,180
See! There's the blood streak I mentioned a while ago!

251
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,380
It's a little away from the edge, isn't it?

252
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,980
Why do you think it's that way?

253
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,280
It's probably because the sunroof was a little open

254
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,080
when the person killed Kazumi!

255
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,580
Why was the sunroof a little open?

256
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,080
What do you mean why?

257
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,780
I see!

258
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,280
If one edge of the belt was tied, then...

259
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,680
Exactly!

260
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,080
The killer pinched the tied part to the sunroof

261
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,280
and fixed Ms. Yasumi's body in place on top of the car!

262
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,180
After bending her body in half!

263
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,580
The killer left the sunroof a little open

264
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,380
so that he could carry out the murder smoothly.

265
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,680
The killer left it open because unless they did so,

266
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,980
after they hit Ms. Yasumi to death on top of the car,

267
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,280
they would've had to go down, open the sunroof,

268
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,980
then climb up again to stick the string between the sunroof

269
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,080
and finally come down again to close the sunroof.

270
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,180
Since there is only one button to open the sunroof by the driver's seat.

271
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,280
You did say a while ago that when you first passed by here,

272
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,580
you opened the sunroof and watched the fireworks,

273
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,180
but who opened it?

274
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,780
Of course, I did since I was driving the car.

275
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,480
Haruka asked me to open it so...

276
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,980
That was because...

277
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,380
I just wanted to do what was good last year, this year too.

278
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,880
I see. If so, it's not difficult to assume that

279
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,480
someone will ask to open the sunroof this year too.

280
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,180
Even if it is not so, since you're at the driver's seat,

281
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,980
you could secretly open it without anybody noticing it.

282
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,680
Hey.

283
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,980
You opened the sunroof

284
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,480
and removed the tied part that was stuck to the window

285
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,680
and let the corpse go free then you drifted the car on the road

286
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
where the piece of broken fence was,

287
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,580
and swing her body down on the road below.

288
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,280
In other words, the one who can work out this trick

289
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,780
is the one with skilled driving techniques like you

290
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,880
who used to belong to a car club!

291
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,780
You'd think so, right?

292
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,980
But, the fact is not so!

293
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,880
Actually, I thought so at first too.

294
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
But, I had forgotten that

295
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,080
this car had been going uphill

296
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,280
and this was just the place where the sunroof was opened!

297
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,980
But, after seeing the blood smeared vinyl sheet it dawned on me!

298
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,680
If the vinyl sheet is laid under the body of the corpse

299
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,280
and friction is decreased,

300
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
it's easy.

301
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,580
The minute the the sunroof is opened

302
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,080
because of the impact of the wind and the slope,

303
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,380
the dead body would slide off the top of the car!

304
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:07,580
Which means that any of you three could've committed the murder.

305
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,380
I'm very sorry to say this,

306
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,180
but I would like you all to come to the station with me.

307
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,280
You don't have to do that!

308
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,580
Because the killer has made a mistake wearing clothes!

309
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,080
Wearing clothes?

310
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,180
Will you three stand up and go out to the corridor?

311
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,380
Geez. I'll tell you.

312
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,780
So, what can you find out doing something like this?

313
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,080
What's the matter, Ayumi?

314
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,380
See, her belt...

315
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,080
Her belt is not through the belt loop of her jeans!

316
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,880
Then, don't tell me that...

317
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,580
You're the killer?

318
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,480
No! I was in a rush when coming from home.

319
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Ayumi, you took a picture of everyone, didn't you?

320
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,580
Yes.

321
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,080
If I remember it right, I think you took a rear view shot of her too,

322
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,780
Wait a second...

323
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,880
Here it is! This is the one!

324
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,980
But her belt is through the belt loop like it should be!

325
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,580
It was through the belt loop at first

326
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,180
and why isn't it now?

327
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,880
Well I took a shower in this camping car at sundown

328
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,380
so I may have done it then.

329
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,680
Is it necessary to remove your belt

330
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,780
when you take off your jeans?

331
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,580
It's because I changed into a different pair of jeans.

332
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,680
You've changed jeans.

333
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
Yes.

334
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
Could I have a look at it?

335
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,480
Yes.

336
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,880
It sure looks like the one you're wearing

337
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,580
is the same as the one in this picture

338
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,780
although you say you changed jeans.

339
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,580
Well, I guess so.

340
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,180
Then, I don't mean to be rude,

341
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,980
but can you please show it to me?

342
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,380
The jeans you wore before you changed.

343
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,480
Well...

344
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,580
You can't show it to him even if you wanted to, right?

345
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,880
It's probably the jeans that you were wearing when you hit Ms. Yasumi,

346
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,680
and you threw it away in the mountains

347
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,280
somewhere with the clothes you were wearing back then, right?

348
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,180
Because they were splattered with Ms. Yasumi's blood!

349
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,080
But she let us ride this car

350
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,580
when we went to go watch the fireworks!

351
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,680
Right!

352
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,180
Why would she want us to ride in the car

353
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,880
that she had the dead body on?

354
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,180
Rather, she had to make us ride the car!

355
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,180
If I followed this camping car with my car from behind,

356
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,080
I would see the dead body sliding off the camping car.

357
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,780
But...

358
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,680
you're so rich.

359
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,880
I'm not rich.

360
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
I'm an ordinary university student

361
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,180
with no special talent.

362
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,580
That's why unless I acted rich,

363
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,480
nobody would even look at me.

364
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,580
I really had a tough time.

365
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,880
I worked part-time with all my might

366
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,280
and even borrowed money to rent this expensive camping car

367
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,480
in order to bring everybody to the beach and the mountains.

368
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,180
But because they were the first friends I had,

369
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,680
so I did my best...

370
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,880
Yes. I thought they were my friends.

371
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,080
Until I heard what Yasumi said.

372
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,580
Didn't you know?

373
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,480
It's all just a bunch of lies

374
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,180
that she's from a rich family!

375
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,380
I could tell right off the bat that she wasn't.

376
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
So I followed her.

377
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,880
Sure enough, she was living in a rundown apartment!

378
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,180
Which means I was being deceived for four years?

379
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,980
Then why don't you tell her to stop lying?

380
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,180
You're her best friend, aren't you?

381
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,480
Yasumi.

382
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,980
Best friend?

383
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
All she means to me is money.

384
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,680
If not, do you think I could pretend that I didn't know

385
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,780
for four years?

386
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,580
It was really tough for me to keep from laughing though.

387
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,480
Besides, if I told her and she gets angry at me

388
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
demanding to get back all she dished out up to now,

389
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
what would I do?

390
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,280
I don't think she's that kind of girl.

391
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,380
Too bad, Reiji.

392
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,180
I guess you were sort of looking forward to getting rich, right?

393
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Yes. It's too bad.

394
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,880
I guess I'll bid her farewell as soon as we graduate.

395
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,580
Well, I guess I'll have her devote herself and money to me till then.

396
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,080
Dear Ms. Richie-Rich, Haruka!

397
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,080
I believed.

398
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,780
I believed that they were my best friends!

399
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,280
That's why you killed Yasumi

400
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,980
and tried to frame Reiji up as the killer.

401
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,480
Yes! I got angry at her just as she thought I would!

402
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,080
At that woman who had dared to step all over my feelings of friendship!

403
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,680
That's not being friends at all!

404
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,380
That's not being friends at all to begin with!

405
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,080
Yes, she's right.

406
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,180
It's no better than the vending machine of juice cans.

407
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,080
If you put money into the machine, it will quench your thirst,

408
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,580
but if you don't insert money, it won't give you anything.

409
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,180
You can't buy people's hearts with money.

410
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,380
Ai's final remark was splendid!

411
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,280
Yes, it made me feel good!

412
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,180
You sure can make good remarks when you want to, right, Haibara?

413
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,480
Not really.

414
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,280
It's some phrase I heard somebody else say.

415
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,680
I thought that's how it would normally be.

416
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,980
Back then, Ran refused Sonoko's invitation to go skiing with her.

417
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,380
When I asked her why,

418
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
she told me a bit depressed,

419
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,880
that she didn't have enough allowance that month.

420
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,080
I told her to have rich Sonoko pay her way too,

421
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,580
then she angrily looked at me and said...

422
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,680
I would never do such a thing

423
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,480
because I want to stay friends with Sonoko forever.

424
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,580
That's what she said.

425
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,680
That's why I felt that

426
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,880
their relationship with Haruka seemed kind of fake.

427
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,380
They seemed to be flattering her

428
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,280
only because she was rich.

429
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,180
But, you were really cool!

430
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,680
Ai...

431
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,980
It's okay. You can call me informally.

432
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,880
You want to call me informally, don't you?

433
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Really, Ai?

434
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
Then can...

435
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,280
We call you informally too.

436
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
No, the rest of you can't.

437
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,980
-Okay. -Okay.

438
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Next Conan Hint:

439
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
"Curry rice"

440
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,960
-Next episode... -After camping comes tennis.

441
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,460
After the tent comes the net.

442
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,180
After barbecue comes spicy curry.
