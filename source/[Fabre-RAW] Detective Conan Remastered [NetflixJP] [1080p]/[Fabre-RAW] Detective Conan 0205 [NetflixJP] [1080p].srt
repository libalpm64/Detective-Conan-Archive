1
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,840
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,540
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,040
Officers always busy at work.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Take time out between cases for love.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,190
There, that's a good boy.

9
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,790
Grow, grow huger

10
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,290
and leave the claws of flames behind.

11
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,290
Just once more.

12
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,690
Just once more and the eve will be over.

13
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,890
This rotten town will be lighted up with crimson flames.

14
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,590
And the beautiful carnival shall begin.

15
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,990
Ayumi?

16
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,090
-What are you doing? -Mother.

17
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,590
-Come on, let's go home. -Okay!

18
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,990
"Love Story At Headquarters 3 (Part 1)"

19
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,890
"Metropolitan Police Department"

20
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,990
I see.

21
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,390
And how did the eyes of the man?

22
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,890
Well... He had eyes like a fox.

23
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,390
It was like this!

24
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,490
His eyes were slanted.

25
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,990
Then maybe...

26
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,390
he looked like this?

27
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,390
His is completely different.

28
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,690
Really?

29
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,390
You're not a very good drawer, are you?

30
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,890
That's no better than a child's doodling.

31
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,390
Isn't there anyone who can draw better?

32
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,690
It can't be helped

33
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,990
because Mr. Tomogawa, the one in charge is out sick.

34
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,590
What?

35
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,290
Excuse me.

36
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,190
But, Ms. Sato.

37
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,490
Yes?

38
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,090
I don't think we can pass this sketch

39
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,390
around to the investigation officers.

40
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,590
Well, I guess it does have a sort of interesting touch to it.

41
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,890
So what, are you two going to sketch for me instead?

42
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,890
Well, I don't thinks so. I can't draw.

43
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,690
I only draw abstract.

44
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,690
Wait, Officer Shiratori!

45
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,690
Dirty rat.

46
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,390
Besides, we're not really sure

47
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,890
if the man she saw is really the arsonist yet.

48
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,190
What? Are you saying that Ayumi is lying?

49
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,290
Don't take us lightly because we're kids.

50
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,090
But it's not like you saw the guy actually cause the fire, is it?

51
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,390
-No doubt about it. -Huh?

52
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,890
He was wearing a leather jacket

53
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,090
despite this hot weather.

54
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,190
He had gloves on

55
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,890
and his pants smelled of kerosene

56
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,390
as he loitered around the back alley where the fire took place

57
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,490
and was grinning.

58
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,190
It would be more difficult

59
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,290
not to suspect him of being the arsonist.

60
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,690
Well?

61
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,390
-Right, Ayumi? -Yes!

62
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,490
All right. Let's head off to that back alley

63
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,390
and check the place out.

64
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,090
You're going to check the site of the fire?

65
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,990
I'll go with you.

66
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,690
Let me take you in my car.

67
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,090
Okay, but I have to stop over some place first.

68
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,690
It's on the way to the site, anyway.

69
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,690
What?

70
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,990
Stop by somewhere?

71
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,790
Today is a special day for me.

72
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,090
A special day?

73
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,390
Your birthday or something?

74
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,590
No.

75
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,090
The opposite.

76
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,590
The opposite?

77
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,490
I wonder where's she's stopping over?

78
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,590
A special day...

79
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,190
I see. Now I remember.

80
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,190
Today is Police Commissioner, Masayoshi Sato,

81
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,390
Ms. Sato's father's memorial.

82
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,790
The day that he died on duty.

83
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,090
What? Really?

84
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,390
Yes.

85
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,790
It was exactly 18 years ago today.

86
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,690
When he was going after a robber, at this intersection...

87
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,590
At this intersection?

88
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,490
Yes. He was run over by a truck this intersection.

89
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,590
Unfortunately, it was raining hard that day

90
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,090
so the ambulance arrived late.

91
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,890
Inspector Megure told me

92
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,290
that the Commissioner died in the ambulance

93
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,390
that Ms. Sato rode along in,

94
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,190
with his family watching over him.

95
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,790
If I remember correctly, the name of the case was...

96
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,990
-Shushiro. -What?

97
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,690
Right! It's Shushiro.

98
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,190
The officer who was run over by the truck

99
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,290
repeated that name over and over

100
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,890
towards the person hat fled from the scene.

101
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,990
Because of this mysterious name,

102
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,290
this case was name "The Shushiro Case".

103
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,390
And an all out investigation network

104
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,890
that saw no precedent was set up.

105
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,090
However, since the officer who was thought to have the key

106
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,990
to the case passed away,

107
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,790
the case remained stagnant

108
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,090
and expired 3 years ago.

109
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,990
That's what Pops told me.

110
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,990
Yeah. I've seen that case repeatedly on TV

111
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,990
so I know about it too.

112
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,890
That was close, real close.

113
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,690
It was a crime that was carefully thought out

114
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,790
that the only clue was the 10 second image of the robber

115
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,990
on the surveillance monitor of the bank that was robbed.

116
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,890
Nobody even knows how the officer who died duty

117
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,590
was able to specify the criminal.

118
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,290
The case was thrown into oblivion and is still unsolved.

119
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,690
But I had no idea

120
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,490
that the officer back then as Ms. Sato's father.

121
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,490
It can't be helped.

122
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,090
Although the name of the case

123
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,790
and the name of the criminal remain in the minds of people...

124
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,290
Nobody except police personnel...

125
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,290
could ever be expected to member the name of the officer

126
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,490
who died on duty In the case.

127
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,390
Ms. Sato...

128
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,090
Well, after all, we're not doing our job

129
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,590
because we want to be remembered.

130
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,190
But maybe the driver of the truck saw who the robber was?

131
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,790
The robber was wearing a long raincoat,

132
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,290
but we don't even know if the person was a man or woman.

133
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,690
Even in the picture taken by the surveillance camera

134
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,990
the robber was wearing a cap, sunglasses, a mask and coat.

135
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,990
But the name of the criminal was know, wasn't it?

136
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,690
That was Shushiro?

137
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,890
There was nobody by that name

138
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,790
that was capable committing the crime.

139
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,990
Well, I guess that case was bound to go unsolved

140
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,690
because all the police had to go on were three clues.

141
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,490
The picture left on the surveillance camera,

142
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,790
the fact that a raincoat was worn and the name Shushiro.

143
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,490
There were four.

144
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,390
The fourth clue was

145
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,390
written in my father's police I.D. memo book,

146
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,590
three mysterious letters written in Katakana.

147
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,490
"Kan-o".

148
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,990
Kan-o?

149
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,490
That's a first.

150
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,790
The police seemed to have kept it from being disclosed.

151
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,290
It was deduced that

152
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,890
the word was deeply involved with the case,

153
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,790
so my mother and I were repeatedly asked,

154
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,190
"Did you ever hear Masayoshi say this word?"

155
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,990
And?

156
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,390
I've never even heard him say it

157
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,290
and besides, I don't have any idea what it means either.

158
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,990
When I was a child, I used to glare at the three letters

159
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,790
and always thought

160
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,490
that if anyone ever appears and nabs "Shushiro",

161
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,590
I would grant that person's every wish!

162
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,090
-Huh? -Grant every...

163
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,590
Wish...

164
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,790
If I find out,

165
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,090
will you treat me to a thousand eel over rice bowls?

166
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,290
Yes, of course.

167
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,390
I'd like to live in the castle at Tropical Land.

168
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,590
I'd like a boarding pass to the International Space Station.

169
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,690
I'd like a brand name bag.

170
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,290
Could I have the ticket to the next World Cup Soccer game?

171
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,190
Yes.

172
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,690
How frightening. They're so realistic.

173
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,390
What is the matter with you two?

174
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,390
Oh, flowers...

175
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,490
Huh?

176
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,990
It's been a long time since I've seen you last!

177
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,090
Is it you, Miwako?

178
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,390
You've really grown to be a nice woman.

179
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,690
-Do you know each other? -Yes.

180
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,790
He used to be on the same high school baseball team as my father.

181
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,690
He is ace Mr. Hidero Saruwatari

182
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,790
who had was a battery team with my father.

183
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,590
How do you do?

184
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,390
He is Mr. Shuji Kano,

185
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,090
who was known for his strong arm and swift legs.

186
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,790
Hello.

187
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,590
He used to be the team's reliable main batter,

188
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,390
Mr. Mitsuo Inomata.

189
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,390
And she is the beautiful, Mrs. Choko Kandori,

190
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,590
who used to be their manager.

191
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,790
Oh, come on! I'm a 50 year old middle aged lady already.

192
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,190
What brings you all here today?

193
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,590
It's been some time since we've all seen each other,

194
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,390
so we've decided to get together for a drink.

195
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,090
But before we go, we came to say hello to

196
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,790
Sato who used be the captain of our team.

197
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,090
I see.

198
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,190
He sulks if we don't ask him to come along too.

199
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,590
We're going to the pub that we always go to.

200
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,090
Yes, Shiratori here.

201
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,690
Oh, Inspector Megure.

202
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,390
Huh? Now?

203
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,690
We are at 4-chome Haido-cho.

204
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,790
What?

205
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,690
A suspicious person who looks to be an arsonist was witnessed?

206
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,390
Right! The address is 6-chome Shinagawa.

207
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,990
The officer who was on patrol

208
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,590
was questioning him when he fled.

209
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,090
They're in the midst of pursuing him now.

210
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,790
He has long hair, is wearing an hat and a gray coat.

211
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,690
He seems to be near where you are now.

212
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,490
Leave the children to Officer Sato.

213
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,290
You and Takagi head for the site on the double.

214
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,390
So, that's the story.

215
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,890
-Let's go, Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

216
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,190
What's up? Hurry!

217
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,890
My police I.D. book...

218
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,690
My gun...

219
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,490
Oh, no!

220
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,790
Officer Takagi!

221
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,190
The handcuffs...

222
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,190
I left the handcuffs on the desk of the 1 section at the station.

223
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,790
Hey, hey.

224
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,990
We've got no time to go back and get it, you know.

225
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,190
Are you all right, Officer Takagi?

226
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,490
I'm okay.

227
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,390
If worse comes to worse, Officer Shiratori has his...

228
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,290
And besides, my fortune in the magazine,

229
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,990
it said today is a super lucky day for me.

230
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,390
I can do without handcuffs, he's only an arsonist.

231
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,290
Please be careful, dear.

232
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,590
Don't worry. According to today's fortune,

233
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,790
I'm supposed to be super lucky.

234
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,490
Huh? Father forgot to take the handcuffs.

235
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,590
What? My husband...

236
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,390
My husband was run over by a car?

237
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,690
Where is he now?

238
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,190
It's not right. Why?

239
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,290
Father is fighting for justice and yet...

240
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,590
He's fighting against the bad, and yet... Why?

241
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,890
You idiot.

242
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,990
The word "justice"...

243
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,090
The word "justice"...

244
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,290
Officer Sato?

245
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,890
Huh?

246
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,490
-Are you all right? -Yes.

247
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,190
We'll be on our way, then.

248
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,890
Please take care of the children!

249
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,090
Wait!

250
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,390
Please wait, Officer Takagi!

251
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,890
-Officer Takagi. -Yes?

252
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,390
These handcuffs sure are rusty.

253
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,790
If you don't have your handcuffs, take those.

254
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,590
Okay.

255
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,390
Those are my father's keepsake.

256
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,090
I broke my handcuffs during Mr. Higashida's case

257
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,790
so I was using those for a while.

258
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,790
They're just right as a lucky charm for you.

259
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,790
Charm...

260
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,590
I thought your father died on duty.

261
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,290
Just take them, okay?

262
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,990
Be careful, both of you.

263
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,290
-Wait, Officer Sato! -Officer Takagi.

264
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,890
Yes, sir?

265
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,490
Bye.

266
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,390
What's going on?

267
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,190
Why be armed with a gun when dealing with a mere arsonist?

268
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,290
Well, they're both officers

269
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,790
of the violent crime investigation section.

270
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,490
I don't see why they have to go after the arsonist.

271
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,090
A stabbed body was found,

272
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,890
near the fourth site of the fire set by the arsonist.

273
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,490
We don't have proof,

274
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,790
but the victim... most likely witnessed the crime

275
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,090
or tried to stop the arsonist and was stabbed.

276
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,990
That's what we suspect.

277
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,790
So, I want you all to stay close to me.

278
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,290
Okay...

279
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,820
"Shinagawa Station"

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Inspector, Shiratori here.

281
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,220
We just caught the suspicious man

282
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,020
who was on the run at Shinagawa Station.

283
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,120
No, I'm not the one!

284
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,020
However, Inspector...

285
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
He insists that he is not the arsonist,

286
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,920
but just a thief.

287
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,420
I get it! So that's what it was!

288
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,220
I've solved the mystery!

289
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Today is my lucky day after all.

290
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,920
Okay, I'm going to call Officer Sato...

291
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,220
Officer Takagi.

292
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,920
Yes, sir?

293
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,020
Officer Takagi.

294
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Where are you calling?

295
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,820
Well... Nowhere, nowhere special.

296
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,220
I'm going to the men's room.

297
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,820
Where is it?

298
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,220
Yes, yes! This is the one!

299
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,520
I was buying this toy of Masked Yaiba

300
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,720
when a weird man came out of there.

301
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes! Sato here.

302
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,020
Oh, Officer Takagi. So, what with the suspicious man?

303
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,820
What?

304
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
You've figured out the criminal of 18 years ago?

305
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Yes. According to my deductions, most likely...

306
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,020
Listen to this. He was there.

307
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,920
Today, among the people that we met...

308
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,820
That person...

309
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,020
What is it, Officer Shiratori?

310
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,020
Officer Takagi, you are acting strange.

311
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,320
Come off it. Give me a break!

312
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,520
Yes... That's right!

313
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,320
I've figured everything out.

314
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,620
The true meaning of Shushiro too.

315
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,420
The secret of "kan-o" as well.

316
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,120
Now I know why your father

317
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,420
found out and was able to specify the killer.

318
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,020
Although the case has already expired...

319
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,020
And? Who is it? Who is the killer?

320
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,420
The killer is...

321
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,220
Hey, Officer Takagi?

322
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,720
Officer Takagi!

323
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,420
Officer Takagi...

324
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,620
What's wrong? Answer me!

325
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,020
Officer Takagi! Answer me!

326
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,620
Officer Takagi...

327
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,820
Hello?

328
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,720
Officer Takagi...

329
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,520
Okay, please do.

330
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,220
Yes, Shiratori here.

331
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,120
Oh, Officer Sato.

332
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,620
The suspect was just taken to the Shinagawa Police Station.

333
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,920
What? Officer Takagi?

334
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,820
Yes. I was with him, just 4 to 5 minutes ago.

335
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,520
Then the place and time where you last saw him...

336
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Call headquarters and give the central command room the info!

337
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,020
-What? -Officer Takagi's been attacked by someone!

338
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,320
Just a while ago while he was talking to me on the cell phone!

339
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,520
The attacker may be the arsonist that we're after

340
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,820
so please be careful!

341
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,520
Officer Takagi was attacked

342
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,220
just when he was about to tell you

343
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,420
who the killer of 18 years ago was, right?

344
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,320
Then the killer is...

345
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,820
No, because that case expired 3 years ago

346
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,020
and we can't even be sure if Officer Takagi's deduction is right.

347
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,920
You know the four that we met at sundown...

348
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
They were saying they were going to drink

349
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,420
at the pub they usually go to.

350
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,920
Where is it?

351
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,720
Where...

352
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,420
The name of the pub is "Nanamagari".

353
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,320
It's located...

354
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,920
in front of Shinagawa Station...

355
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,720
If Officer Takagi said that he saw the killer of 18 years ago

356
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,020
among the four that we met,

357
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
then somebody within that group

358
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,720
who was also in front of Shinagawa Station

359
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,520
could've coincidentally heard his conversation with you.

360
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
The killer may have attacked Officer Takagi

361
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,420
to shut him up, right?

362
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,520
I'm going to head off to Shinagawa Station.

363
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
So you all go home by train

364
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,820
and come to headquarters again tomorrow.

365
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,620
What?

366
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,820
But the one who attacked Officer Takagi

367
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,120
may also be the arsonist, right?

368
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,920
Then, I don't see why you're not taking Ms. Yoshida's

369
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,520
who's the only one who witness the criminal.

370
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,820
-But... -I'll do my best!

371
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,220
-Me, too! -I'll cooperate, too!

372
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,020
Gosh.

373
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,520
From headquarters to calling all stations.

374
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,920
Officers in the Shinagawa area.

375
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,020
The place is in the vicinity of Shinagawa Station.

376
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,120
Details are one officer whose whereabouts

377
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,320
seems to have been struck by someone or wounded.

378
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,620
Investigate on the double and report investigation results!

379
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,020
From headquarters to calling all stations.

380
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,620
Officers in the Shinagawa area.

381
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,820
The place is in the vicinity of Shinagawa Station.

382
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,520
It... it can't be...

383
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,320
To think that the killer is among the four...

384
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,120
The one that killed my father is among the four...

385
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,420
It's not true, right, father?

386
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,460
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,180
"Romaji (Roman letters)"

388
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,140
In the next episode, the case is solved.

389
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,280
I'm Takagi, I'm a police officer!

390
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,400
I thought you were done for?

391
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,420
Oh, right!
I thought you were done for?

392
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,560
Oh, right!
