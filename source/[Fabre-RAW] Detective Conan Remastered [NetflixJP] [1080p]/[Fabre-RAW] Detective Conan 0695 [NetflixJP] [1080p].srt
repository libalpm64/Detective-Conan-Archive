1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:05,144
Mr. Mouri, it was raining really bad this morning,

2
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:06,444
but didn't you get wet?

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:07,987
No.

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:09,344
I see.

5
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:12,644
But what a large vineyard you have.

6
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,995
Is this vineyard all for your winery, Yurika?

7
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:19,544
Yes, I inherited it from my late father.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,744
And I am now co-managing the Suwayama Winery

9
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:29,244
together with my husband who was studying agriculture

10
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:32,011
and friend, Mr. Mizumachi.

11
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,144
I see.

12
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:36,644
"Yurika Suwayama (28)" -I'm not too good about vineyards and all,

13
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:39,144
"Joint manager of a winery" -so I depend on the two, you see.

14
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:43,044
I'm looking forward to seeing the wine!

15
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,744
Don't over drink, Pops.

16
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:48,644
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

17
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:50,544
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

18
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:52,031
An incident occurs at the winery.

19
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:54,033
An alibi trick at the vineyard.

20
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,744
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:57,744
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:00,344
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,591
"A Rose in a Vineyard".

24
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,161
This is very elegant tasting wine!

25
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,491
To comment that this wine is elegant...

26
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:07,891
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?

27
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,169
Well, I guess so

28
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,591
because I'm quite picky when it comes to wine.

29
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:16,491
You just said what came to mind at random, right?

30
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:20,179
"Akihiro Yamaguchi (41)" -I run several restaurants in Tokyo.

31
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,691
"Restaurant manager" -My name is Akihiro Yamaguchi.

32
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,291
I am in love with Suwayama wine.

33
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,187
So, I'm scheduled to sign a contract with them today.

34
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,591
I see!

35
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:34,591
It's true that this wine is different from other wines.

36
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:39,191
On top of that, the owner, Yurika, also a very beautiful lady.

37
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,391
I'm sorry, Mr. Yamaguchi.

38
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:42,691
What seems to be the matter?

39
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:47,591
I can't seem to find Kengo who has the contract.

40
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,991
I think we'll find it right away though.

41
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,491
Again?

42
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,213
Yes. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,217
Her husband, Kengo,

44
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,791
is a professor type and not easy to get along with,

45
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,791
and is also too absorbed in making wine.

46
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,691
When I saw him previously...

47
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,991
"Kengo Suwayama (33), Yurika's husband" -I'm not going to sign a contract

48
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:12,231
"An agriculturist" -that's bound to lower the taste of Suwayama wine!

49
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:16,991
Well, I guess it's his adherence to his ways that makes this Suwayama wine.

50
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,091
But, the contract this time is not a bad one.

51
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:23,291
I feel sorry for Yurika.

52
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,691
Mr. Mizumachi.

53
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,691
"Tomoaki Mizumachi (34), Joint owner of the winery" -Did you see Kengo?

54
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,891
No. I haven't seen him since I saw him this morning.

55
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,253
"Shuji Takashina (28), Employee at the winery" -Maybe he's hiding

56
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,255
because he doesn't want to see Mr. Yamaguchi?

57
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:39,391
Maybe he's not convinced after all.

58
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,191
Don't worry, Yurika.

59
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,891
Although he hasn't shown up,

60
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,291
it seems Kengo has come to agree with the contract.

61
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,265
Huh?

62
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:48,267
See, take a look at this.

63
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,269
I found it on the desk of the barn.

64
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,891
So Kengo signed the contract already!

65
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,691
I'm happy for you.

66
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,791
Mr. Yamaguchi, the contract's been found.

67
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,591
This completes the contract!

68
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:06,291
I'm counting on you, Mr. Yamaguchi.

69
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,287
Yurika, Mr. Mizumachi,

70
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,991
we're going to be partners from now on,

71
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,991
so please discuss what you have to anytime with me.

72
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,391
We will.

73
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,891
I wonder where Kengo disappeared to though.

74
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:22,091
I will go look for Kengo at the barn on the south vineyard.

75
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,991
Mr. Mizumachi,

76
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,291
could you take Mr. Mouri and his party

77
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,291
on a tour of our vineyard for me in the meantime?

78
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,391
In the vineyard to the south over there is the Cabernet Sauvignon

79
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:37,191
and in the vineyard to the north, are the Pinot Noir grapes.

80
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,591
The south is of red clay soil,

81
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,191
whereas the north is of sand and gravel soil.

82
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,323
Although in the same vineyard, the type of soil is different.

83
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:48,327
So, we are growing different types of grapes that match the soil.

84
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,329
Is that how it works?

85
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,591
There's a fog over the vineyard and it looks beautiful.

86
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:56,891
That's not fog, but natural insecticide.

87
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:00,591
It is sprayed every day between the hours of 13:00 to 16:00.

88
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,341
It's about ending time now.

89
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:05,691
You're also growing roses?

90
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,691
No, these roses aren't for viewing

91
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,791
but rather to keep pests away.

92
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,791
Of course, it's not that the roses keep the pests away, though.

93
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,357
The roses are weaker than the grapes when it comes to pests and illnesses.

94
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,991
So, they wither before the grapes.

95
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:22,891
When the roses wither,

96
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,991
it means that danger is closing in on the vineyards, then.

97
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,991
Hey, do you grow different types of roses, depending on the vineyard?

98
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,191
No, they're the same type.

99
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:36,091
But, the colors of the roses are different.

100
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:39,791
That's not because the type of roses is different.

101
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,891
Hey, Yurika!

102
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,991
Did you find your husband?

103
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,691
No.

104
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,191
Since he's nowhere in sight,

105
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,389
I was thinking of going to look for him

106
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,191
in the barrel cellar that's in the north vineyard from now.

107
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:54,391
Barrel cellar?

108
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:59,791
Yes, wine that is ageing before bottling is there.

109
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,191
When you say ageing, does that mean

110
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:05,391
that you get to drink wine that is not aged?

111
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,491
I would really like to go there with you!

112
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,691
At all costs, Yurika!

113
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,591
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

114
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,791
Okay, shall we all go then?

115
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,191
Thank you!

116
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,391
This is...

117
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,191
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,891
This is homicide.

119
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,491
After tying his arms and legs,

120
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,491
his neck was hung using this stake.

121
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,459
Ridiculous! It can't be.

122
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,461
He couldn't be dead.

123
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,991
Hey! What do you mean by he couldn't be dead?

124
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,475
Detective Momoi!

125
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,479
The estimated time of death of the victim has been determined.

126
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,191
"Detective Momoi (32)" -It was around 13:30 to 14:30 today.

127
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:24,483
"of Yamanashi Prefectural Police Department" -I see.

128
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,191
What were you doing at that time?

129
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,191
I was working alone at the barn in the south vineyard

130
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:33,191
under order of Yurika.

131
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,493
Which means that

132
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:38,497
there is no one who can verify your alibi for you?

133
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,499
Hey, please wait!

134
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:44,191
I was asked by Yurika to confine Kengo in here and that's all I did!

135
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,891
I did tie him, but I didn't kill him!

136
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,091
Please believe me!

137
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:50,509
I didn't ask him to do such a thing!

138
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,511
Why you... Yurika...

139
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,391
Yurika.

140
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:56,515
Will you please give me your alibi during that time while we're at it?

141
00:08:56,515 --> 00:09:01,091
I, Kogoro Mouri will guarantee Yurika's alibi!

142
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:02,521
Today at 13:30,

143
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,525
she came to pick us up at the station.

144
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,891
And we arrived at the winery about 14:30.

145
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,991
After that, Yurika was with us right through.

146
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,791
I see.

147
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,191
Come to think of it, at about 15:30,

148
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,191
I headed for the barn in the south vineyard to search for Kengo.

149
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,545
Well, that has nothing to do with the time of death,

150
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,091
so that's no problem.

151
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:32,091
And we met Yurika again

152
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:33,891
at around a bit pass 16:00.

153
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,991
At this barrel cellar in the north vineyard,

154
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:39,991
we found the corpse at 16:30.

155
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:41,491
I see.

156
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,891
And, you two from around 13:00 till now

157
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:48,091
were in the winery facility? Is that correct?

158
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,691
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:51,691
I...

160
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,891
Early this morning, in the rain,

161
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:58,291
I saw Kengo and Mr. Mizumachi walking towards the barrel cellar.

162
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,491
By the way,

163
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:04,583
how many of you have the key to the barrel cellar?

164
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,291
Me, Mr. Mizumachi and Kengo.

165
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,791
And, Yurika also has one.

166
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,591
The victim's key was in his pocket.

167
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,593
And,

168
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,191
the lock of the barrel cellar was locked.

169
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:20,599
In other words, the culprit is someone who has the key

170
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:25,891
and moreover, has no alibi during the time of the death of the victim.

171
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,791
Officer,

172
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,091
I really can't understand.

173
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,291
Hey, you!

174
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,791
Why did the culprit go out of the way

175
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,391
to take Kengo's body over to the wall?

176
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,991
Huh, take the corpse over?

177
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,291
Yep. Because take a look at that.

178
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,191
The two black lines

179
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:45,991
are traces of shoe marks scraping along the floor, right?

180
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:50,291
It's true that it matches the toes of the victim.

181
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,631
If the tip of his shoes were scraped,

182
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,491
that means that Kengo was lying face down.

183
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:59,791
Besides, those lines are almost in one straight line, aren't they?

184
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,291
Which means that he didn't put up a fight.

185
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,191
In other words, it means that he was already dead by then.

186
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,691
I see.

187
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:11,391
That's why such strange marks are left on his neck.

188
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,191
The traces of the strangulation mark

189
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,591
lead from the bottom of his throat to the base of his neck.

190
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,191
Means that the corpse was lying on his stomach

191
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:23,791
and the culprit strangled the victim from behind.

192
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,091
I see.

193
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,791
But why did the culprit after killing the victim,

194
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,991
hang him from the wall?

195
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,673
Huh? Why is the way the rope is tied different?

196
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,891
This knot is just a plain square knot,

197
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:42,091
but the rope that tied Kengo's arm and legs

198
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,891
are two half hitched.

199
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,491
Two half hitches?

200
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:50,391
I saw Mr. Mizumachi tying a string in the vineyard a while ago.

201
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:53,691
Two half hitch tying is difficult to loosen,

202
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,191
so it is used in agriculture

203
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:57,791
and is a special way of making a knot.

204
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,491
True! The knots are different.

205
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:02,701
It's strange.

206
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,991
Why did the culprit tie a square knot

207
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,191
that may loosen up only on this side?

208
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,091
If Mr. Mizumachi were the culprit,

209
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:13,991
he would probably tie it so that the rope used as the murder weapon

210
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,391
would not loosen up.

211
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,291
Maybe the person who tied his arms and legs

212
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,591
and the person who tied the rope around his neck

213
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,191
are different people?

214
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:25,191
But, the only person here that doesn't have an alibi

215
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,291
is Mr. Mizumachi alone.

216
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,727
Exactly.

217
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,191
Everyone except Mr. Mizumachi has an alibi.

218
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,491
Oh no, there's mud on!

219
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,791
I love these shoes and yet...

220
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,291
I see.

221
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,391
Mud!

222
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,591
I see.

223
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,091
That person created an alibi with this!

224
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,225
Are you all right, Yurika?

225
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,325
I'm sure that Mr. Mizumachi did what he did

226
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,925
through his consideration for me.

227
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:11,325
Shipping out 800 bottles a year,

228
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,771
you must be kidding!

229
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:17,325
We could never make that amount with our vineyard alone!

230
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,125
If we stop organic farming,

231
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,525
we could yield more grapes.

232
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:22,781
And if that's not enough,

233
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,825
we can buy grapes from other vineyards.

234
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:27,625
If we stop organic farming

235
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,225
or mix different grapes with ours,

236
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:33,125
the quality of Suwayama wine will deteriorate!

237
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,793
Management is tough,

238
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,025
so we've got no choice.

239
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,325
We're getting nowhere!

240
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:44,803
I'm sure that in order to settle the contract today, he...

241
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,625
So, the motive's been determined.

242
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,025
He has no alibi when the crime was committed,

243
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:53,525
so I guess there's no doubt that Mizumachi is the culprit.

244
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,625
Excuse me...

245
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,125
Detective Momoi.

246
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,425
Please don't arrest Mr. Mizumachi just yet.

247
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:13,425
Huh?

248
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,833
Why?

249
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,225
I've figured out everything just now.

250
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,825
I've been mistaken.

251
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,841
The culprit is not Mr. Mizumachi,

252
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,625
but another person.

253
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,845
Don't tell me that this is the famous...

254
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:29,225
The one who almost 100% solves all cases,

255
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,125
the Sleeping Kogoro?

256
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,125
Mr. Mouri, who on earth is the culprit?

257
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,925
There was a pitfall to this case.

258
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,725
A pitfall?

259
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:44,863
The victim was killed between 13:30 and 14:30.

260
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:47,425
The people with alibis during this time

261
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,625
are inevitably knocked off the list of suspects.

262
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,525
Yes, that's the procedure of investigation.

263
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,425
But, even if the culprit is not there,

264
00:14:56,425 --> 00:15:01,225
if it were possible to kill the victim at a convenient time, what then?

265
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,883
After Mr. Mizumachi tied the victim up

266
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,725
and confined him in the barrel cellar,

267
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:11,325
the culprit went there in turn

268
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,825
and rigged a certain trick on the victim

269
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,925
and killed him.

270
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,025
Detective Momoi.

271
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:22,901
I would like you to help me to make explaining this easier.

272
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,025
Yes, sir.

273
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,225
I would like to replay

274
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,025
the circumstances that the victim was under before he died.

275
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,925
First, please lay on your stomach on the floor.

276
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,225
Like this?

277
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,925
Please imagine that your arms and legs are tied,

278
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,925
and lurch your back far behind.

279
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:43,425
This position is tough!

280
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,923
The greatest mystery

281
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,925
were the number of strangulation marks that were found on the victim.

282
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,929
The reason for that is this.

283
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:57,225
The culprit lurched the body of the victim backwards,

284
00:15:57,225 --> 00:16:00,939
and tied his neck and ankles with one rope.

285
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,125
Huh?

286
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:06,525
Then the victim in order not to choke his own neck,

287
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:08,947
has to keep on lurching his body backwards.

288
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,525
As a result,

289
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:13,225
a lot of strangulation marks were left on his neck.

290
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,725
Oh, no!

291
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,825
The knot of the rope that was hooked onto the stake on the wall,

292
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:21,225
and the knot of the rope that was tied to his arms and legs

293
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:23,225
were different because of this.

294
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,725
I see!

295
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,825
The bruise of him being choked from behind was left

296
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:32,125
because the rope that was tied to the victim's legs

297
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,625
was pulling his neck.

298
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,975
But, why did the culprit carry out such a trick?

299
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,977
As I have mentioned earlier,

300
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,325
it was to establish an alibi.

301
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,981
Doing it this way,

302
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:47,425
the culprit could buy time until the victim gets exhausted and dies.

303
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:50,525
What a ruthless thing to do just to establish an alibi.

304
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:54,025
After establishing an alibi during the time of the death of the victim,

305
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:57,525
the culprit returns to the barrel cellar again

306
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:00,725
and unties the rope that was tied around the neck and the ankles

307
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:03,001
in order to hide evidence of the trick.

308
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:07,625
Finally, the corpse was hung by the wall.

309
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,325
The only person who could've done this is...

310
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,525
Yurika,

311
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:16,125
you're the one who killed Kengo!

312
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:21,025
Don't be ridiculous!

313
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:25,023
You left the winery at around 15:30

314
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,025
saying that you were going to look for the victim, didn't you?

315
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,725
Back then, I went to the barn in the south vineyard.

316
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:33,031
I didn't come to this barrel cellar.

317
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,525
No, that's a lie.

318
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:39,425
Today you didn't go to the south vineyard, not even once.

319
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,425
Huh?

320
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:44,125
Cabernet Sauvignon grapes that favor red clay soil

321
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,725
is grown in the south vineyard.

322
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,525
The soil of the south vineyard

323
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:53,325
was muddy rain in the morning.

324
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:56,225
Damp red clay soil sticks easily,

325
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,825
so on Mr. Mizumachi's shoes

326
00:17:57,825 --> 00:18:00,525
who was working in the barn of the south vineyard,

327
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:04,025
red clay soil unique to the south vineyard was found.

328
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:09,525
On the other hand, no red soil was found on your shoes or hem.

329
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,825
That's...

330
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,225
That's not proof of anything!

331
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,725
Mizumachi's the one who killed my husband!

332
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,825
No, it's not.

333
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:22,625
It's true that Mr. Mizumachi confined Kengo here.

334
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,083
But, he didn't kill him.

335
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,725
How can you be so sure?

336
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:28,525
I sure can!

337
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:33,091
Because Mr. Mizumachi never came back to this barrel cellar.

338
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,725
How do you know?

339
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:40,825
The victim died between 13:30 and 14:30.

340
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:45,925
Mr. Mizumachi from 15:30 was walking through the vineyard with us.

341
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,525
So, the only time he could've rigged something up

342
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:54,225
would've been limited to between 13:30 to 15:30!

343
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:56,725
But just at that time...

344
00:18:56,725 --> 00:19:00,025
Yes, between 13:00 to 16:00,

345
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:02,225
in the north vineyard where the barrel cellar is,

346
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,625
a natural pesticide, wood vinegar was bring sprayed.

347
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,925
Conan!

348
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,025
Yes.

349
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:10,925
Wood vinegar is an acid liquid that is made from

350
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,725
the ashes of wood that is burned.

351
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:15,125
This is blue on the litmus paper.

352
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,137
If the color turns to pink, it is acidy.

353
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,525
There's no change!

354
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,225
There isn't any acidy wood vinegar on Mr. Mizumachi's clothes.

355
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,925
True! Which means that...

356
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:28,125
That's right,

357
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:33,151
it means that he didn't go to the north vineyard at that time.

358
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,825
But, Yurika,

359
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,925
you have wood vinegar on your body.

360
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:40,025
Where do you have such proof?

361
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,725
Your rose hair clip.

362
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,163
Hair clip?

363
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,525
It was a pretty silver color in the day time,

364
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,825
but now it's oxidized and blackened.

365
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:56,425
Silver craft turns black when sprinkled with acid liquid!

366
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:58,425
This is blackened

367
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,525
because when I went to look for Kengo in the barn,

368
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:03,525
I was sprayed with wood vinegar at the south vineyard!

369
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:06,025
That's not possible.

370
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,225
Look at the roses outside.

371
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,625
The same type of roses are grown

372
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,193
and yet, the roses that are planted in the south vineyard...

373
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,925
are yellow.

374
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,197
The colors of the roses are different

375
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,325
because what was sprinkled on the vineyards was different.

376
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:26,225
"Wood vinegar" -In the north vineyard, acid wood vinegar was sprayed.

377
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,925
"Alkaline Bourdeaux" -While in the south vineyard,

378
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:31,209
alkaline Bourdeaux mixture was sprayed.

379
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,211
Like the litmus paper,

380
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,213
yellow roses turn up with a reddish tint

381
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:38,825
when constantly in contact with acid liquid.

382
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:45,525
If you were really walking through the south vineyard,

383
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,925
your silver hair clip wouldn't be discolored.

384
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:53,625
What's this?

385
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,225
To think that something like this would serve as proof...

386
00:20:57,225 --> 00:21:01,525
Yes, that's right. I killed Kengo.

387
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,625
Yurika...

388
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,725
Yurika, you did something like this to sign a contract with the restaurant?

389
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,925
I didn't do it just for the money.

390
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,725
Kengo's to blame!

391
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:16,325
I understand, Yurika.

392
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:21,259
Let's get a divorce.

393
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,263
If the quality of Suwayama wine is going to deteriorate,

394
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:27,265
I'm leaving.

395
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,825
Why?

396
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:33,271
You don't have any understanding whatsoever about wine.

397
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,275
It was my mistake for marrying a woman like you.

398
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,625
I couldn't forgive him

399
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,283
after he despised me

400
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,925
and the nerve of him to choose wine instead of me.

401
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:50,725
Who cares what kind of grapes are used!

402
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:54,025
Who cares about wine!

403
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:20,525
"Mouri Detective Agency"

404
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:24,425
You already drank all the wine

405
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,125
they gave you as a token of their thanks, Dad?

406
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:30,625
That's the vintage wine that Mr. Yamaguchi was complimenting, right?

407
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,391
Then, if we let it age for several years...

408
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,393
It would've gotten more delicious.

409
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,525
No more wine for me.

410
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,825
No matter how long Pops ages,

411
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:46,025
he'll never mature.

412
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,926
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,320
"Brick".

414
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,411
Dad, don't get drunk and go inside the flower garden!

415
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:54,840
Huh? I'm the star in the next episode?

416
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,120
Just what're you talking about?
