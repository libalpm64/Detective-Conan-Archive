1
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:04,117
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:05,817
After the tears are "Welcoming Cats".

3
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:07,717
Welcoming cats also welcome crime?

4
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,617
Which paw is raised? Left, right

5
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:10,717
or both?

6
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:12,217
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:13,717
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:15,817
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:08,111
Hey! Don't you dare look up.

10
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:09,711
I'll kill you if you do!

11
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,011
I know.

12
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,811
Just hurry up, will you?

13
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:13,911
Why?

14
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:17,611
Why do I have to do something like this when I just happened to walk by?

15
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,711
Don't worry, come on over here.

16
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,611
Just a little more and I can reach him.

17
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,411
I mean you're really smaller than you should be, Conan.

18
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,211
Pardon me.

19
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:35,111
Thanks to who.

20
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,311
Do you know who this kitten belongs to?

21
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,311
Nope.

22
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,211
Do you know who this kitten belongs to?

23
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,511
Cha-cha!

24
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,111
Where were you, Cha-cha?

25
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:56,711
Excuse me.

26
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:00,111
"Tamotsu Ishigami(35)" -It's my cat.

27
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:01,611
He's been missing from just some time ago,

28
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:03,111
and I've been looking for him.

29
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,811
He was in the park.

30
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,211
He seems to have hurt his right paw

31
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,211
and is bleeding a bit.

32
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,411
You treated him?

33
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,211
-Thank you. -No problem.

34
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,611
As a token of my appreciation,

35
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,111
why don't you have something cold to drink at my shop?

36
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,511
Although there's one boisterous customer inside now.

37
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,011
Please come in!

38
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,611
There! There! Go for it!

39
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,611
Whip! Whip! Whip him.

40
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,511
Go!

41
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,611
My goodness.

42
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:36,311
"Office Kanemaru"

43
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,511
Master!

44
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:42,211
Ishigami... Bad news! Please come quickly!

45
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:45,211
"Kanemaru Office"

46
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,711
"Cha-cha Coffee Shop"

47
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:58,011
Mr. Kanemaru!

48
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:13,611
"Welcoming Cat from Right to Left"

49
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:20,111
Master, coffee please.

50
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,611
May I have a second serving?

51
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,911
Inspector Megure!

52
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,611
Why did inspector...

53
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,411
I wonder what it is?

54
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,911
Inspector.

55
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,911
You again?

56
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,511
Well, I saw police cars while I was taking a walk

57
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,711
and I thought that I should show up again so...

58
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:50,711
And why are you here?

59
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,011
Oh, never mind.

60
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,011
Do we have a case here?

61
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,611
Yep, the president of this company...

62
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,011
Kanemaru Office?

63
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:02,911
What do they do here?

64
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:05,211
Although it sounds like some prestigious company,

65
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:07,811
it's just another money-lending business.

66
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:09,011
He's the president of the company but the fact is,

67
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,611
there are no other employees, and he runs this place alone.

68
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,811
What's the victim's name and what about his family?

69
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,311
He's Mr. Kenzo Kanemaru, age 65.

70
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,111
He's single and has no family.

71
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,511
The coroner says that

72
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:23,211
the cause of death is a deadly blow to his head with a hard object.

73
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:29,111
He was probably hit on the head with one of those welcoming cats there.

74
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,811
Talk about a lot of cats.

75
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:35,211
The debris of the cracked cat seems to be scattered around the dead body.

76
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,211
The murder weapon is a welcoming cat?

77
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,511
And what's the estimated time of death?

78
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:42,711
Yes, sir, just several hours ago

79
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:45,211
between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.

80
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,811
Who is he?

81
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,811
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

82
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,711
"Fumie Imaoka (65)" -And she's Ms. Fumie Imaoka,

83
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:53,211
the one who found him.

84
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,311
She is a contract worker

85
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,811
who comes once a week to clean the place.

86
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,511
She came here today as usual,

87
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:01,611
at around 1:30 p.m.

88
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,111
Just who do you think you're making the report to?

89
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:12,011
I'm sorry, I got carried away...

90
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:15,411
The safe seems to have been ransacked.

91
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,811
Inspector Megure,

92
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,311
there's approximately 1 million yen in it,

93
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,711
that hasn't been touched.

94
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,711
I see.

95
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:32,511
Inspector! The one who found the dead body, that is, the killer.

96
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,511
Isn't this how the theory goes?

97
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:36,911
Ms. Imaoka...

98
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,911
has a debt of about 300,000 yen.

99
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:41,311
He probably severely demanded payment of her

100
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:44,411
and because of the pressure ended up hitting him.

101
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:47,711
A very common pattern indeed, yes.

102
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,111
Hey, Mr. Detective!

103
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:51,011
You aren't suspecting me, aren't you?

104
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,611
It's true that I borrowed money!

105
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,711
300,000 yen.

106
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:57,211
Moreover, he told me to come clean this place in place of paying him interest.

107
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,211
And it's true that I'm angry.

108
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,511
But, that doesn't mean that!

109
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:03,211
Calm down. Let's not get so upset.

110
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,311
-Inspector! -What is it?

111
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,911
It's something that was on the desk of the president's room next door.

112
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,611
Please take a look at it.

113
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:11,411
It's a daily dated notebook.

114
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:15,311
September 3rd, 12:30p.m., Chika Murai.

115
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,711
In other words, today,

116
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,411
I think it would be safe to say that

117
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:22,011
the victim was scheduled to meet this woman.

118
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,911
About that,

119
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,711
the Master of the coffee shop on the opposite side of the street

120
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,911
says that at about 12:30 p.m.

121
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,411
he saw a young woman come into this office.

122
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,911
A young woman?

123
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,611
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

124
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:39,611
-And, what did she look like? -Yes.

125
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:46,211
She had a brand name bag and wore expensive brand clothes, too.

126
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:49,611
"Chika Murai(22)" -She looked to be a flashy type of woman.

127
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:54,711
I think it was about 10 minutes later.

128
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,411
She came here about 12:30 p.m.

129
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,411
and left at about 12:40 p.m.

130
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:04,111
Right on the bull's eye of the estimated time of death.

131
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:08,111
Yes, so we think she may have information regarding the incident

132
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:10,911
and have dispatched a look out for her throughout this jurisdiction.

133
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,111
Yes, I see. I got it.

134
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:31,611
Bring her over so we can have her identified.

135
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,411
A woman who looks to be Ms. Chika has been taken into custody.

136
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,411
They're headed this way.

137
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,511
Is that right?

138
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:41,411
The victim Mr. Kanemaru sure has a strange hobby,

139
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,611
collecting so many welcome cats.

140
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:47,611
No, it's not his hobby. It's just plain greed.

141
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,411
He's collecting them only because he wants money.

142
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:51,911
He collected them out of greed?

143
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,111
As you can see, all the cats here

144
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,911
have their right paws raised.

145
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,211
True.

146
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,211
Since I've seen these cats with left their left paws raised too,

147
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,411
in order to satisfy my curiosity

148
00:09:00,411 --> 00:09:02,411
I personally asked him why.

149
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,211
He told me that cats with their left paw raised beckon people,

150
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,711
while ones with their right paws raised beckon money.

151
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,111
Please beckon money to me.

152
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,711
Never mind about beckoning people.

153
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,911
I don't want to waste money on having to serve them tea.

154
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:17,411
I mean he was nothing but a super miser.

155
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:21,111
I see, so that's the story on cats with their right paws raised.

156
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:24,011
Did you know that they beckon money?

157
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,411
No.

158
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:29,511
But even though I won't have to come here and clean anymore,

159
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,411
I feel like I'll kind of miss it.

160
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,211
Cleaning?

161
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:48,911
Excuse me, ma'am.

162
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:50,811
Did Mr. Kanemaru ever vacuum

163
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,311
the room himself?

164
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,911
Nope.

165
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,411
He used to say that it was a waste of electricity

166
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:59,511
so I came and did it once a week.

167
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:05,811
Hey, don't you go loitering around and get in the way of the investigation.

168
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:06,811
Alright.

169
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,811
Trash bag?

170
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,411
No, I didn't throw it away.

171
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,211
I guess it's strange because I know that Mr. Kanemaru

172
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:19,211
who doesn't clean wouldn't throw it away.

173
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:20,911
How about it?

174
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,811
Yes, it's definitely her.

175
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:25,411
"President's Room"

176
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:43,311
I wonder what on earth that vacuum cleaner sucked in?

177
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,911
Why was the trash bag inside the vacuum cleaner taken away?

178
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,911
If it were taken away, for what reason?

179
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,211
Well... I.O.Us that have been taken away,

180
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,411
as well as memos, with all these stuck out to her,

181
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:13,711
she can't make excuses what so ever.

182
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:17,211
I guess I'm not called for this time.

183
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,411
What's that?

184
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,211
The fingertip of the welcoming cat.

185
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,011
I found it under the sofa.

186
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:25,811
It probably came flying over here, when the killer struck him.

187
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:31,411
This is called a flapping clock,

188
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,811
and time ticks away with each flip of the flap.

189
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:38,011
What a thing to still be using in this day and age.

190
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,311
Just like Ms. Imaoka says, it sure is a rare antique.

191
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,711
It flew all the way here.

192
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,811
It's not entirely impossible.

193
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,111
No, but wait a sec.

194
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,611
No,

195
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,811
this didn't fly over.

196
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:56,911
I see!

197
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:59,311
Maybe that's why the culprit vacuumed the place.

198
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:00,711
But, who on earth did it?

199
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:03,011
She confessed to the crime?

200
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,111
And her motive?

201
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:07,211
Clothes, shoes, accessories, bags and watches.

202
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,111
It seems she was largely in debt to Mr. Kanemaru in order to buy

203
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,011
the brand name items that she used to make herself look rich.

204
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:15,411
It wasn't possible for her to repay him

205
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:17,111
even if she quit college and part-timed,

206
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,211
but today she finally...

207
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:23,511
100,000 yen. It doesn't even add up to interest.

208
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,811
My patience is wearing out, too.

209
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,311
I guess I'll call your parents

210
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,311
and have them help you pay me back.

211
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,111
No, don't! Please don't tell my parents.

212
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,911
I beg you!

213
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,011
I'm not volunteering my services or anything, you know.

214
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,211
I lent you money

215
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:39,211
and I'm going to make you pay it back.

216
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:51,011
Then, she took the I.O.U. with her and fled.

217
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,111
This is...

218
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,411
blood?

219
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,711
Something most surely happened in this room.

220
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,611
Yeah, the chances are high.

221
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:05,111
There's evidence of 1/60.

222
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,411
Evidence of 1/60?

223
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,911
Yes. Evidence of once an hour.

224
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:13,011
Well, then. I just remember that I've got some things to attend to

225
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:14,611
so I'm going home.

226
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,411
Hey, Haibara.

227
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:20,111
So, you took the welcoming cat,

228
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:24,311
walked over to the safe and flung it down, is that right?

229
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:29,611
No, that's not right.

230
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:33,111
This case is not that simple.

231
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,246
It's stopped bleeding completely.

232
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:45,346
Thank you.

233
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,246
But, I think you should take him to the vet once.

234
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,246
I guess so.

235
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:59,646
Yeah, just as I thought.

236
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:03,146
Conan, we're going home!

237
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,946
There's enough time to make it for the final race.

238
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,446
May I listen to it at the shop again?

239
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,446
Yes, please do.

240
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:12,646
Inspector, I'll be going then.

241
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:18,146
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,346
Don't tell me you're going to start

243
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:21,246
that "She's not the one who did it" bit again?

244
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,746
Yes, exactly, Inspector.

245
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:28,446
Ms. Chika Murai did actually strike Mr. Kanemaru with the welcoming cat

246
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:30,346
in this office.

247
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,646
But, she should charged for assault.

248
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,246
Assault? Is that it?

249
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:39,946
After being struck by Chika, Mr. Kanemaru probably fainted.

250
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:45,046
It was probably for just a very short while.

251
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:46,946
And at 12:40 p.m.,

252
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:50,846
Mr. Ishigami saw Chika fleeing.

253
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:58,346
However, a few minutes after that Mr. Kanemaru was struck again and killed.

254
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:01,446
You mean he was attacked twice?

255
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:04,846
Please bring the clock that is in the president's room here.

256
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:06,646
-Mr. Hirota. -Yes, sir.

257
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:14,446
Please set the clock back to 12:59 p.m.

258
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,246
This sure is an old-fashioned clock.

259
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:20,946
If I remember correct, it goes...

260
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:26,346
This is...

261
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:30,846
Blood that splattered from Mr. Kanemaru's head when he was hit.

262
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,346
Moreover, it was at the president's room next door

263
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,746
at 12:59 p.m.

264
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:40,146
In other words, she had already left the scene.

265
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:44,546
Don't tell me someone else attacked Mr. Kanemaru?

266
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:48,446
Yes, and that person's the one who killed Mr. Kanemaru.

267
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:51,146
You mean the president's room is the second murder site?

268
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:54,846
I'm sure the killer wiped the blood off on the spot,

269
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:58,146
but the face of the clock happened to change just then,

270
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:01,546
so he probably didn't notice the blood that splattered there.

271
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,746
I see.

272
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,846
And just who is that killer?

273
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:08,246
Please look at the notebook over there.

274
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:11,646
Mr. Kanemaru has left a clue behind.

275
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,446
12:30 p.m., Chika Murai.

276
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:17,346
Below that memo, on the next page.

277
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:21,146
It's blank. There's nothing written?

278
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,046
On the memo that's not there, the name of the person

279
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:27,846
that Mr. Kanemaru was supposed to meet right after Chika was probably written.

280
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:31,246
The killer noticed it and ripped it off.

281
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:37,046
Inspector, please try tracing over that blank sheet of paper there.

282
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:40,746
The slight trace of what was written should be left.

283
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,546
Words are emerging.

284
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:54,046
September 3rd, 1'o clock. Ishigami.

285
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:56,646
Mr. Ishigami,

286
00:16:56,646 --> 00:17:01,046
did you have an appointment to see Mr. Kanemaru at 1 p.m. today?

287
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,546
Oh, yes.

288
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:04,346
I mean no, I did have an appointment

289
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:08,446
but, my shop got busy so I couldn't come here.

290
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,946
Conan, give the thing to the inspector.

291
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,346
Okay.

292
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,346
Here you go.

293
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:17,646
A handkerchief?

294
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,946
Is this blood?

295
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:23,746
Yep, it's the footprints of Cha-cha who hurt his front paw.

296
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:26,946
Inspector,

297
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,646
the cat footprint that you see by the window of the president's room

298
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,346
is supposed to be the same as the one you see on that handkerchief,

299
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:34,246
so please check it.

300
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,846
Mr. Ishigami says he didn't come

301
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,246
but Cha-cha was here.

302
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:44,546
However, it's impossible that the cat would open the door and come in.

303
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,346
Besides, although the window is open,

304
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,946
it is closed off with crime-preventing bars, and even a cat

305
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:53,246
wouldn't be able to jump through the bars into the room.

306
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:56,346
Just as Detective Mouri says, the footprints match.

307
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,646
The only possibility is that

308
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,546
Cha-cha came here together with Mr. Ishigami.

309
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:04,546
Mr. Ishigami made an appointment to come here at 1 p.m.,

310
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:07,546
as was seen on the memo, and met Mr. Kanemaru.

311
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,546
No, I... I didn't come here.

312
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:14,446
There's something over there. I wonder what it is?

313
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,646
There, see under the sofa in the foreground.

314
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:25,146
This also seems to be a cracked piece of the welcoming cat.

315
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,546
Inspector, that's the cracked piece that came from the welcoming cat

316
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,046
that Mr. Ishigami used to kill Mr. Kanemaru.

317
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,746
What?

318
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,446
But, Mr. Mouri,

319
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,346
Ms. Murai says that she attacked Mr. Kanmaru

320
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,346
with the welcoming cat on this shelf.

321
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:42,046
Probably the one that over there.

322
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,846
The cracked pieces here are only of one welcoming cat,

323
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:47,646
so where's the cat that Mr. Ishigami used then?

324
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:49,446
Inspector Megure,

325
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:53,646
isn't the cracked piece from a welcoming cat's left paw?

326
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:58,146
Now that you mentioned it,

327
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:01,646
all the cats here have their right paw raised.

328
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:03,546
Any with the left paw raised...

329
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:07,446
In other words, this one unique cracked piece

330
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:11,746
is from a welcoming cat that is not normally here.

331
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,246
Are you saying that a different type of welcoming cat

332
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:15,646
was brought in here from outside?

333
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:19,946
Mr. Ishigami, you came here a little before 1 p.m. after all,

334
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:22,846
with a welcoming cat that had its left hand raised, didn't you?

335
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:26,546
And, that's when you witnessed Chika, isn't that right?

336
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:37,746
Mr. Kanemaru who was struck by Chika, just fainted on the spot,

337
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:39,346
but regained consciousness immediately.

338
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,546
Then...

339
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,546
Hello there.

340
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,846
Mr. Kanemaru,

341
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,646
what on earth happened here?

342
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,746
Talk about unlucky. A woman, on top of not paying back what I lent her,

343
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,546
suddenly attacked me.

344
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,546
By the way, did you come up with the money?

345
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,846
Oh, no. Not yet...

346
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:58,646
What?

347
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:02,346
So, I brought this as a token of my apology to you.

348
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:05,546
A welcoming cat, that's thoughtful of you.

349
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:07,446
Are you stupid or what?

350
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:11,446
The welcoming cats that I'm collecting all have their right paws raised,

351
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,146
and holding an old Japanese gold coin in their left paw.

352
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,346
I don't want this cat.

353
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,446
Go on home, and make preparations to give your shop over to me.

354
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:20,146
Shut up. Out of my way!

355
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:21,846
I tell you, first it's that woman

356
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,446
and now you...

357
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:31,146
How dare you make light of me.

358
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,646
Cha-cha, who panicked at the sight,

359
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:44,546
hurt his paw with a cracked piece from the welcoming cat

360
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:47,246
and fled outside, in fear from the window.

361
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,146
In the meantime, you flashed upon the idea

362
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:53,546
of framing Chika to be the killer.

363
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:56,946
You move Mr. Kanemaru's body to the office.

364
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:02,346
You went around searching for even the slightest amount

365
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,646
of blood you could find, and wiped them off.

366
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,446
You gathered the large cracked pieces

367
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,646
and sucked the small pieces up with the vacuum cleaner,

368
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:11,046
then you took the trash bag in the vacuum cleaner away.

369
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:15,446
However, unfortunately, you left a number of clues behind.

370
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,646
Mr. Ishigami, is he right?

371
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,946
Not much time has passed from the time of the crime.

372
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:25,446
The range of your activities is also limited now.

373
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:26,746
Therefore, it won't be too difficult

374
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:29,046
looking for the cracked piece from the murder weapon too.

375
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:33,146
Matching the fingerprints, hair and blood and doing a precise check,

376
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:35,946
we'll bring everything into the light.

377
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:43,046
Everything is as Detective Mouri has just said.

378
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:46,346
But, if I couldn't pay Kanemaru back by today

379
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,246
he would've taken my shop from me.

380
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,946
That's why I...

381
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:06,246
The welcoming cat that usually brings happiness,

382
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:09,146
seems have been quite different this time.

383
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,046
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, Conan.

384
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,446
Come here, will you!

385
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:39,646
What?

386
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:41,246
Okay, just great!

387
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:44,146
Get a load of this, it's a welcoming cat that I made.

388
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:46,346
I made it with both paws in the air

389
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:49,246
so that it would beckon money as well as people.

390
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:50,646
Bravo!

391
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,446
My dark horse is gonna win, bravo!

392
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,046
This looks more like a give up pose to me.

393
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:58,846
Like in a hold-up.

394
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,946
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,946
"Wrong Phone Number"
