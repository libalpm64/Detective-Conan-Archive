1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,070
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,770
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,270
The truth in this difficult case becomes clear.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,370
Kisaki and Kujo clash in court!

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,830
The hot springs.

9
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,530
I haven't been to one for so long

10
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,930
and the autumn colors must be lovely this time of year.

11
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,230
Yes, that's right!

12
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,030
I think this open air bath would be great!

13
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,930
They say the water here is good for the complexion!

14
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,030
Mom, you need to take off from work once in a while and relax.

15
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,030
You're right.

16
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,230
Ms. Kuriyama.

17
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,530
How's my schedule for next month?

18
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,230
The conclusion of the trial you're working on now

19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,130
is slated for next week,

20
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,430
so all you have to do is decide whether you want to take the "duty case".

21
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,230
Oh, that's right. I've forgotten about that.

22
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,030
Can you get me the files on that?

23
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,130
Okay.

24
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,030
What's a "duty case"?

25
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,530
Well... when a person is financially

26
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,830
or otherwise unable to hire a lawyer,

27
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,630
the court appoints one,

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,430
but if no one will take the case,

29
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,630
then they'll decide on a "duty" public defender to take the case.

30
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,230
I see.

31
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,230
-Here it is. -Thank you.

32
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,430
I've just taken a fast look

33
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,530
but I don't understand why no one would take this case.

34
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,230
I think this case is defendable.

35
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,930
I guess it's because of the prosecutor

36
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,230
Who would that be?

37
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,030
Ms. Kujo's the prosecutor on this case.

38
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,730
I see.

39
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,130
So it's the prosecution office's Madonna.

40
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,430
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 1)"

41
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,930
What are you going to do?

42
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,130
Shall I tell them you're busy and turn them down?

43
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,730
Excuse me, Ms. Kisaki.

44
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,430
What is the case about?

45
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,030
It happened about a month ago,

46
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,430
an office in a building in Haido was broken into

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,430
and the company president was found dead.

48
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,730
From the fingerprints and evidence found in the room,

49
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,830
the defendant, a confirmed criminal with a record, became the suspect.

50
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,530
It sounds like an open and shut case.

51
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,930
Yes, it does.

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,930
The defendant has confessed that he broke in

53
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,630
thinking the office was empty

54
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,030
but when the victim found him and they struggled, he hit him.

55
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,930
The problem is the charge on the indictment.

56
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,530
What's the charge?

57
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,230
He's being indicted for burglary and murder.

58
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,530
Murder?

59
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,230
But this case sounds more like accidental death, doesn't it?

60
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,530
Yes.

61
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,330
I don't think Prosecutor Kujo

62
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,330
would make a mistake as big as this.

63
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,930
Ms. Kuriyama,

64
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,230
I have the prosecutor's report and the deposition

65
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,030
but the crime scene investigation report isn't here,

66
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,730
could you have them send it up?

67
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,230
And I'll need the coroner's report too.

68
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,530
Okay.

69
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,630
Mom.

70
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,230
Sorry, Ran. As you can see,

71
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,430
I won't be able to go to the hot springs with you, maybe another time.

72
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,830
Good grief.

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,930
"Tokyo Prison"

74
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,930
Let me ask you one more time.

75
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,730
On the night of the crime,

76
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,130
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -you entered the Otsu Realty Office

77
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,430
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -on the second floor of the Nomoto Building

78
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,430
by breaking the window.

79
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,330
You searched the office

80
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,630
and then tried to open the safe in the president's office.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,130
But the president, Mr. Otsu, unexpectedly returned to the office,

82
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,730
he saw you

83
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,630
and you two fought.

84
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:28,230
You then hit the victim on the head with an ashtray

85
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,230
causing his death.

86
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,430
Is that correct?

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,830
Yeah.

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,630
What happened to the money that was in the safe?

89
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,930
How should I know?

90
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,630
But according to the employees' statements,

91
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,130
they had just closed a deal and there was 12 million yen in the safe

92
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,030
but it disappeared.

93
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,030
The prosecutor is saying that

94
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,030
you took the money after killing Mr. Otsu

95
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,130
It wasn't me! I'm telling you the truth!

96
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,630
It's true, no money was found in your apartment

97
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,130
but your fingerprints were on the safe

98
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,130
so I don't blame the prosecution for suspecting you, don't you agree?

99
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,530
I really didn't take the money and about that person...

100
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,130
"That person"?

101
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,530
Did you know the victim?

102
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,730
How many times did you hit the victim on the head?

103
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,030
I don't remember.

104
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,930
Once? Twice?

105
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,430
I don't remember.

106
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,130
He surprised me when he walked in, my mind went blank.

107
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,930
The coroner's report said

108
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,530
the victim received three blows to the head.

109
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,830
The third blow was the one that killed him.

110
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,630
Striking him once, is understandable

111
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,330
but since there was a second and then a third,

112
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,430
could show intent to commit murder.

113
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,730
I honestly don't remember.

114
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,330
I see.

115
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,530
Well, I'm on your side

116
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,630
so I want you to tell me the truth,

117
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,130
even if it's detrimental to your case, all right?

118
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,930
I just want to make absolutely sure,

119
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,630
are you positive you had no intention of killing the victim?

120
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,230
I'm positive.

121
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,430
All right.

122
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,530
We'll argue our case on that point alone in court.

123
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,530
Thank you.

124
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,730
"Tokyo Courthouse" -The defendant Takashi Inoue,

125
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,130
at approximately 20:30 on the evening of the incident,

126
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,230
broke the window to the Otsu Realty Office

127
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,630
on the second floor of the Nomoto Building

128
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,230
located at 2-9 Haido-cho Sanchome.

129
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,830
While he was ransacking the president, Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu's office,

130
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,330
the victim, Mr. Otsu, returned and saw him.

131
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,230
The defendant then used the weapon he had

132
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,630
to threaten the victim

133
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,630
and forced the victim to open the safe in the office.

134
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,730
The defendant then struck the victim three times

135
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,430
on the back of the head causing the victim's death.

136
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,530
The defendant then escaped with the 12 million yen in cash

137
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,230
which was in the safe.

138
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,430
According to penal code 240,

139
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,330
the prosecution asks the defendant to be sentenced to life imprisonment

140
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,130
for burglary and murder.

141
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,530
Does the defendant have anything to say

142
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,730
regarding the charges the prosecution has just stated?

143
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,730
Do you wish to deny the charges?

144
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,430
I just broke in to rob the place,

145
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,030
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

146
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,530
Your honor!

147
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,530
The defense may speak.

148
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,630
The indictment states my client is guilty of burglary and murder

149
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,530
but my client would like to plead not guilty

150
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,230
to the charge of murder.

151
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,930
So you're pleading not guilty to burglary and murder, is that correct?

152
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,430
Correct. The defense asks the defendant be charged

153
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,330
under penal code 205, accidental death.

154
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,230
The defense is challenging the prosecution's indictment,

155
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,730
do you have anything to say?

156
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,230
Yes, I do.

157
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,130
Could the defendant tell me why he broke into the victim's office?

158
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,030
Well, I was looking for someplace to broke into

159
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,330
and it just caught my eye, that's all.

160
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,130
Then you are claiming it was mere coincidence

161
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,430
that you broke into the victim's office

162
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,230
and that you held no grudge toward Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu, is that correct?

163
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,230
Right.

164
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,930
I wonder what she's trying to get at.

165
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,430
Your honor. The prosecution's line of questioning is unclear!

166
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,930
All right then.

167
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,830
Does the defendant know a woman named Noriko Endo?

168
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,930
Well?

169
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,530
Don't tell me you've forgotten your only daughter's name?

170
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,530
Only daughter?

171
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,830
Here it is!

172
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,930
When he divorced his wife 20 years ago,

173
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,330
his daughter was 8 years old.

174
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,330
I wonder what that has to do with the case though.

175
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,230
Aren't you going to answer me?

176
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,930
Objection!

177
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,030
The prosecution is merely trying to confuse the defendant

178
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,630
by mentioning a family member's name!

179
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,730
Does this daughter have anything to do with the case?

180
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,830
Yes.

181
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,330
Noriko Endo runs a pub in another building

182
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,530
the victim's company manages

183
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,830
and there are rumors that she and the victim, Toshiyuki Otsu,

184
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,530
were involved in a personal relationship.

185
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,030
So you are claiming the defendant had a premeditated motive

186
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,430
for breaking into the victim's office, is that correct?

187
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,830
Yes.

188
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,730
We have proof that the defendant held a grudge

189
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,630
against the victim over his daughter

190
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,430
You're wrong! I don't even know the creep!

191
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,330
Would you like to ask her yourself then?

192
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,830
She's in the gallery,

193
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,530
we can have her take the witness stand if you'd like.

194
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,930
"Noriko Endo (28)" -Dad.

195
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,330
Noriko.

196
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,130
So that's the ace that the Madonna had up her sleeve.

197
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,630
We are prepared to call Ms. Endo

198
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,730
to the witness stand if necessary.

199
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,430
So what the prosecutor said was true?

200
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,830
Yes, that man tricked me.

201
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,030
He told me he'd let me have my own business,

202
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,330
then he used me.

203
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,630
When did you start communicating with your father?

204
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,430
We met two years ago when mother died after an illness,

205
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,130
he'd drop in to my pub every now and then to see me.

206
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,330
And you told him about Mr. Otsu?

207
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,530
He said he'd get him to pay me consolation money.

208
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,730
This case isn't looking too good.

209
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,830
What do you mean?

210
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,430
Well, if you had a motive and struck the victim three times,

211
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,530
no one would believe you didn't mean to kill him.

212
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,930
I see.

213
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,130
One last question and I'd like you to give me an honest answer.

214
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,730
Do you think your father killed Toshiyuki Otsu?

215
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,830
No! He may be a good for nothing thief

216
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,830
but he's not capable of murder!

217
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,930
I see.

218
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,130
She's going to have it hard this time.

219
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,180
Good grief, dad.

220
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,980
Sleeping again?

221
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,680
I always close my eyes when I'm thinking!

222
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,580
Who says I was sleeping?

223
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
I see.

224
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,080
So you must've thought of something that would help mom then!

225
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,180
Well, you see...

226
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,080
It's her fault for taking a case like this in the first place!

227
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,680
The defendant had a motive for committing murder.

228
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Moreover, he left his fingerprints all over the safe's dial.

229
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,580
How in the world can she think she can get him off?

230
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,380
I wonder why his fingerprints were only on the safe's dial though.

231
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,180
Easy, he probably wore gloves when he broke in.

232
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,180
But he couldn't turn the dial with them on so he took them off!

233
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,680
That's when the victim came in,

234
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,880
he hit him over the head with the ashtray.

235
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
If that's how it went,

236
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,980
then there should've been fingerprints on the ashtray.

237
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,380
I guess, since he took his gloves off.

238
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,680
But they didn't find any.

239
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,980
Well, he probably wiped them off, that's why!

240
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,080
Give those to me!

241
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,580
Read this part carefully!

242
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,980
It says that there were traces that

243
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,580
it'd been wiped with a cloth containing oil!

244
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,480
Then why didn't he wipe the safe at the same time too?

245
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
Well, that's because he'd just killed someone,

246
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,180
he panicked and forgot, he just ran out of there.

247
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,780
I see.

248
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,980
So when did he take the money from the safe?

249
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,480
Well, after he killed the victim, he opened the safe one more time.

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,280
But you just said he panicked and ran out of there

251
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,680
Well...

252
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,580
It just doesn't make any sense.

253
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,680
You're stupid!

254
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,180
Criminals aren't logical, that's why!

255
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,980
What's that supposed to mean? You're just making excuses!

256
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,180
Shut up! Kids should mind their own business!

257
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,480
Wait a minute dad, where're you going?

258
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,780
Play "pachinko".

259
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,380
Good grief!

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,180
"Things found at the crime scene"

261
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,380
"Glass Ashtray, a pair of army cotton gloves"

262
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,180
"screw for eyeglasses, golf ball"

263
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Oh, Kogoro...

264
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,080
Oh, it's you.

265
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,180
What are you doing here?

266
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,480
I just...

267
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,680
He wanted to see if there was anything he could help you with

268
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,580
so he came to check the scene of the crime.

269
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,280
Shut up you little brat!

270
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,080
For a famous private detective,

271
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,680
you sure have a lot of free time, don't you?

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,180
What did you say?

273
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,080
Did you come to check the scene too?

274
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,380
That's right. I just got permission from the superintendent.

275
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
"Takuya Akiyama (56), Superintendent" -Sorry to keep you waiting.

276
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,180
Follow me, it's this way.

277
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,980
Were you the first one to discover the body?

278
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,480
That's right, kid.

279
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,580
Could you tell me about it in detail?

280
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,980
At about 9 that night,

281
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,780
I was watching a baseball game on TV.

282
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,780
Why Mr. Arima?

283
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,980
Did you see the president?

284
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,980
No, nobody was in the office when I made my rounds at 8 pm.

285
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,280
That's strange.

286
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,180
When he left my place a little while ago,

287
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,480
he said he was coming back here.

288
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,280
Then he must've come in through the emergency exit.

289
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,280
But his office door's locked

290
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,880
and I called but there was no answer.

291
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Maybe he's at the back, in his office.

292
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,680
He forgot his glasses, so I came to give them to him.

293
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,880
I hate to ask but can you come with me and open the door?

294
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,380
Sure.

295
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,480
Mr. Arima is Mr. Otsu's son-in-law, isn't he?

296
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,580
Yes, he runs an Italian restaurant in the neighborhood.

297
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,980
And this door was locked, you say?

298
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,180
Yes. I used this spare key to get in.

299
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,180
It doesn't look like he's here after all.

300
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,180
Father, are you in there?

301
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,080
It's me, Masahiko.

302
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
That's strange.

303
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,880
What's this? There's somebody inside!

304
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,380
This is bad!

305
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,580
What is it?

306
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,880
Somebody's getting beaten up in there!

307
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,780
What?

308
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,680
The key! Open this door!

309
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,180
Only Mr. Otsu has the key to this office!

310
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,280
Darn it! Get out of the way!

311
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,180
Father!

312
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,280
Father, please hang in there!

313
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,380
Mr. Akiyama, call an ambulance!

314
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,580
Oh, right!

315
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,380
Is that the office where it happened?

316
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,380
Yes.

317
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,480
Hey, this door's locked.

318
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,680
Mr. Arima has the key to that room.

319
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
There he is!

320
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,280
Mr. Arima, this is Ms. Kisaki,

321
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,980
the lawyer I told you about on the telephone.

322
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,280
And I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

323
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,880
"Masahiko Arima (35)" -You're that famous detective!

324
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,580
Yes, I suppose so.

325
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,480
Mr. Arima, I'm sorry we had to bother you at work.

326
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,980
We'd like to take a look around your father-in-law's office.

327
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Isn't anybody using this office?

328
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
No.

329
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,180
The police said we could

330
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,680
but since father was killed in here so tragically,

331
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,180
I haven't decided what to do with it yet.

332
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,880
Go ahead, I've left it exactly as the police left it.

333
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Thank you.

334
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,980
By the way, Mr. Arima,

335
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,080
where was the victim's body lying?

336
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Let's see, right about here in front of the safe,

337
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,380
he was lying clutching his head.

338
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,480
I see.

339
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,780
I've got it!

340
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,480
What do you mean?

341
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,680
I bet Mr. Otsu caught Inoue trying to open the safe.

342
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,180
The defendant confessed to that in the very beginning

343
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,880
What's important is what happened after.

344
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,180
Inoue was hiding a knife or something,

345
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,880
he threatened the victim and forced him to open the safe.

346
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,080
When the safe was opened,

347
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,280
he hit the victim with the ashtray from behind.

348
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,380
You're not implying the defendant was lying, are you?

349
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,280
Well, I guess you could say I am.

350
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,580
How can you expect to defend a client

351
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,780
if you don't believe him!

352
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,480
You can say what you want

353
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,580
but that "Madonna" is going to fry you in court!

354
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,680
What's that?

355
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,380
Wait a minute.

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,580
It can't be...

357
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,280
Hey, is that the window you saw the killer through, sir?

358
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,380
-That's right. -I see.

359
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,180
Hey, Conan! What're you up to?

360
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,580
Pops Kogoro,

361
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,380
could you stand in front of the safe one more time for me?

362
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,580
Gosh. Now what?

363
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,780
Here?

364
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,880
Hold it right there!

365
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,080
I knew it!

366
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
I don't get it.

367
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,080
The partition is blocking the way, I can't see you from here!

368
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,480
What did you say?

369
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,880
Mr. Akiyama, what is the meaning of this?

370
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Well, I wasn't looking over there.

371
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,180
I was only looking at the person's shadow reflected

372
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,780
on this wall over here.

373
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,580
Did you say the reflection on the wall?

374
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,080
Yes. There weren't any lights on in the room that night

375
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,780
and the neon lights from outside the window came in.

376
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,180
That's how I saw the killer's shadow.

377
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,180
He hit Mr. Otsu over and over again.

378
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,980
Besides, I heard Mr. Otsu fall after that,

379
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm positive about that!

380
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,880
Let me clarify one point,

381
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,380
you didn't actually see the defendant strike the victim, did you?

382
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,980
But Ms. Kisaki

383
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,780
I don't see how much difference it makes.

384
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,180
The defendant himself has confessed to hitting my father-in-law, right?

385
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,680
That's where you're wrong Mr. Arima.

386
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,380
There's a big difference in actually seeing the beating

387
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,580
and seeing the shadow of someone being beaten!

388
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,680
Besides, until the defendant is found guilty in court,

389
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,580
he is presumed innocent!

390
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,980
Unfortunately, most people forget that fact.

391
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,980
I'm sorry then.

392
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,380
Excuse me, sir

393
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
What is it?

394
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,180
This clock isn't working.

395
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,780
The late president won that in a golf tournament

396
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,580
he just left it there for decoration,

397
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,880
he never used it.

398
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,080
Mr. Arima, I need to ask you.

399
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,180
Yes, what is it?

400
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,180
Was there anyone besides the victim

401
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,380
who knew the combination to the safe?

402
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
No, he was the only one.

403
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,680
He was a man one operation,

404
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,880
he didn't even tell the accountant.

405
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,180
Watch it! Stop wandering around!

406
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,880
What's this?

407
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,180
That's it, I've got it now!

408
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,880
I've solved the mystery behind this case.

409
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,580
The silhouette of something being hit

410
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,280
that Mr. Akiyama said he saw

411
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,880
and the sound of something falling,

412
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,180
everything can be this trick will explain everything

413
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,380
and the only one who could've have set it up is

414
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,280
that person!

415
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,560
Next Conan Hint:

416
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,740
"Glasses"

417
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,660
-Next episode, let's put an end to this case! -Dad, help mom.

418
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
Ms. Kujo, the prosecutor, is so pretty!
