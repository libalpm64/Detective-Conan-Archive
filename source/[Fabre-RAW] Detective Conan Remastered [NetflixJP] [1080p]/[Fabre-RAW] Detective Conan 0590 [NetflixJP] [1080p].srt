1
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:05,005
Found within Pop's wallet

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,005
was a receipt for a 50,000-yen necklace.

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,991
It seemed to be a birthday present for Ran's mother,

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,605
Attorney Kisaki, who was born on October 10th.

5
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:19,105
After learning of that, Ran displayed her tremendous lottery luck

6
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:22,005
and won tickets for a hotel stay.

7
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:30,009
As a result, we ended up enjoying a fancy dinner in a seaside hotel,

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,705
but Pops didn't seem to plan to give her the present

9
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:35,305
and even got drunk and fell asleep.

10
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:38,905
Attorney Kisaki who was upset went back to her room.

11
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:44,505
Just before midnight and the end of the birthday,

12
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:48,805
Ran tried to get Pops to deliver his present at any cost.

13
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,205
But soon after we barged into the room,

14
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,905
we discovered a murdered female body.

15
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,105
That woman was Mrs. Akiho Kokubu, a client of Attorney Kisaki

16
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:03,105
who had a stalker problem and was in the process

17
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,705
"Akiho Kobuku (28), Client" -of settling the case out of court.

18
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:09,605
The body wasn't there when Attorney Kisaki returned to her room,

19
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:13,605
but it appeared out of nowhere while she was taking a shower.

20
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:18,057
Looks like the culprit moved the bed

21
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,705
and hid under it along with the body.

22
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,505
Accompanied by Inspector Yokomizo,

23
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:29,605
we began questioning all of the hotel guests in connection to Akiho.

24
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:51,705
Brooding over passing seasons

25
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,705
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

26
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,705
Fulfill Ran's wish, Pops.

27
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,605
Make great deductions once in a while without going to sleep.

28
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:59,305
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:01,205
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,405
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:31,323
"The Worst Birthday (Part 2)"

32
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,923
My wife was murdered?

33
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:38,523
Who... Who did it? And why?

34
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:41,323
We're currently investigating that.

35
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:45,723
But why didn't you pick your wife up?

36
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:48,207
"Takehiko Kokubu (30)" -I did call

37
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,423
"Akiho's Husband" -and say I'd pick her up,

38
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:52,723
but she bellowed that she wouldn't let me in even if I came over.

39
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:55,123
What was the cause of your argument?

40
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,923
Well, it was...

41
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:58,923
Was it about this?

42
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:03,023
It's a bunch of mini cars.

43
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:05,323
I've loved cars since I was a kid,

44
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,523
and lining them up helps me feel calm.

45
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:11,123
But how could this have caused the fight?

46
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,723
See.

47
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:15,823
The side mirror was tossed onto the floor.

48
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:19,823
A man who loves cars wouldn't do something this violent, right?

49
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:21,623
So your wife did this?

50
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,923
Yeah. She told me to quit this childish and disgusting hobby

51
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,245
and threw it.

52
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:30,723
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

53
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:36,823
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

54
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:38,523
This Porsche.

55
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:42,261
That woman was murdered?

56
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,823
"Midori Hino (51)" -Well, I always figured...

57
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,623
"Opposing Party In The Negotiation" -one of the foolish men she deceived

58
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:50,269
would eventually kill her.

59
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:54,273
On that note, it's my understanding that you called the victim.

60
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:58,277
Yeah, I was calling the attorney to see

61
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,423
if we could slightly change the time of our negotiation tomorrow.

62
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:04,623
But I was shocked when that woman picked up the phone.

63
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:08,287
Why did you wish to change the time?

64
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:12,623
The golf appointment I have with a friend got moved up.

65
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:15,423
So you plan to play golf soon after

66
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:17,323
your stalker son's settlement negotiations?

67
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,923
There's another occupant in this room.

68
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,223
What?

69
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:25,223
There aren't lipstick marks on these cigarette butts.

70
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:30,023
And the filter is still damp.

71
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,823
It really is.

72
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,423
Is that right?

73
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:37,823
That's enough, Seiji!

74
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:39,523
Get out here!

75
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:44,723
"Seiji Hino (26), Hidori's Son" -So that's your stalker son?

76
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:47,323
I told you that my son was only deceived.

77
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:52,023
But you were instructed not to bring your son here, were you not?

78
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,723
Well, he happened to be here

79
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,337
because he'll be touring with his friends

80
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,623
on their bikes tomorrow morning.

81
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:03,423
Then show us that bike.

82
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,623
Right here.

83
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:08,923
Look.

84
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,423
A road bike?

85
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:17,323
Incidentally, please tell us your whereabouts and what you did

86
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,823
between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm.

87
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:21,823
I was drinking with my mom.

88
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,363
If you think we're lying, verify it yourself.

89
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,523
We were at the hotel lounge on the top floor.

90
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,223
It certainly appears that the mother and son

91
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,523
were drinking together from 9.00 pm to 12.00 am.

92
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,923
Yes, and it seems they both went to the restroom once.

93
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,423
But it was at different times,

94
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:46,723
so neither of them could have moved the bed.

95
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:49,023
Well, it's getting late now.

96
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:51,123
Let's continue the investigation at dawn.

97
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,393
And where do you propose I should stay?

98
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,923
Why don't you just stay in Mr. Mouri's room?

99
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,723
You two are a married couple.

100
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:00,723
I should note that we're living separately.

101
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:08,407
Well, this was inevitable.

102
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,723
There's something under the pillow.

103
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,523
A present?

104
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:18,417
Pops had it prepared after all, didn't he?

105
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:21,623
But why didn't he give it to her yesterday, on October 10th?

106
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:24,423
October 10th is my mom's birthday.

107
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:29,323
I'll win the first place and give her the red ribbon as present!

108
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:32,431
Don't tell me, Pops...

109
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,723
You can't raise it then lower it.

110
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:39,823
You have to lower the expectation, then raise it for a surprise.

111
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:45,023
Raise and then lower. Lower and then raise?

112
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:54,223
I see, so that's how it was.

113
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:58,457
The culprit utilized that to move the bed easily.

114
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:02,223
He did it single-handedly without anyone's help.

115
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,463
"October 11th"

116
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,465
Come on, please.

117
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:09,923
We finally had the chance to stay at a hotel as a family,

118
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,123
and this is a buffet.

119
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,323
Why are you sitting at different tables?

120
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:19,823
I was the one who sat down first.

121
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,523
Isn't that moustached old man

122
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,223
the one who purposely sat at another table?

123
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:28,487
It can't be helped. I have a lot on my mind.

124
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:32,491
Such as how I'm going to prove the innocence of my wife

125
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,423
who has become a murder suspect.

126
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:36,823
Dad!

127
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,523
Ran, don't be fooled.

128
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,923
There's no telling what he's up to.

129
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,723
Mom.

130
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,823
He's checking the time.

131
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:50,823
And he's checking the present as well.

132
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,023
The moment is approaching.

133
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:56,515
He's suddenly starting to be nice to the recipient.

134
00:08:56,723 --> 00:09:00,823
Well, I might as well put Pops to sleep

135
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,423
and solve this case quickly.

136
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:08,223
Darn it. At such a critical moment,

137
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:12,531
why can't I find the key to solving this case at all?

138
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:14,223
Darn it.

139
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,537
Well, since this special day only comes once a year,

140
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:21,823
I'll let Pops show off this time.

141
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,545
It looks like a dish is brought out!

142
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,823
-What? -How amazing.

143
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:32,223
Something so heavy is being moved by a single person.

144
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,223
It's not amazing.

145
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,555
Since there are wheels on the bottom,

146
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,557
it's easy for even a single person to move.

147
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,823
Wheels on the bottom?

148
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:44,323
Hey, what is this?

149
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:46,923
This?

150
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:50,023
Sausages! They look tasty!

151
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,723
Oh, no! The ketchup!

152
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:58,023
Conan! What are you doing?

153
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:01,623
It's all right. I'll bring another one.

154
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:02,923
Gosh.

155
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:12,323
What is this? The ketchup marks look like dots.

156
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:15,823
Isn't it incredible that the marks are evenly spaced?

157
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,423
Idiot! It's nothing incredible at all.

158
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:23,723
The ketchup on the wheels will leave marks on the floor as it rolls,

159
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,605
creating evenly spaced marks.

160
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,223
Wait a second.

161
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,123
Where have I seen this mark before?

162
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,623
I see. So that's what happened!

163
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,023
You finally got it.

164
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,523
Ran! Call Yokomizo now!

165
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,629
What?

166
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,423
Have him gather the suspects to the room where the crime took place!

167
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,123
Then, does that mean...

168
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,623
Yeah, I've figured it out.

169
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,923
The trick behind that locked room murder

170
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:04,123
and the culprit who devised it!

171
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:08,123
Kogoro Mouri's deduction show is about to begin!

172
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,533
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.

173
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,833
It took us a while to get here.

174
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,133
Because by the time Ran contacted us,

175
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:31,133
the three of them had already checked out of the hotel.

176
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:33,633
So why did you call us here?

177
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,933
I thought there wasn't anything left to talk about.

178
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:41,733
I bet they're still suspecting us.

179
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:45,333
What is this about? Don't we have an alibi

180
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:49,233
from 10:00 to 11:00 pm, the supposed time of the crime?

181
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,691
My son and I were drinking in the hotel lounge!

182
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,233
But it seems you both left to use the restroom once.

183
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:00,233
We went separately! And it was only for about 10 minutes.

184
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:06,133
Besides, the corpse was in the room where that attorney stayed.

185
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,633
When the attorney came back at 11:00 pm,

186
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:12,033
the woman's body wasn't there.

187
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,713
The body was discovered around midnight

188
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:20,333
after she took a shower and let Detective Mouri enter the room.

189
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,533
If that's the case, isn't this a locked room murder?

190
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,033
That's true.

191
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,233
Since the hotel rooms are auto-locked,

192
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,533
you can't get in without a keycard.

193
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,833
If my wife was in the room,

194
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,233
she could have opened the door for me.

195
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,433
But when you returned to the room, my wife wasn't there, right?

196
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,433
Yes.

197
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:42,033
No, she was already in the room.

198
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,733
I mean your wife. -What?

199
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:48,733
She was already killed and hidden under the bed.

200
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,533
-What? -Under the bed?

201
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,133
It can't be.

202
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,833
And then the culprit moved the bed when Eri was showering,

203
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,833
disclosed the body, and fled from this room.

204
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,733
Moved the bed?

205
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,233
But how?

206
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,633
Please wait a minute.

207
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,033
Is this all right?

208
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,133
You're not doing what you usually do.

209
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,333
-Usual? -I mean this.

210
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:19,333
Just like that.

211
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,779
What on earth was that?

212
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,781
Hey!

213
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,933
Can you tell us how the bed was moved?

214
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,633
That's right.

215
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:32,133
Before I returned to the room, if the culprit killed Akiho,

216
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:35,133
concealed the body under the moved bed,

217
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,833
and then hid himself next to the body,

218
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,733
he could've made me not notice them when I came in.

219
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,803
And while I was showering, it's possible

220
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,333
that he moved the bed back to reveal the body

221
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,833
and snuck out of the room.

222
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:56,533
It's a herculean task for a single person to slide a bed that heavy

223
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,133
without leaving drag marks on the carpet.

224
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,733
Even if Akiho who was sleeping in my room

225
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,433
was killed by her husband, Takehiko,

226
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:08,133
he would have been by himself when he came to get her.

227
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:12,633
As for the two of you who knew Akiho was in my room,

228
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:16,033
you could've moved the bed by working together.

229
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,633
But at the time of crime,

230
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:20,839
there wasn't a moment in which you were both gone,

231
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:23,233
so that's impossible.

232
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:27,933
Under such circumstances, how was the bed moved and who did it?

233
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,633
Mr. Detective.

234
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,851
By putting wheels under the bed.

235
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,333
-Wheels? -I see!

236
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,233
Seiji had a road bike.

237
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:42,233
He must have utilized the bike's tires.

238
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,533
Utilized them...

239
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,233
How did he do it?

240
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,333
It wasn't the bike!

241
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,869
Wasn't there someone with toys

242
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,533
that could easily be placed under the bed?

243
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,333
By toys, do you mean the mini cars?

244
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,133
Yeah, that's right.

245
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,533
A single person can lift a bed one corner at a time

246
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,133
and place a mini car under each leg.

247
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,633
With wheels under each of the four bed legs,

248
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:11,333
it would be easy for one to slide the bed.

249
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,633
The person who was lining up mini cars in the hotel room

250
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:18,233
was you, Mr. Takehiko!

251
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:21,333
The proof is the small blood tracks

252
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,633
that are evenly spaced near the leg of the bed.

253
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,533
It's likely that the mini car tires

254
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:30,909
ran over the blood stains on the carpet when you moved the bed.

255
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,913
I guess you've already disposed of those mini cars though.

256
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:39,233
But Mr. Mouri, if he had just placed the bed on top of the mini cars,

257
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:43,733
it would have slipped off while it was being moved.

258
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:46,925
That's true.

259
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:50,929
So it turns out you didn't figure it out, Pops.

260
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,633
I don't think a man who likes mini cars so much

261
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:57,233
would do anything like that to damage them.

262
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:02,033
He was so proud of them when he showed them to me yesterday.

263
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:06,033
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

264
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:12,333
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

265
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,533
This Porsche.

266
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:18,957
The car that James Dean drove, the Porsche 911.

267
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,959
Porsche 911?

268
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,633
But the car that James Dean drove was...

269
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,933
The Porsche 550 Spider, a convertible.

270
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,969
I see! He could have placed the bed leg

271
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,733
into the opening where the seats are.

272
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:38,033
That... That would certainly stabilize it.

273
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:42,633
That's why you couldn't show the 550 Spider to Conan.

274
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:46,733
It's because the bed leg damaged the seats.

275
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:50,433
But why didn't Mr. Takehiko leave immediately after the murder

276
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,133
instead of using that trick?

277
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,933
If Eri had discovered the body immediately after returning to the room,

278
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,433
he'd become the first suspect

279
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:03,001
since she had asked him to come and pick the victim up.

280
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,733
That's why after killing your wife,

281
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,533
you held the door open using a stopper and returned to your room,

282
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:13,433
then came back with your mini cars and deployed the trick, didn't you?

283
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,133
You figured that if it seemed like an impossible crime,

284
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,033
it would divert attention away from you.

285
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,633
But the trick couldn't be used

286
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:26,133
if the attorney hadn't gone into the bathroom.

287
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:30,133
That's why you were very lucky.

288
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:35,033
But who would wait under the bed with a body on such an off chance?

289
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,433
That's true.

290
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:39,037
No one in their right mind would do that.

291
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,133
Encouraged from a few drinks, perhaps?

292
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,533
I don't think so.

293
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:46,033
Speaking of drinking,

294
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,233
whenever Pops comes home from drinking,

295
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,733
he usually shouts something, doesn't he?

296
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,533
"Ran, bring me some water."

297
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,433
That's true, but...

298
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,933
Why are you bringing that up now?

299
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,833
The reason why one gets thirsty after drinking

300
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:05,333
is that a dehydration reaction occurs as the body breaks down alcohol.

301
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:09,733
You already knew I would come back to the room at around 11:00 pm.

302
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:13,333
You could have assumed that I was going for a drink with someone.

303
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,733
That's why...

304
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:19,333
you put only carbonated drinks in my refrigerator

305
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,833
and shook up every single can.

306
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,433
That way, when I open it,

307
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:28,233
the content would spray up and force me to take a shower.

308
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:33,933
Well, since we haven't found the murder weapon,

309
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,133
why don't we examine

310
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:41,099
the glass ashtray in Room 309 where Takehiko was staying?

311
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,733
It seems all of the rooms have those ashtrays.

312
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,533
If he took the murder weapon with him

313
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,933
to make it seem like an extremely impossible crime,

314
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:54,233
he would have to switch it with the one in his room.

315
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,633
A short while later,

316
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:02,533
luminal reaction test on the ashtray in Room 309 proved positive.

317
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,123
It was Akiho's blood.

318
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:09,127
Takehiko also confessed to the crime.

319
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,133
The motive was the mini cars.

320
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,633
He had heard that Akiho was a former race queen

321
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,133
and model who liked mini cars,

322
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,633
so they got along well and got married.

323
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,933
But last night, she laughed and told him that it was all a lie

324
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:24,833
in order to lure a wealthy man like Takehiko to herself.

325
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:30,433
What pushed him over the edge were her final words.

326
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:35,533
Have you realized the meaning of the birthday present I gave you?

327
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:38,633
Yeah, the 550 Spider?

328
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:42,833
That was the beloved car of a famous movie star, right?

329
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,833
It's a car you can't buy unless you're rich, right?

330
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:50,533
In other words, I only married you because of your money.

331
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,933
I can't wait to inherit it after your death!

332
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,233
That was quite a present, wasn't it?

333
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:05,733
Yeah, I wouldn't want to get something like that.

334
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:10,833
My, my. I think it's better than getting nothing at all.

335
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,833
All right, I'll be heading home now.

336
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,133
Aren't you going to stay at the hotel?

337
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,733
It's already 11:00 pm.

338
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,733
It's fine. I've already called a taxi.

339
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,533
-See you. -Don't leave.

340
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:28,233
Although there's only an hour left, it's still your birthday.

341
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,733
Why don't the two of us celebrate it?

342
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,633
We'll send Ran and the brat off to another room...

343
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,217
and relive the time when we were lovers.

344
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:42,333
This is a little something from me.

345
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,233
Well, since you're an adult, I guess you won't be thrilled

346
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,033
receiving something trivial like a birthday present.

347
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,933
Excuse me. Whose birthday is it?

348
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,833
Yours, of course!

349
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,633
-It's the same day as Sports Day! -What?

350
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:02,233
Speaking of Sports Day, it used to be on October 10th, right?

351
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:06,933
That's right. But now it falls on the second Monday in October.

352
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,133
What?

353
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:15,253
Does dad only remembers mom's birthday through Sports Day?

354
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,255
It's because when we were kids,

355
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,933
you always said this at the Sports Day event,

356
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:23,533
"Today's my birthday, so I can't lose"!

357
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,133
October 10th is usually a bright and sunny day,

358
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:30,233
so schools used to hold their sports event on that day.

359
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:34,933
What is this? I purposely lowered and raised the expectation.

360
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,733
So it was all meaningless?

361
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,833
Lowered and then raised it?

362
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,279
So that's why you were so cold to mom.

363
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,633
You didn't need to lower her expectations.

364
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:50,533
In any case, I'll gladly accept these spoils of war,

365
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,291
you dumb detective.

366
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,233
"Law Eri Kisaki" -And the next day...

367
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,385
Hey.

368
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:31,389
What in the world is this? The content of the present!

369
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:35,393
I thought it was a necklace, but they're prayer beads!

370
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:40,433
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Is that man telling me to die?

371
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:44,433
The manager at Poirot asked dad to buy those prayer beads.

372
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,933
It looks like he brought the wrong thing by mistake.

373
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,720
There it is!

374
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,280
Pops, that's too big of a mistake.

375
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,992
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:05,423
