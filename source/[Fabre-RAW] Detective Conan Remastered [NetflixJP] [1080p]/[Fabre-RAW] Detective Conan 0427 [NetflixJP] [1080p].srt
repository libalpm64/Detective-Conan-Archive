1
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,561
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:05,461
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:06,861
A composed and intelligent girl.

4
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:08,461
On the 4th grader who resembles Haibara!

5
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:10,361
An unexpected accident closes in.

6
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:11,761
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,561
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,461
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,071
Yaiba Kick!

10
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:13,371
See? I look like him, don't I?

11
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,271
Yeah, you look just like him!

12
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,671
Genta, stop talking and clean up!

13
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:25,371
Stop! So you've come, mole monster!

14
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,871
Masked Yaiba!

15
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,971
Hey! Genta Kojima!

16
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,771
Yes!

17
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,171
Hey, Genta.

18
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,171
Stop playing and let's finish cleaning.

19
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,671
If you don't cut it out, I'm going to tell the teacher!

20
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:43,271
Although my appearance is that of an elementary school student...

21
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,771
even the teacher doesn't get me nervous.

22
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,971
Genta!

23
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:57,171
Well, peacefulness is best I guess.

24
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:03,271
Let's finish up quickly!

25
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:07,871
Bad news...

26
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,371
Bad news.

27
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:20,871
It hurts.

28
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:22,671
Are you all right, Mitsuhiko?

29
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:25,571
What's the rush?

30
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,871
A case!

31
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:29,671
-A case? -A case?

32
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:32,571
A 4th grade girl disappeared!

33
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,671
-Disappeared? -Disappeared?

34
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,871
Yes.

35
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:40,071
Actually, her big sister and my big sister are classmates.

36
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,071
When I was small,

37
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:44,671
she used to come over to my house with her big sister to play.

38
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,871
That's how I got to know her.

39
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:51,371
But I suddenly got a call from her yesterday

40
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:55,371
and we promised to walk home together today.

41
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:58,271
So I went to her classroom a while ago...

42
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,971
and was told that she didn't come to school today.

43
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:05,571
Maybe she caught a cold?

44
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,371
That couldn't be!

45
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:10,971
I called her house, but no one answered.

46
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:13,571
And besides, she...

47
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:16,171
She told me that she wanted to ask us to do something,

48
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,571
so to please bring everyone along too

49
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:20,071
and go home together no matter what!

50
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,771
Everybody? You mean the Youth Detective Squad?

51
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:24,871
Yes.

52
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:27,571
She said she'd let me know the details on the way home.

53
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,571
She sounded really troubled and concerned.

54
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:34,571
What is her name and what is she like?

55
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:38,471
She's in 4th grade, Class A. Her name is Shoko Amemiya

56
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,071
and she has brown hair.

57
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,271
Brown hair?

58
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,871
That is a bit curly.

59
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,771
A bob cut.

60
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:46,971
Yes.

61
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,771
She looked a lot like Haibara!

62
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,571
It can't be...

63
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:06,271
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

64
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,671
Hi! Did you finish cleaning up?

65
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,171
Ms. Kobayashi...

66
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,271
Oh, boy.

67
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,271
And?

68
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,671
What's the school side saying?

69
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:20,871
Were they contacted by her family?

70
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,671
Well...

71
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,571
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:28,171
It's about Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade Class A.

73
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:30,771
Oh, Shoko Amemiya.

74
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:34,671
She was scheduled to be absent to begin with today.

75
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:37,471
She has to attend a funeral for an uncle who lives in Kyushu.

76
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,671
But on her way home yesterday,

77
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:43,371
she said that she was coming to school today and won't be absent.

78
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:46,371
So I was worried, too.

79
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:50,271
Maybe she changed her mind and decided to go today after all.

80
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,671
Her homeroom teacher, Mr. Hirayama,

81
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:55,371
was also saying that he thinks so, too.

82
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,171
Mr. Hirayama?

83
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,071
Was there a teacher by that name?

84
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,371
I never heard of him.

85
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:06,771
It's no wonder you don't know him because he's still new.

86
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,771
He came in place of the teacher that got into a traffic accident.

87
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,771
Traffic accident?

88
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:16,771
Well, I guess she'll be addressing all of you

89
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,471
this coming Monday during morning assembly.

90
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,571
Ms. Kobayashi.

91
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,271
When did that traffic accident happen?

92
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,571
This past Monday.

93
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:28,571
Two days after their attempted assassination incident.

94
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:33,471
Were you able to get in touch with her parents who went to Kyushu?

95
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,871
I'm sure we'll be able to soon.

96
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,171
We made a call to the home in Kyushu

97
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:41,571
and the people there told us that her family should be arriving by sundown.

98
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,571
Okay, I'm going to lock up,

99
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,671
so you children go on home.

100
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,771
Okay, will do...

101
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,171
After we stop off at 4th grade class A.

102
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,271
Even a dorky cap like this

103
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:36,371
looks nice when a really cute girl wears it. See.

104
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:38,671
Give it back to me!

105
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:40,871
Let's see...

106
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:43,071
So putting together the opinion of the class,

107
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,771
Shoko Amemiya is smart, good in all subjects, reticent and calm.

108
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,671
On the other hand, when the time comes when she needs to say something,

109
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,571
she is straightforward.

110
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,071
Although she is thought by some boys to be distasteful,

111
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,171
she was quite popular with girls.

112
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,471
She sounds just like Ai!

113
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:03,371
But in Haibara's case, she's also popular among boys.

114
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:04,471
Thank you.

115
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:05,471
Not at all.

116
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,571
By the way, Haibara,

117
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,171
why were you wearing a cap?

118
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,071
That's Conan's cap, isn't it?

119
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:19,071
It's good sometimes, don't you think?

120
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,571
Yes, very boyish!

121
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:22,971
It looks awesome!

122
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:28,771
What I'm asking is why are you wearing Conan's cap, Haibara?

123
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:32,071
Is there some kind of regulation that says she can't wear Conan's cap?

124
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,371
Well...

125
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:38,771
If that girl had the same kind of personality as Ai,

126
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:39,971
it's very unlikely that she would've been deceived by a weirdo

127
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:42,171
and kidnapped.

128
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,371
The possibilities remaining

129
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,971
are that she got involved in some sort of accident or maybe...

130
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:49,271
The new teacher that came is one of their members

131
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:52,071
and abducted her after mistaking her for me.

132
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:55,371
Idiot! Not much time has passed since then.

133
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:57,071
They're working too fast.

134
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,271
It's pretty slow for those people

135
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,371
if they figured out

136
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:05,871
that you're the one who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

137
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:07,371
Besides, this cap

138
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:11,671
is a protection in case that's what happened, isn't it?

139
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,071
Yeah. But if so,

140
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,171
why would it be the 4th grade homeroom teacher?

141
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,771
True. It is quite strange.

142
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:19,971
If it were them,

143
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:22,971
they would probably come directly into class.

144
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,171
But what bothers me

145
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,771
is her suspicious actions these past few days.

146
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:28,971
Yeah.

147
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:33,171
She seems to have avoided her friends after school and walked home alone.

148
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:37,871
Her friends say that she never told them the reason either.

149
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:42,371
Maybe she sensed some kind of danger.

150
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,971
No way.

151
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:47,171
If she did feel that someone was after her,

152
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,671
the more she would've stuck around her parents and friends.

153
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,171
She would've gone to Kyushu, too.

154
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,871
Yes. That's true.

155
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,771
It would be a different story

156
00:09:56,771 --> 00:10:02,071
if she's the type that would keep all her worries to herself though.

157
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,971
Like somebody I know.

158
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,571
Talk for yourself.

159
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,271
Haibara!

160
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,171
Conan!

161
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,571
This way, this way!

162
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,871
"Amemiya"

163
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:17,571
This is Shoko Amemiya's house.

164
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:21,571
There were no traces of an accident here either.

165
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,771
I wonder where she went?

166
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:28,071
Maybe she's playing hooky and playing TV games at home?

167
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:30,571
She's alone at home today, right?

168
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,571
No one seems to be home.

169
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,271
I think we can get inside.

170
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,871
I came here before,

171
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,071
and saw where the key is hidden!

172
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:53,971
I found it.

173
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,971
I don't think we should...

174
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:59,771
Yeah, we shouldn't go inside without permission.

175
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,871
Please excuse me.

176
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,471
This is Mitsuhiko.

177
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:07,071
I'm not a thief.

178
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,371
Hello!

179
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,671
Nobody home?

180
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,071
I'm coming in.

181
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:22,471
Is it the girl to the very right?

182
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,871
Yes, that's right!

183
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,171
True!

184
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:28,271
She does look a little like Ai.

185
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,471
Talking about alike,

186
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:32,971
I think there was one other thing she had in common with Haibara.

187
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:37,071
Don't tell me that her voice resembled Haibara's, too?

188
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,371
Oh, no.

189
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:40,171
Her voice didn't sound like Haibara's,

190
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,971
nor did she make sarcastic remarks.

191
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,571
Well, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:51,271
Maybe she came home!

193
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,171
Who are you all?

194
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:05,871
Who are you?

195
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:12,471
I'm Shoko Amemiya's teacher at Teitan Elementary School.

196
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:13,871
My name is Bungo Hirayama.

197
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:15,071
I see.

198
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,471
You're her teacher.

199
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:18,271
You scared us out of our wits!

200
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,971
Huh? You have a wound by your right eye.

201
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:26,971
Yeah, I fell off the stairs this morning.

202
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,871
Your glasses are out of place.

203
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:34,171
The hinges of these glasses are broken.

204
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,771
I wonder if we can really rely on this teacher.

205
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:39,771
By the way, who are you children?

206
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,571
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

207
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,571
We're students at Teitan Elementary where you teach!

208
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,271
We're in 1st grade, Class B!

209
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,071
But what are you all doing here?

210
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:56,671
We're doing the same thing as you, Mr. Hirayama.

211
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,871
We got worried about her and came to look for her.

212
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:02,671
You know, Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade.

213
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,571
I knew where the house key was,

214
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:11,171
so we came inside on our own to confirm whether she was home.

215
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:12,271
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:14,671
But nobody's home.

217
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,071
I see.

218
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:18,871
Then maybe she went to Kyushu after all.

219
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:23,671
Did Shoko say she was going to stay here alone today?

220
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:24,971
Yeah.

221
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,471
But she mentioned yesterday that she was going to eat breakfast and dinner

222
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,271
at her neighbour, Mitsuike's house.

223
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,171
Then I'm sure she's there!

224
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:35,571
Okay, let's go then.

225
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,571
Let's go!

226
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:37,871
-Genta, wait. -Wait.

227
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:38,971
To Mrs. Mitsuike's house.

228
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:00,898
Shoko Amemiya didn't come?

229
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,798
No, she's coming over tonight.

230
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:05,898
I saw her heading off for school early this morning

231
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:07,898
with her school bag on her back.

232
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,398
It's an incident after all!

233
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:10,898
What shall we do?

234
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,998
Is something the matter with Shoko?

235
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:16,598
Shoko Amemiya didn't come to school today.

236
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:20,398
Didn't you get a call from school?

237
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:21,798
Well...

238
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:24,898
I went out shopping with some women in this neighbourhood

239
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,598
and just got home a while ago.

240
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:31,898
Besides, my husband is at work so nobody was home.

241
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,698
That's why I'm not sure if the school called or not.

242
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,598
But it really bothers me.

243
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:40,898
Shoko's family is in Kyushu to attend her grandfather's funeral.

244
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:43,598
I wonder why only she decided to stay behind

245
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:47,098
and have Mrs. Mitsuike take care of her.

246
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,998
I'm not sure. I don't know why,

247
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:53,598
but it seemed that she cried and begged her parents

248
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:55,898
saying that she didn't want to go.

249
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,798
Cried...

250
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:59,498
When I saw her this morning,

251
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,098
it looked like she didn't have much sleep, too.

252
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,298
Maybe she got into a fight with her parents?

253
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:07,298
Did you notice anything else then?

254
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:09,298
Something aside from the usual.

255
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:13,298
Well, I called out to her and said, "You're going out early today."

256
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:17,098
Then she answered, "I'm going to the convenience store on the corner."

257
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,698
Convenience store?

258
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:21,798
She got into a fight with her parents and left home after all!

259
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:22,998
I see.

260
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,198
She wanted to get food at the convenience store!

261
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,598
Oh, no.

262
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:31,298
But she doesn't look like a student who would run away from home.

263
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,898
Who are you?

264
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,398
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:38,398
I'm Mr. Hirayama, Shoko Amemiya's homeroom teacher.

266
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,998
Oh, the new teacher.

267
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:42,898
Yes, I'm just substituting

268
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:46,498
until the teacher who got into a traffic accident recovers though.

269
00:15:46,498 --> 00:15:50,098
If 30 minutes go by and you get no contact from me,

270
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,298
please call the police!

271
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,898
I promise I'll find her!

272
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:59,198
Who are you?

273
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:00,498
Conan Edogawa.

274
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:03,598
We're the Youth Detective Squad...

275
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:04,598
Here we go!

276
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:05,798
Yeah...

277
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:11,798
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

278
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,098
I'm not sure.

279
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,198
I just started working here as the manager just the other day,

280
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,198
so I don't know the names and faces of the children in this neighbourhood.

281
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,098
I can show you how she looks like.

282
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,798
She looks like this!

283
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,898
This girl came early in the morning!

284
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:31,298
-Really? -Really?

285
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:34,398
Mitsuhiko, when did you take a picture like that?

286
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,998
When we went into her house a while ago.

287
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:41,298
I took a picture at the front entrance with this cell phone!

288
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,398
And? Do you remember what she bought?

289
00:16:44,398 --> 00:16:45,898
I think it was...

290
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:48,698
A plastic bottle of fruit juice,

291
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:50,798
a carton of milk,

292
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:54,398
and a small carry around cutter knife.

293
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:57,298
Juice, milk and a cutter knife?

294
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,598
She'll get hungry buying only things to drink, won't she?

295
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,298
I wonder if she was planning to make something at school

296
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,798
because she also bought a cutter knife?

297
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,298
Well, now we know that she wasn't planning to run away from home.

298
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:13,298
Anything else that bothered you about her?

299
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:16,498
Well, come to think of it,

300
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:21,498
she was at the kitchen goods corner for a while.

301
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,298
I asked her, "Are you looking for something?"

302
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:27,698
But she didn't say anything and left to go to another corner.

303
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:34,798
What was she going to buy?

304
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,898
Maybe toothpicks?

305
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:40,598
Dad always tells me to go buy some.

306
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:44,098
It's not something you buy before going to school!

307
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:47,498
I mean she's not going to school with a toothpick in her mouth, right?

308
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:51,398
If it's about that girl, I told those children about her a while ago.

309
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:52,998
I see.

310
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:56,498
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

311
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:01,498
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

312
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,598
but the instant we walked away,

313
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:06,098
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

314
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:08,298
Yeah. I guess so.

315
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:10,398
What do you mean, "I guess so"?

316
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:14,098
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

317
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,598
Oh, my!

318
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,798
It's you guys!

319
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,698
Officer Yumi!

320
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:23,898
The lady that rides the mini police motorbike!

321
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,198
What are you all doing here?

322
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:28,498
Your house is way on the other side, right?

323
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:32,598
I see.

324
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:36,598
Before Shoko Amemiya's whereabouts became unknown,

325
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:40,498
the last place she stopped over at was this convenience store.

326
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:44,498
Yep. Did you get any reports at the police

327
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,498
of suspicious people or a traffic accident?

328
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:50,998
We didn't get even one today yet.

329
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,898
But we did get a load of reports of illegal parking.

330
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,498
What's illegal parking?

331
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:57,098
People parking their cars and motorbikes

332
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:59,098
in places they're not supposed to park.

333
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:00,798
It's a bad thing to do!

334
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,398
I'm on my way to check on illegal parking.

335
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:06,298
Then why did you stop over at this convenience store?

336
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,998
Did you get hungry?

337
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,298
No!

338
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,598
I came to buy a mask!

339
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,398
Do you have a cold, Officer Yumi?

340
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:19,298
I have to go to three place now,

341
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:21,698
but all three places require me to wear masks.

342
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:24,298
Does it smell terrible or something?

343
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:25,998
Yes, in two of the places.

344
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,498
They're near a trash dump.

345
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:29,698
There are people who threw their garbage

346
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:31,898
regardless of what day of the week it is

347
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:34,798
and it's become a feeding place for crows.

348
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,798
The smell of the garbage

349
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,598
that the crows have scavenged is so stink and smelly

350
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:42,798
that it's probably better to give a ticket for illegal disposing of trash

351
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,298
before issuing a ticket for illegal parking.

352
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,098
What about the other two places?

353
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:48,498
The second place is a warehouse,

354
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:50,898
and I don't know if it's the dust or what,

355
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,598
but every time I go there I can't stop sneezing.

356
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:57,298
I went there yesterday too, but ended up with a runny nose.

357
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,298
When I went there before I was just fine though.

358
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,698
And the other place?

359
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:06,798
It's near the house where my ex-boyfriend in my university days lives.

360
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,498
I really don't want to see him

361
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,298
because I sort of brushed him off in a ruthless way.

362
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,198
You're going to cover your face with the mask?

363
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,898
Was he such a bad person?

364
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,198
No, he was pretty handsome,

365
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:20,798
but too childish.

366
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,498
Who cares about my ex-boyfriend at a time like this?

367
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:28,498
You're the one who started talking about him.

368
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:33,498
Well, those three places have Pachinko parlours and game centres nearby,

369
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,898
so many customers who could not park their cars and motorbikes

370
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:39,098
in the parking lot park their vehicles on the street!

371
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:40,598
Do you guys understand?

372
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:41,798
Yes...

373
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:44,098
The problem for now

374
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,498
is the girl whose whereabouts is unknown.

375
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:50,998
Will you please contact the police department and check one more time

376
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:53,698
whether there was an accident or something like that.

377
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:54,698
Okay.

378
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:07,398
There are no traffic accidents in this vicinity here after all.

379
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,098
Then I wonder where she went.

380
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:11,798
Ai, do you have any idea?

381
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:18,698
If she was like you, maybe you can tell where she went.

382
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:19,998
I wonder...

383
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,598
Come to think of it, Mitsuhiko you said

384
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:26,398
that the girl and Haibara had one more thing in common?

385
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:31,198
I'm trying to remember really hard what it was too, but...

386
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:33,498
You're eating at a time like this?

387
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,098
What's the big deal?

388
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,598
I used my head, so I got hungry.

389
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:45,098
Oh, that's right.

390
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,798
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

391
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:51,698
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

392
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:53,298
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

393
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:57,998
She must've been really thirsty.

394
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:00,298
But the store's near her house.

395
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:05,998
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

396
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:10,198
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

397
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,898
Her personality resembles Haibara.

398
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,098
Maybe...

399
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,680
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,500
"Predisposed to allergy"

401
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,220
What kind of allergy do you have, Genta?
