1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,740
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,140
A very strange message.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,040
The trick is solved and the killer is determined.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,690
Like always, keeping Sonoko company in her search for men,

10
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,790
we all come to the skating rink at Tropical Land.

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,990
And we meet five members of the Clay shooting club and get acquainted.

12
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,590
While we're all waiting for the fireworks to go up,

13
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,790
Sonoko's scream is heard from the toilet.

14
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,890
I run over to there, what awaited me was...

15
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,390
the dead body of Chizu Itami,

16
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,890
who is shot to death in the chest.

17
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,790
Since the letter "S" written in blood is left near the corpse,

18
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,890
Pops deduces that the killer is Izumi Sano

19
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,090
who has the letter "S" stands for her last name, but...

20
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,890
I don't think so!

21
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,290
Why?

22
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,090
I think you can tell just by looking,

23
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,090
the victim has been shot in the chest

24
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,890
and has died on the spot.

25
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,990
Therefore, it's impossible for her to write a message on the wall

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,290
after she was shot.

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,290
Moreover, the letters "KIX" were registered

28
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,290
in the cellular phone of the victim.

29
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,990
KIX?

30
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,490
Wait a second.

31
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,890
I have seen this from somewhere before.

32
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,690
"Dying Message Revives (Part 2)"

33
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,890
KIX?

34
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,690
I'm sure I have seen it somewhere.

35
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,190
Officer! May I at least change shoes?

36
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,090
We came straight from the rink.

37
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,990
If you let an officer escort you, that would be no problem.

38
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,090
But please make sure you come right back.

39
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,290
Hey, Officer Chiba, will you please escort them?

40
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,290
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,990
Come on, don't cry, Yoriko.

42
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,590
"Yoriko Komatsu (30), Izumi Sano (28)" -But Chizu...

43
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,390
"Kunitomo Orita (29), Yasuharu Misawa (29)"

44
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,090
You know, Yoriko?

45
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,290
I'm sure the officers will find the killer!

46
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,590
Stupid.

47
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,290
What?

48
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,790
That cellular phone that you have

49
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,790
is the same as the one the lady that was killed had!

50
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,190
Don't tell me this kid...

51
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,990
You're suspecting me, right?

52
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,190
-What? -No!

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,090
I just want to have a look at your cellular phone.

54
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,090
May I?

55
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,490
Here.

56
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,990
Come on, Conan.

57
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,490
You shouldn't be fooling around with it!

58
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,790
The sound of the fireworks you heard,

59
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,890
was it really the sound of fireworks?

60
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,690
Yes, of course!

61
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,690
A whistle, and then an explosion.

62
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,890
What? Did you change your cellular phone, Sonoko?

63
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,190
Yes, well sort of...

64
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,190
"Locker Room"

65
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,990
I've more or less figured out the trick,

66
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,390
but anybody could've committed the murder.

67
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,390
In order to figure out who did it...

68
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,890
Yoriko, pull yourself together.

69
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,290
I just happened to remember that incident.

70
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,090
Yoriko.

71
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,890
I envy you, Izumi.

72
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,090
You weren't at Clay shooting when that accident happened.

73
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,590
I was sick in bed on that day, remember?

74
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,990
I wish you wouldn't call that lucky.

75
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,290
I'm quitting Clay shooting as of today.

76
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,090
I can't help feeling that there is a curse.

77
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Besides, I don't want to die because of the gun accidentally going off,

78
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,190
like what happened to Narita.

79
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,290
Hey, enough of all the small talk.

80
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,290
Let's start back.

81
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,790
Yes.

82
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,790
I get it, so that's what it was!

83
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,190
That's why he was always left out!

84
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,590
But, I've still got no proof.

85
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,890
I couldn't possibly corner the killer with that message alone.

86
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,390
Two black dots...

87
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,890
Don't tell me that...

88
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,490
What's wrong?

89
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,690
Hey...

90
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,490
Conan?

91
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,990
It can't be.

92
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,990
Don't tell me that...

93
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,590
Don't tell me that...

94
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,990
Hey!

95
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,490
There it is!

96
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,490
This is it!

97
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,390
I've found it! I've found conclusive evidence!

98
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,790
With this, I can corner the killer!

99
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,990
Just what are you doing here?

100
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,290
Gosh! Forever using the scene of the crime as a playground.

101
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,090
Inspector Megure!

102
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,090
This coat thought to be that of the killer was found in the trash can

103
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,390
that is located between the skating rink and the toilet.

104
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,990
Okay, verify it with Sonoko who witnessed the killer!

105
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,990
Yes, sir! Okay!

106
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,890
Excuse me!

107
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,790
Everyone, wait!

108
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,890
Where are you all going?

109
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,290
We're going to return the skates.

110
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,190
You can question us after that, can't you?

111
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,390
We've all got alibis that we were watching the fireworks

112
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,490
at the time of the crime.

113
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,890
Yes, the alibis of everyone

114
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,190
except Orita who's not interested in fireworks.

115
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,090
I'm sure glad I watched the fireworks.

116
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,890
If I didn't watch it as usual,

117
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,890
I would've been suspected too.

118
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,690
Izumi!

119
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,390
It's true, isn't it?

120
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,390
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep with the anesthesia gun first.

121
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,890
Let's not play games anymore.

122
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,890
Let's get things straight,

123
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,590
since the answer is already obvious.

124
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,990
No way, Pops...

125
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,190
Have you figured out who the killer is?

126
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,990
Yes, this time for sure.

127
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,790
The one who waited for Mr. Chizu in the toilet

128
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,790
and killed her with the shotgun is...

129
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,290
It's...

130
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,990
Mr. Kunitomo Orita!

131
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,490
It's you!

132
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,490
What? No way!

133
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,090
Hey... Hold it! I...

134
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,690
You ran into the wrong guy.

135
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,690
You may have tried to leaving a dying message

136
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,690
written in blood near the victim,

137
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,590
but you couldn't fool me!

138
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,990
You were completely deceived, weren't you?

139
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,190
That letter was written by you after you killed her!

140
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,790
A person who was shot in the chest and died on the spot

141
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,290
couldn't possibly have written it.

142
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,590
And, the comment that Ms. Izumi Sano made just now,

143
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,490
brought everything to light.

144
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,390
That the killer had calculated on framing Ms. Sano up as the killer

145
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,190
by committing the crime when the fireworks go up

146
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,690
so that Ms. Sano, who usually does not watch the performance

147
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,990
ends up without an alibi.

148
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,290
The letter "S" from her name was used

149
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:55,090
as well as her gun for this reason!

150
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,890
However, she unfortunately decides to watch the fireworks.

151
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,290
So, you end up being the one without an alibi.

152
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,190
Your scheme collapsed, all in vain...

153
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,290
As a result,

154
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,290
the killer lead us to believe that Mr. Orita was the killer

155
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,690
and successfully was removed from the the list of suspects.

156
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,790
This indeed was what the killer was after.

157
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,490
Then, who on earth is the killer?

158
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,590
The one who killed Mr. Chizu Itami is,

159
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,390
leaving Mr. Orita aside,

160
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,290
one of the members of the Clay shooting club

161
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,290
is you!

162
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,480
The killer is, leaving Mr. Orita aside,

163
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,880
one of the members of the Clay shooting club

164
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,480
is you!

165
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,580
Izumi Sano!

166
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,180
Izumi?

167
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,580
Yes, you used your own gun

168
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,780
and left that letter written with blood in order to mislead us.

169
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,380
A killer would never leave his own shotgun

170
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,780
or an initial pointing to him at the scene of the crime.

171
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,880
You took advantage of this psychology and set a trap!

172
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,380
You moved the mouth of the gun from her mouth down to her chest

173
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,480
because you wanted the letter written in blood to look real.

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
A person who is shot in the head

175
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,980
would never be able to write on the wall.

176
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,280
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,080
I was watching the fireworks with Ran from the very beginning.

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,080
If the murder was committed when the fireworks went up,

179
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,180
I would've been impossible for me to carry it out!

180
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,580
That is, if the murder was really committed

181
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,180
when the fireworks went up.

182
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,080
Will you cut it out?

183
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Don't you remember what Sonoko said?

184
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,580
That when the fireworks went up,

185
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,880
the killer was still in the toilet!

186
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,880
No! The sound that Sonoko heard was not the sound of the fireworks,

187
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,580
but rather the sound of a shotgun being fired!

188
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,680
Don't be ridiculous! There's no way

189
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,680
a person can mistake the sound of a shotgun for a fireworks...

190
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,180
What do you think? Did that sound like fireworks?

191
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,180
Yes. But how did you do it?

192
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,880
This, with this!

193
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,380
A five yen coin?

194
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,880
She puts it between her lips and whistles.

195
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,280
The sound gets loud and hoarse,

196
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,480
and sounds like that of fireworks!

197
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,980
It did kind of sound something like that.

198
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,680
Right, Pops?

199
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,480
If only the shotgun were used, it wouldn't sound like fireworks.

200
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
But, if one is expecting the sound of fireworks,

201
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,780
and the time of the show beginning was approaching,

202
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,380
it would be deceived under the circumstances back then.

203
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,080
As proof,

204
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,880
Sonoko mentioned that only one burst of fireworks went up then.

205
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,580
However, the fireworks actually started

206
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,580
with three successive shots of red, blue and yellow.

207
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,380
That's right, isn't it, Sonoko?

208
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,580
It was lucky that Sonoko coincidentally

209
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,880
happened to be in front of the toilet.

210
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,480
But it seems there were two or three other people there too.

211
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,980
This is the only toilet you can use wearing skates.

212
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,280
It is predictable that with the cleaning sign hung on the door,

213
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,180
one or two people will wait.

214
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,180
In other words, Ms. Sano promised to meet Ms. Chizu in the toilet.

215
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,180
She drives people away by hanging the cleaning sign at the entrance,

216
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,780
then she locks the entrance door.

217
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,080
She holds the shotgun that she had taken out of the locker,

218
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,380
and head for the toilet where Ms. Chizu was waiting.

219
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,280
Then, you pointed the gun at her

220
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,880
and wait until a minute before the fireworks were about to be set off,

221
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,980
made the sound with the five yen coin, and fired the gun.

222
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,080
After that, you wrote the letter "S" with

223
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,780
and rushed back to the rink before the real fireworks went up

224
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,780
in order to frame Mr. Orita who wouldn't have an alibi

225
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,380
because he was not interested in fireworks.

226
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,980
Hey, is that true, Izumi?

227
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,580
Izumi?

228
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,880
I guess so.

229
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
If I do so, it's true I could've committed the murder.

230
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,080
But, how can you say it was me?

231
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,880
The other three could've used the same trick too!

232
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,180
Izumi!

233
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,580
I don't know who on earth you are,

234
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,480
but will you cut out all your stupid nonsense?

235
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,180
KIX.

236
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,380
What?

237
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,880
Do you know what this means?

238
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,180
Yes, the letters that Chizu randomly input in her cellular phone.

239
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,680
No, she didn't input them randomly.

240
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,780
She probably input these letters in her cellular phone

241
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,480
while you were blocking her mouth with the gun.

242
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,080
Then she kept pressing the arrow button

243
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,480
to send out her message!

244
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,180
She hoped that we would eventually press the re-dial button

245
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,580
and find out what she did.

246
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,880
I see!

247
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,880
That's why the row for phone numbers were filled with "#" symbol!

248
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,580
Pressing on the arrow button displays the "#" symbol.

249
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,980
Hey, which means that the letters on the display of the cellular phone

250
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,680
are the real dying message?

251
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
So what?

252
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,880
Is KIX supposed to be my name or something?

253
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,180
I heard that Ms. Chizu said that

254
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,080
Mr. Orita is always left out of your group.

255
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
What are you trying to get at?

256
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,480
The name of the victim is Ms. Itami.

257
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,680
The two who are behind are Mr. Komatsu and Ms. Misawa.

258
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,080
Your name is Izumi Sano.

259
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,580
You still don't get it?

260
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,080
Would putting it this way help you then?

261
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,180
The name of your friend who died of an accident 6 months ago

262
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,380
was Mr. Narita?

263
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,380
Wait a second.

264
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,080
I get it! Airport!

265
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,180
All your names are names of where airports are located!

266
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,180
Is there an airport in Sano City, though?

267
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,180
True. Besides, I can't see how it is connected to KIX.

268
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,980
Yes, KIX is the three-letter-code

269
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,380
for the Kansai International Airport!

270
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,480
It refers to the airport

271
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,780
that is located in Izumi Sano City in Osaka.

272
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,280
Do you understand now, Ms. Izumi?

273
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,680
But that could be a message that the killer used to frame me!

274
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
If I show you this,

275
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,880
it may convince you.

276
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,280
A strange blood stain the was on the floor

277
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,880
near the victim's left toe.

278
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
What?

279
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Blood stain?

280
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,180
This is...

281
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,680
That is the trace of the blade of the skates

282
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,580
that was left behind that Ms. Sano touched.

283
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,280
After she finished writing the letter in blood,

284
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,580
she still hasn't realised that the same blood stain

285
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,480
was left on the corridor that she fled along.

286
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,880
Ms. Chizu's blood is still left on the blade of her own skates.

287
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,880
Izumi.

288
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,280
I see, the name of the location of an airport.

289
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,580
Just as would be expected of a Ms. Richie Rich

290
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,280
who is still living off her parents and traveling around.

291
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,580
Then you did kill Chizu after all, Izumi.

292
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,880
But... but why?

293
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,280
Narita.

294
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,480
What? Narita?

295
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,880
Yes, I avenged Narita's death by killing Chizu

296
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,180
who lead him to commit suicide.

297
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,780
Suicide?

298
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,180
But wasn't that supposed be an accident?

299
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,180
Narita was brushed off by Chizu that day.

300
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,580
And he pulled the trigger himself.

301
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,480
And, it was mistakenly concluded that he accidentally died

302
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,380
while he was checking his gun.

303
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,880
I told him repeatedly to forget her, and yet...

304
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
But why kill Chizu because of something like that?

305
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
If he just committed suicide because he was brushed off,

306
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,680
I wouldn't have done this!

307
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,480
I went over board

308
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
because I found out that somebody was two-timing!

309
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,180
Two-timing?

310
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,180
Yes. That day, I was sick in bed.

311
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,880
I got a call from Narita.

312
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,380
He said he's finished. That his best friend had betrayed him.

313
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,480
That Orita was going out with Chizu.

314
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,880
He sounded like he was choking in tears.

315
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,780
What? But wasn't Orita going out with you, Izumi, back then?

316
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,580
Right! This guy knew how Narita felt about Chizu,

317
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,780
and yet he had the nerve to two-timing Chizu and me, snickering at us.

318
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,680
That's not true.

319
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,780
It's a lie that she always uses to get herself out of hot water!

320
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,080
Then, why didn't you tell Narita that over the phone that day?

321
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,180
He said he asked you,

322
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,180
but you were aloof and didn't lend him an ear.

323
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,480
Yes, I know it sounds wretched,

324
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,180
but his words didn't reach me.

325
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,880
Because I was concerned about you being sick in bed that day.

326
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,880
Maybe it would've been better for me

327
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,180
to have been shot by you.

328
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,880
We'll hear the rest of your story at the station.

329
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,480
Hey.

330
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Can I trust in you?

331
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,680
No matter how long it takes

332
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,180
and how far apart we are.

333
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,580
Yes, don't worry.

334
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,780
I'm very vengeful and persistent.

335
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
Thank you.

336
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,680
Hey.

337
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,780
Can I trust you?

338
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
No matter how long it takes

339
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,780
and how far apart we are.

340
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,780
What is this?

341
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,580
A young girl acting like an old lady.

342
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,080
Will you be quiet? You don't have the slightest idea how I feel!

343
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,580
Oh, your phone is ringing.

344
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,580
Yes, hello?

345
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,880
"Seattle International Karate Championship" -I won! I won, Sonoko!

346
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
I've won the championship of the Winter Karate Tournament!

347
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,880
There sure are unimaginably strong fighters in the world...

348
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,080
You idiot!

349
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,680
Idiot...

350
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,980
Why didn't you call me sooner?

351
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,180
I sent you my phone number two months ago!

352
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,780
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,480
I didn't want to call you and have nothing to say.

354
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
You...

355
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,880
Sonoko, I hear that the cold is going around in Japan,

356
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,780
so please don't go out wearing short skirts, okay?

357
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,780
I'm not! I'm wearing something really long today too.

358
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,180
Just as I thought!

359
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,080
Sonoko seems to have bought another cellular phone just for Mr. Kyogoku.

360
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,380
I guess so.

361
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,080
A cellular phone just for two.

362
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,580
How nice...

363
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,580
"Mouri Detective Agency" -A few days later...

364
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,880
"Receiver: Ran Mouri, Sender: Shinichi Kudo"

365
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I sent Ran a cellular phone

366
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,180
as a token of my appreciation for the sweater.

367
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,880
At first, she seemed to be puzzled.

368
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,180
But she seemed happy at the same time,

369
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,680
so I guess I did the right thing.

370
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,880
"Next Episode"

371
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,580
Three people turned themselves in saying they committed the murder.

372
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,780
Accomplices?

373
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,180
There is only one victim

374
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,880
and yet there are three people saying they killed him!

375
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Very Interesting!

376
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,980
Next Conan,

377
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,900
"The Man Who Was Killed Four Times"

378
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,700
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
"Hard headed"
