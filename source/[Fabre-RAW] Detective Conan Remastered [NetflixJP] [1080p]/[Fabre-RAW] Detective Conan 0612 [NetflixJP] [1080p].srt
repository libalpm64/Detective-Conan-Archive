1
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:16,006
There was a history of calls received on Saki's cell phone

2
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,006
from the Inubushi family?

3
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:22,001
Yeah. About two hours before she fell off the cliff.

4
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,706
So the more suspicious

5
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:26,906
the remaining for adopted children are becoming.

6
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:29,806
It could be that they asked her to go out for sudden urgent shopping

7
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,406
delaying the time she comes home.

8
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,013
Then, after the surroundings get dark,

9
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,706
they made the dog attack her, you know.

10
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:42,906
Huh? Isn't it three? Miyuki has an alibi, so...

11
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,206
Miyuki is also suspicious!

12
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:46,906
If she were to make the dog attack,

13
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:49,606
she could do so even if she's with us so long

14
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,506
as she blows the dog whistle secretly.

15
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:55,306
After all, she was right below the cliff too!

16
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,037
The only one in that house that's not suspicious is

17
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,306
Satomi, who's bed-ridden!

18
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:05,106
You... how come you're acting like you're in charge of this place?

19
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,047
Are Mr. Mouri's assistant just like Conan, or what?

20
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:11,506
Well, I guess you could put it that way.

21
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,053
Like a keep saying, cut out that assistant stuff.

22
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,706
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

23
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,406
Tears are the start of all dramas.

24
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:24,063
The mystery of the footprints of the demon dog.

25
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
Engulfed in flames and the balls left behind.

26
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,506
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,506
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,071
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:17,573
A clan cursed by a dog, the Inubushi family.

30
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,273
After the previous head of the household, Tsunechika

31
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,073
passed away five years ago,

32
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:25,773
the present head of the household, Satomi is also bed-ridden.

33
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:29,173
If she dies, the eight adopted children

34
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:32,191
will inherit the vast estate of the Inubushi family,

35
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:36,473
but, they are dying bizarre deaths one after the other.

36
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:39,873
We went out to investigate the incidents,

37
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:43,573
but the fourth victim fell before our eyes.

38
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,205
Footprints of fire were found here and there

39
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,073
at the site of the crime.

40
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:53,673
Could it be that a demon dog engulfed in fire actually exists?

41
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:56,215
Are the serial killings occurring at the Inubushi residence

42
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,173
the doings of a cursed demon dog?

43
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,473
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

44
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:06,225
"(Footprints Chapter)"

45
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:09,973
He's cute.

46
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:14,233
Yes! It would be nice if the demon dog is this way too.

47
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,973
What's the matter?

48
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:29,473
What's that? Isn't something glowing over there?

49
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:30,673
Yes.

50
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,373
Kazuha!

51
00:04:57,073 --> 00:04:59,573
Stand up! The front door's right there!

52
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,673
What's all the fuss about?

53
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:12,291
The demon dog!

54
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,293
The demon dog appeared in the yard!

55
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,373
-Demon dog? -Don't be ridiculous!

56
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,773
It would never appear inside the premises of the house!

57
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:23,473
Don't tell me it jumped over the fence and came inside.

58
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:26,305
That's ridiculous.

59
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,873
At any rate, it's dangerous,

60
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:31,873
so I think that you should stay inside for a while.

61
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:34,973
Hachi's barking.

62
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:38,317
I wonder if Hachi's going to be okay?

63
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,319
We better bring Hachi here!

64
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,073
Hey, girls?

65
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,673
No matter what angle you look at it from, it's a plain marble.

66
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:52,973
A pachinko ball, ping pong ball,

67
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:56,335
a round pearl and a marble.

68
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,373
What on earth does the culprit want to say?

69
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,273
It's that, that!

70
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:03,373
A dog and balls.

71
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:09,473
Hey. None of your stupid play on words again now.

72
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:12,873
You can say whatever you like! I'm all ears.

73
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,773
It could turn out to be a hint!

74
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:21,273
No! It's stupid so I don't think so!

75
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:26,365
Hey, you! Don't hold out on us! Say it!

76
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,973
I won't ever say it!

77
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,377
It's true that there are traces of the grass having burned.

78
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,173
The rope that was tied by the edge of the cliff

79
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,873
-had been cut too. -Besides...

80
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,173
The sign has also been pulled out.

81
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,973
The road sign that was beyond the forked road

82
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:51,973
"Inubushi Residence" -was also knocked down.

83
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:56,073
I see. If chased by a dog in the dark like this

84
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:59,573
without a road sign or a rope,

85
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:04,073
it would send anyone right over the cliff!

86
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:10,409
The problem is the demon dog that attacked, right?

87
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,873
There's no such thing as a demon dog!

88
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:15,073
This is a psychological trick!

89
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:17,273
It's just being made to look as if

90
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:21,273
a demon dog exists with the story of the cursed dog in the past

91
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,673
and the fire footprints!

92
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:27,273
Fluorescent paint was probably used on the dog to make it glow!

93
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:30,773
-Fluorescent paint? -Yeah!

94
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,373
Since something that usually isn't glowing was glowing,

95
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,973
it gave the mistaken impression that something was burning!

96
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,873
Then, what about the fire footprints?

97
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,173
There was no smell of oil, was there?

98
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:44,443
Maybe the fire was set by using a gas burner or something?

99
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:47,973
What is it, Kazuha?

100
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:50,173
It's going to take us a little mover time yet,

101
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:53,773
so if you get sleepy, don't wait for us and...

102
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,273
What?

103
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,457
The demon dog appeared at the house?

104
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,473
Really? Was the dog really burning?

105
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,465
Yes.

106
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,873
-Right, Ran? -Yes!

107
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:11,673
It wasn't fluorescent paint or anything!

108
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,973
Although the fire's gone already.

109
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:17,473
There were fire footprints left where the dog went by.

110
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:22,073
True. There are burnt remains just like we saw on the cliff.

111
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:25,673
And, where did that dog come from?

112
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,073
From over that side!

113
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,491
These footprints are strange.

114
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:36,495
See, judging from the space of the footsteps,

115
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,073
there should be some around here too,

116
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,573
but there's none here at all!

117
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:44,273
Besides, the ground is messed up only over here.

118
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,573
That's the place you fell, right, Kazuha?

119
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:54,513
Yes...

120
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:59,573
and when I fell, I smelled something strange.

121
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,973
What do you mean strange?

122
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:06,525
Like rotten onions or something. It had a pungent foul smell.

123
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,527
Onions?

124
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:12,531
Oh, and after we evacuated into the house,

125
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,173
we came right out again and saw...

126
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:18,273
It looked kind of alive.

127
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:22,173
Of course! It attacked after all.

128
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:27,773
Oh, no. Not the demon dog, but the burnt footprints.

129
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:32,073
It seemed to be hopping around while making a clanking sound.

130
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,573
You saw it too, didn't you, Kazuha?

131
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,873
I did, I saw it!

132
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:40,173
It looked as though the footprints had souls in them!

133
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:42,561
It's surprising that you went outside again.

134
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:45,173
Despite the chances of the demon dog still being there.

135
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:47,973
Yes, but we were worried about Hachi!

136
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,569
We thought the demon dog might eat him.

137
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,973
I've figured out how the demon dog got inside.

138
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:57,273
The backdoor!

139
00:09:57,273 --> 00:10:00,373
The door was unlocked and opened,

140
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,073
and there were the footprints of a dog there too.

141
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:06,173
In other words, the culprit who let the demon dog in

142
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,587
through the backdoor and into the house

143
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,873
is most likely among the four of you

144
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:14,593
who were in the house at that time!

145
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:18,597
Because bed-ridden Satomi couldn't have done it.

146
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,273
Ran and Kazuha.

147
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:24,873
You said you went outside to feed Hachi,

148
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,605
but who asked you to do so?

149
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,607
Miyuki.

150
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,609
Oh, but she told us that the other three people

151
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,611
refused to feed the dog.

152
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:37,273
Maybe she knew beforehand that we'd be feeding the dog.

153
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:39,473
Well, it's certain that

154
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,073
someone is keeping the demon dog near this house.

155
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:44,273
Right.

156
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,625
If it wasn't close by, the person couldn't make the dog

157
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:50,629
attack Ran and Kazuha all of a sudden.

158
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,473
Do you have any idea who it could be?

159
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:56,635
Like you heard a dog bark in the woods or something.

160
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,637
Come to think of it.

161
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:01,873
Miwako, the second one who died had asked me

162
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:04,073
to go check a strange hut

163
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:07,273
where she heard the barking of a dog.

164
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:11,473
But, I was scared that I didn't go inside.

165
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:12,651
What?

166
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:13,973
Where is that?

167
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,657
I think it was near the swamp where Miwako drowned.

168
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,273
Take us there right away!

169
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:22,673
-Now? -If you take us now,

170
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:25,373
we may be able to figure out the demon dog trick!

171
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:27,273
True.

172
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,073
If the culprit is among somebody here,

173
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:32,473
there was no time to get rid of the evidence.

174
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:37,573
But I'm on duty tonight and have to go back to the hospital.

175
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,373
After we check the hut, I'll drive you back by car!

176
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,773
It's probably frightening to walk through the forest alone

177
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,173
and go back to the hospital besides.

178
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:49,473
But... back then, I just followed Miwako,

179
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:52,173
so I'm not sure where the swamp is.

180
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,693
I'll take you to the swamp!

181
00:11:54,693 --> 00:12:00,173
I know the forest by heart and it's not too far from here!

182
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:16,715
So, this is that swamp.

183
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:21,526
Is it true that there was fire around this swamp?

184
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:25,626
Yeah. Although it was just burned traces here and there.

185
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,126
And? Where's the hut?

186
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:31,926
Well...

187
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:36,226
Oh, there! That worn out hut is it!

188
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:40,026
Okay, so let's go raid the demon dog's nest!

189
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,626
Please watch your step!

190
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:46,426
This swamp seems to be made of quicksand.

191
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,226
Aren't you going?

192
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:54,753
Of course not! I'll wait in the car!

193
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,526
Is that so?

194
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:04,763
What the heck is this?

195
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,726
This place is packed with books on black magic!

196
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:10,769
Even a magic circle is drawn on the floor.

197
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,773
There's no mistake that someone was keeping a dog here.

198
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,775
But, who on earth could it be?

199
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:20,426
That someone cast a curse on the dog here.

200
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,726
Idiot! If people can commit murder by casting curses,

201
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:25,426
detectives will go out of business!

202
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:28,026
But, Ran and her friend say they saw...

203
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:32,791
So, like I said before that was some kind of a trick...

204
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,226
What?

205
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,817
-Don't move! -Stay still!

206
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:01,326
Are you all right?

207
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,126
He was just a little burned, that's all.

208
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:07,126
By the way, what we just saw...

209
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:10,026
Demon dog, wasn't it?

210
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:12,426
What? It came out again?

211
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:14,826
The demon dog appeared again?

212
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:18,426
Yeah. It's already the third time tonight.

213
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,226
Was the dog really on fire?

214
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,626
Isn't it some kind of a trick?

215
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,426
Yeah. We thought so too.

216
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:28,526
But no matter how you look at it...

217
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:31,526
I think it was really burning!

218
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,853
It's body was engulfed in flames.

219
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:39,526
Everywhere the dog walked, there were burning fire footprints.

220
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,859
Furthermore,

221
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,426
Tomoaki was attacked by the demon dog

222
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:46,026
and his arm was on fire, and now he has a burn.

223
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,726
Are you all right?

224
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:52,871
Yes, I used the first aid kit I had in my bag and treated it so...

225
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,873
But, I called the hospital to tell them

226
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:58,126
to find somebody else to take my place tonight.

227
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:01,626
Why did you get out of the car?

228
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:05,926
I got scared waiting by myself after all.

229
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:10,473
The question is this onion that was found

230
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:14,292
near where Tomoaki was attacked!

231
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,895
Another round thing?

232
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:19,892
What on earth are you talking about?

233
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:22,901
Come to think of it, you mentioned that

234
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,992
when you fell fleeing from the demon dog,

235
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,692
you smelled rotten onions.

236
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:34,592
Yes. Maybe the demon dog and onion is connected somehow?

237
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,592
And? Do the police have any idea

238
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:40,392
who the person manipulating that demon dog is?

239
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:43,892
I'm planning to call forensics in the morning

240
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:47,492
and check out that suspicious hut.

241
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,092
I don't think that the culprit will be caught though.

242
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,931
-What? -Why not?

243
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:57,992
Because we're up against a black magic magician, you know?

244
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,792
How could we just normal civilian officers

245
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,941
possibly stand up to somebody like that?

246
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,292
I mean I would really like to get of here

247
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,392
as soon as possible if I could!

248
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,792
Black magic?

249
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,192
We found it in the hut!

250
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,953
A whole lot of those books.

251
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,692
I'd like to ask you just in case.

252
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,592
At the time we encountered the demon dog,

253
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:24,092
all of you were in the house, correct?

254
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:26,292
I was on the phone right through

255
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,992
making arrangements for Saki's funeral.

256
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,692
I was chatting on the computer with my survival game friends.

257
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,973
Survival game? That survival thing?

258
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:40,392
Yeah. I'm an instructor at a camp nearby.

259
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:44,092
And I play the survival game with my friends once a month!

260
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:48,092
Then, you must know this forest pretty well too.

261
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,492
I guess so.

262
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,892
But, I'm not as good as Miyuki

263
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,792
who used to go pick mountain vegetables together with Satomi.

264
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,792
And, is Satomi still doing the same?

265
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:03,001
Yes. She was asleep in her room.

266
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,892
Oh, come to think of it, where are Heiji and Conan?

267
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:10,592
I haven't seen them for a while.

268
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:15,013
I'll bet they were shocked that they're dazed out somewhere.

269
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:17,892
They believed that the demon dog was a trick

270
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,792
and yet they saw it with their own eyes, you see.

271
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,492
Oh, there they are!

272
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,092
They really looked dazed out.

273
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,192
Let's just forget all the bad stuff!

274
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:35,492
Right! Right! In this world there are strange things

275
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:39,037
that you just can't understand no matter how hard you try!

276
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,892
Strange things that you just can't understand?

277
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:45,043
Just what are you talking about?

278
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,045
You know, like the demon dog!

279
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,492
You guys saw too, didn't you Heiji? The monster on fire!

280
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:54,592
Dad also said that he saw footprints of fire left behind too.

281
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:55,592
Yeah.

282
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,092
As for the trick of the footprints of fire,

283
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:02,392
from what you said about the smell of rotten onions when you fell...

284
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:04,392
And right after the demon dog disappeared,

285
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:06,492
what you said about seeing a thing on fire hopping around

286
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,992
with a clanking sound,

287
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:10,592
we figured out approximately what happened!

288
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:12,292
What?

289
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,892
The footprints of fire were always about 20m.

290
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:19,592
There were traces of something being dragged along too!

291
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:23,092
But, the thing I had to really rack my brains to figure out

292
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:26,092
-was the burning body. -Yeah.

293
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,292
How the culprit engulfed the dog's body in flames

294
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,192
so that the dog would pounce on Tomoaki

295
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,492
and injure him with burns with the attack?

296
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:36,192
If the dog were wrapped with a cloth and really set fire to,

297
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:39,792
there should be the burnt remains of a dog nearby.

298
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,392
If the culprit used an extinguisher or something

299
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,092
to put the fire out,

300
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,992
the equipment used should be nearby too.

301
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,692
If the culprit waited in the car for the dog to come back

302
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,592
and extinguished the fire on the bed of the car or something,

303
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,992
there should be traces of that left behind too.

304
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,192
There were no traces of tire marks nearby

305
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,792
nor any sound of an engine running.

306
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,119
Where did the dog disappear to in the first place?

307
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,123
If it were burning, when we ran over to Tomoaki,

308
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,392
we should've seen it somewhere.

309
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:10,092
The dog wasn't around?

310
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:14,292
No. It's as if it were swallowed by the darkness.

311
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:15,592
Swallowed?

312
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:18,192
Are you saying it was swallowed by the dark?

313
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,692
-Wanna eat? -What?

314
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,892
Eat?

315
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,592
Oh, I'm talking about dinner.

316
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:27,992
Would you like me to reheat it if you're going to eat?

317
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,392
-I'll eat! -I'm starved!

318
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:31,892
I'll get to it right away, then.

319
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:34,592
Oh, I want to ask you something.

320
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:36,592
Do you have something that crosses your mind

321
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,192
when you think of round things or balls?

322
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,157
Round balls?

323
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,159
The culprit is always leaving round balls

324
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,161
back at the scene of the crime, right?

325
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:47,892
The Inubushi family and round balls, is there a connection?

326
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,092
The thing that comes to mind

327
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:51,992
when I think of the word "tama" (ball)

328
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:56,092
is my original last name Tamaki.

329
00:19:57,392 --> 00:20:00,392
My nickname when I was a child was also Tama-chan.

330
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:02,192
Tama-chan?

331
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:05,183
But just because of that, don't say that I'm the culprit, now!

332
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:08,592
I'm not called by that nickname here either so...

333
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:11,189
Do you know the last name of all the others?

334
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:15,892
No. I'm the last one who was adopted and came here.

335
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:18,792
Come to think of it, you're much younger

336
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,592
than anybody else here, no?

337
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:24,092
Yes. It seems that I came here

338
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:27,205
when my father Chairman Tsunechika was in his mid 50's.

339
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,592
As for my name, at first,

340
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,292
one kanji character was taken from my father's name,

341
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:31,992
and Chikae was supposed to be my name.

342
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:34,792
But mother didn't like it, so I got my present name.

343
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,215
Mother used to hate father.

344
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,492
She used to say she was deceived by a rich man

345
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:39,792
and then disposed of.

346
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,492
Then why did you come here?

347
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,492
You must've hated it if all she did was complain to you.

348
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:50,992
To be honest, I had no intention of coming here either.

349
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:54,392
But, a while after my mother fell ill and passed away,

350
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,235
I received a letter from my father.

351
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:00,292
-A letter? -It said, I'm not doing well.

352
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,792
If you're going to forgive me,

353
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:06,492
come to the Inubushi family and protect the princess for me.

354
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:11,249
The others seem to have received a similar kind of letter too.

355
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,792
-Princess... -Who is it about?

356
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:17,255
Isn't it about Miyuki?

357
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,792
Because she has a kanji character in her name that reads "princess".

358
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,992
Idiot! Who'd send a letter to the princess herself

359
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:24,692
asking her to protect the princess?

360
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,492
I didn't know who it was about at first either,

361
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:30,192
but after coming here, I found out

362
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,592
it was about Mother Satomi right away!

363
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:37,275
After all, all the helpers were calling her princess.

364
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,692
Why was she called princess?

365
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:42,892
I was told that father used to always call her that way.

366
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:45,292
Mother used to laugh and tell him to stop

367
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,285
because it embarrassed her.

368
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:51,592
Could it be because this house looks like a castle?

369
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:53,292
That's right.

370
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,892
I'm sure that Chairman Tsunechika felt like a King himself!

371
00:21:56,892 --> 00:22:00,792
My name is written using the kanji character "kou" which mean happiness

372
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,192
and read "Miyuki"

373
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:03,301
but mother recommended that

374
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:05,303
I add the kanji character "princess" to my name.

375
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,592
It isn't read "hime" (princess) to begin with anyway.

376
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,307
Did you change your name?

377
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:13,092
Yes. Mother told me, "Let's both be "princess" together

378
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:16,192
and live in this castle smiling all the time.

379
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,092
Oh.

380
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:20,192
Talking about names.

381
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:23,321
There's a strange story regarding our names.

382
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:26,192
About your names?

383
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:30,192
The culprit is among the remaining adopted children.

384
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:33,331
Who on earth is the culprit that's manipulating

385
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:37,335
the burning demon dog and killing the adopted children

386
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,592
of the Inubushi family one after the other?

387
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,012
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:05,423
"Japanese Rosary"

389
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,425
Bite the burning dog!

390
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,898
What? How scary.

391
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,640
-Like hot dog. -Hold on.
