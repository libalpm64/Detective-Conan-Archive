1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:05,229
The serial car thefts

2
00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:09,629
that Yumi of the Metropolitan Police Department had named as such,

3
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:12,229
was a malicious case in which the key was tampered with,

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,829
the car then broken into and the word "Die" was written

5
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:17,429
on the ceiling of the car.

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,729
Officer Chiba's car was also attacked,

7
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,829
and the new policewoman, Naeko Miike, who came along with Yumi

8
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,129
after they were contacted about the incident,

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,029
turned out to be Officer Chiba's first love.

10
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,429
There was a time when we looked for

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,329
a video that she was shown on at Teitan Elementary School,

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,829
together with Officer Chiba in the past.

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,529
It seems that Officer Chiba was totally oblivious to the fact

14
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,229
that the woman officer in front of him was his first love.

15
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:48,829
So, we thought up a plan to make Officer Chiba and Naeko

16
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:51,929
investigate the car theft case together.

17
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,829
If they both work together,

18
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,329
he would most likely remember her.

19
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,229
But, in the basement parking lot that they were investigating,

20
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,229
there was a car collision.

21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,729
Moreover, the word "Die" was written with red spray paint

22
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,329
on the inside of the windshield of the car that was hit.

23
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,329
Don't tell me that this was also the work of the serial car thief.

24
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,929
Three people were in the parking lot at the time the accident happened.

25
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:19,429
The person who was driving the car that was hit,

26
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:22,129
Mr. Akitoshi Fukuchi, an office worker.

27
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,529
Mrs. Noriko Shigei, a housewife who was driving the car that collided,

28
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:31,429
and free-lancer, Mr. Takero Nawa who was waiting for his friend to come.

29
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:34,129
Is the car thief and person who caused the collision

30
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,729
among the three?

31
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,729
If all cases were men,

32
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,629
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

33
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,329
The culprit and your first lover.

34
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,329
You've got two things to figure out, Officer Chiba.

35
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,929
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:07,929
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,829
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:37,984
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 2)".

39
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,684
I'd like to make a declaration.

40
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:47,284
As a result of careful investigation...

41
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:51,284
There was no one other than you three, after all!

42
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:55,284
This means that the culprit is among you, right?

43
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,484
No.

44
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,784
Why am I, who was hit from behind

45
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,784
also included as one of the suspects?

46
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,384
Why not?

47
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:04,684
There's a possibility that you deliberately hit the car,

48
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:08,684
and passed out, making it look as if you were the victim.

49
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:10,984
"Akitoshi Fukuchi (41), Office worker" -Give me a break!

50
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,984
My wife and daughter are waiting for me to come home.

51
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,084
"Noriko Shigei (36), Housewife" -Same here,

52
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:18,184
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

53
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:19,884
"Takero Nawa (22), Free-lancer" -I got to hurry home too,

54
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,584
or my parents will get on my back.

55
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:24,084
Don't tell me, you give a hoot about your parents?

56
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,784
Yeah. They happen to be school teachers, you know.

57
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,684
And, they didn't say anything

58
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:32,684
about that flashy wing on your car?

59
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:35,484
It doesn't look like your car passed the safety check, does it?

60
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,584
No, they haven't seen it.

61
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,184
Come to think of it,

62
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:44,184
there was a wing on the third car that was attacked, right?

63
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,584
Yes.

64
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,984
But, your car wasn't attacked, was it?

65
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,484
I wonder why.

66
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:51,784
How should I know?

67
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:57,584
The wing on your car is much flashier

68
00:04:57,584 --> 00:05:01,084
and the position of the wing is higher too.

69
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,884
If you check the car that was attacked in more detail,

70
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:05,684
maybe you'll find something more.

71
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:06,784
If so,

72
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,584
would you like to look at the pictures taken from a different angle too?

73
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,284
I brought it along in my mini patrol car that's parked outside.

74
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:14,384
I'll go get it then!

75
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:15,784
Thank you!

76
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:19,584
Hey, Officer Chiba, don't you have to go with her?

77
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,584
Why?

78
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,184
If there are a lot of pictures,

79
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,984
it'll be tough bringing them all here, right?

80
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:27,384
It's the duty of men to help women!

81
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:30,084
-Come on. -Go on, hurry!

82
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:05,384
What's with you guys staring into each other's eyes

83
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,284
like in some romantic move?

84
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,684
Go on,

85
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,784
hurry and go take pictures.

86
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,084
Yes!

87
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:18,784
I wish you wouldn't go giving the eye to new-comers.

88
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:21,084
Giving the eye?

89
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:25,084
I think it's best that we explain things to her.

90
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,284
You can say that again.

91
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:28,584
Oh, boy.

92
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,284
What? You mean they're each other's first love

93
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,884
and are still in love with each other,

94
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:36,684
but Officer Chiba still isn't aware who she is?

95
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:38,584
Are you serious?

96
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:40,584
Yep!

97
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,184
Hold it.

98
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,484
Miwako and Officer Takagi...

99
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,784
Then, there are Officer Shiratori and Ms. Kobayashi, the teacher.

100
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:49,984
On top of that...

101
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:54,884
if those two get it on well...

102
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:58,784
Bye, Yumi.

103
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,184
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,784
See you.

105
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:06,884
I've got to stop them.

106
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:11,484
It's true that there are pictures taken from various angles.

107
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,584
But, including my car, I can't think of anything

108
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,184
that the cars that have been victimized have in common.

109
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:19,184
Don't tell me, she's asking about the mileage of my car?

110
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:21,784
I wonder what it was.

111
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:25,984
Don't you remember?

112
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:28,084
No, I don't remember.

113
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,284
I thought so.

114
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,884
Huh? I wonder if I voiced anything about the mileage?

115
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,284
Stupid.

116
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:41,784
So, let's hurry and go show the pictures to Conan!

117
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:45,184
He may come up with some interesting ideas again, you see!

118
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:48,484
She's obviously deliberately getting in the way.

119
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:51,384
It seems everything worked out the opposite of what was planned.

120
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,984
True.

121
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:59,784
Although the position of the wing is lower than that of Mr. Nawa's car...

122
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,684
I wonder why the car was attacked.

123
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:07,684
This is the second car that was vandalized, wasn't it?

124
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,684
Yes. It's the car of an officer worker

125
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,284
who was on his way home from golf.

126
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:14,984
There seems to be a lot of golf bags in the car.

127
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:18,384
It seems he had the golf bags of his friends inside too.

128
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:19,384
Wait a sec.

129
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:27,084
Could this be...

130
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:32,684
Hey, wasn't there any accidents near here

131
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:35,384
where a child was involved recently?

132
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:38,084
Yes, there was, last month.

133
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,184
The car that caused the accident

134
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,684
belonged to a high school teacher.

135
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,884
I heard that the driver completely admitted it to be his/her fault

136
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,284
and the case was settled out of court.

137
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,484
What kind of car was it?

138
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,484
An ordinary station wagon.

139
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:53,784
It seems that the family was on their way to the beach.

140
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,784
They seem to have had

141
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:59,784
a lot of floats, beach balls, rubber boats and etc. loaded in their car.

142
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,884
There's no mistake about it.

143
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,384
The culprit is the person trying to force open

144
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:09,484
the eyes of the person whose eyes are closed.

145
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,584
And, so, Conan?

146
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:19,484
Have you figured something out from looking at that picture?

147
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:21,684
Huh? About what?

148
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:24,584
So!

149
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,084
Anything about serial car thief that sprayed the word "Die"

150
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,684
on the windshield with red spray paint,

151
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,184
who tried to make it off on that car,

152
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:37,184
but couldn't because she crashed into the car in front!

153
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:41,184
Moreover, since we closed off this parking lot after that accident,

154
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:43,784
the people who were here back then was

155
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:47,184
Mr. Fukuchi who was in his car that is said to have been hit from behind,

156
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:49,384
Mrs. Shigei, the owner of the car that was vandalized,

157
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:53,384
as well as the very car that hit Mr. Fukuchi's car

158
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,784
and Mr. Nawa who claims that he was waiting for his friend to show up.

159
00:09:57,784 --> 00:10:02,184
So, Conan? Who of the three is the car thief?

160
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,084
Beats me.

161
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,584
I'm just a child, you know.

162
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:10,084
Don't tell me that you're not telling me despite knowing who it is.

163
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,084
Hey, Yumi...

164
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:14,784
The department store is asking

165
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:18,584
if they can start letting the customers into the parking lot already.

166
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,784
We've got no choice, let them in.

167
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,784
Okay, I guess we get to go too, don't we?

168
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:27,884
No! Because the culprit is among one of you three!

169
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,484
Then, why don't we do this?

170
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:33,484
Let's have the three come to the police station for now

171
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,084
and have them give their names, address,

172
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:39,084
as well as the reason why they're here and all the details to you, Yumi.

173
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:41,384
As for Officer Chiba's car

174
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,784
that was vandalized before the other cars were,

175
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:47,584
how about having the other policewoman take charge?

176
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,984
I guess so.

177
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,284
The young should work together.

178
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,684
Great idea, I guess.

179
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,084
I agree!

180
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,984
Yep, yep!

181
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,084
Well...

182
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,984
since I'm off duty, it doesn't bother me.

183
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,284
It... it really doesn't bother me either.

184
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:05,084
No way!

185
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,884
You belong to the second department

186
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,484
of violent crime investigations third division, don't you?

187
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,484
So you should be going after murderers!

188
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:12,584
But, you told me to cooperate with you just a while ago.

189
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,784
A while ago is a while ago, and now is now!

190
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,584
What?

191
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,584
She's getting in the way again.

192
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:19,684
Yep.

193
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:23,184
You go tell the department store to open up the parking lot.

194
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,284
Yes!

195
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,984
You go on home, Officer Chiba because you're just getting in the way!

196
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,684
Getting in the way?

197
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:31,484
Hey, do you have any acquaintances

198
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,484
that would print Ita cars, Officer Chiba?

199
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,984
I do.

200
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:38,484
How soon can it be printed?

201
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:41,484
Well, it's like a seal, so...

202
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,684
If it's just an ordinary character in stock

203
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:43,884
and only to be printed on one side,

204
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,984
I think it can be completed in two or three hours.

205
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:48,284
If so...

206
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,784
-What's this about? -Tell me about it too.

207
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:52,884
-Me too. -Tell me too!

208
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,684
Yes. It's okay to let the customers in,

209
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:58,484
but please inform them that they must avoid and go around

210
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,884
the scene of the accident.

211
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:04,184
I informed the department store.

212
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:07,684
Then, have the three come to the police station

213
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:10,584
and let's start interrogating them separately.

214
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,484
I think two or three hours...

215
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,984
That will do.

216
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,061
Hey, Takagi.

217
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,461
Have you seen my car key?

218
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,561
Oh, that...

219
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,161
Yumi took it with her a while ago.

220
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,761
Yumi did?

221
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,761
She said, "We'll do a little decorating, give me a sec".

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,361
Decorating?

223
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,661
Don't tell me, not again...

224
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,861
She's planning to stick on those weird stickers!

225
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,061
Stickers?

226
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,161
The ones that look like the green beginner driver stickers.

227
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:55,461
The ones that say, "Beginner lover's driving"!

228
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:58,961
I didn't realize that the sticker was on my car last time

229
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,761
and went to a murder site with it on

230
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,561
and was embarrassed to no end, you see!

231
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:07,961
Well, if they're magnet type or suction type stickers,

232
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,861
like the beginner driver stickers,

233
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,861
they can be removed easily.

234
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,261
Yes. That's it!

235
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:11,761
No more, because if you continue,

236
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:14,061
Miwako will get angry.

237
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,061
We've finally figured out

238
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:20,061
what the cars that were attacked had in common.

239
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,861
The first car was an Ita car.

240
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,661
The second car was loaded with golf bags.

241
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,861
The third car had wings.

242
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:32,461
The fourth one had toy boxes lined out.

243
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:36,361
And the Ita character that was decorated on the FD car.

244
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:40,661
The cars that were attacked

245
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:44,361
all had their rear windows blocked with something!

246
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:48,361
That's why you didn't attack Mr. Nawa's hot rod, right?

247
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,861
A flashy wing was attached,

248
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,761
but the position of the wing was low

249
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,761
and the rear window wasn't blocked off.

250
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,561
So on the other hand, stuffed dolls were lined out

251
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:01,261
blocking the entire rear window of Mr. Fukuchi's car.

252
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:04,461
Just when the car was about to start off,

253
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,361
you saw this from the driver's seat of your car

254
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:10,561
and inadvertently crashed your car into someone else's car.

255
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,461
That's right, isn't it?

256
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,861
Mrs. Noriko Shigiei!

257
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,561
After the collision,

258
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,361
you snapped back to yourself

259
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,661
and in order to make it through back then...

260
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:27,261
you used the spray that you had in your car

261
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,661
to write the word "Die"

262
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,961
to make it look as if the car thief had done it!

263
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:33,361
You figured that nobody would mentally suspect

264
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,361
that a car thief would vandalize his own car,

265
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,761
and you took advantage of this.

266
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,961
Is there something wrong in what I'm saying?

267
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,261
No use trying to flee!

268
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:59,861
This entire area has been completely surrounded by the police

269
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:01,761
while you were going through interrogation.

270
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,261
Yes.

271
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,061
This place is near your house

272
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,061
and on the way to the station.

273
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,061
In other words,

274
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,961
we were staking you out thinking that you, after seeing this Ita car

275
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:14,861
would return home to get the spray and tools necessary

276
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,761
to force open the key and return to the site.

277
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:21,361
Well, since tonight's strategy of using the FD was a trap set by us,

278
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:23,961
we'll overlook this, but...

279
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,161
as for the other things, spit it out, will you?

280
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,561
You did all this

281
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:31,561
for your son who died of a traffic accident last month, right?

282
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,261
The cause of the accident was careless safety confirmation.

283
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,561
Because the car was full of floats and rubber boats,

284
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:44,061
the view from the rearview mirror was blocked.

285
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,261
And, since you,

286
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:48,361
who unfortunately was behind that car pushing a stroller along,

287
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:51,561
wasn't in view of the driver,

288
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:55,761
you decided to attack all the impudent cars

289
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,561
with blocked rear view vision

290
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:01,761
to give them a taste of their own medicine.

291
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,661
But what a sad case

292
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,261
that the victim of an unfair accidental crime,

293
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:21,961
commits a crime in turn and becomes the criminal.

294
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,661
Yes.

295
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:26,361
The regulation concerning rear windows is ambiguous

296
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,861
and there are no laws to really enforce them yet.

297
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:31,261
But, Conan,

298
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,661
it's amazing

299
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,561
how you figured out that Mrs. Shigei lost her child.

300
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:39,561
It's the discolored part in the backseat of Mrs. Shigei's car.

301
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:43,561
I realized it when I saw the car in the parking lot.

302
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:47,061
It's discolored because a child seat was there, right?

303
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:48,861
If the car was newly bought only last year

304
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,761
and that seat is already discolored,

305
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:53,461
it means that she had a child till last year, right?

306
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:57,661
But, it may have been removed because the child already grew up.

307
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,061
If the child needs a child seat,

308
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:02,561
he has to be younger than us.

309
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,961
So, if she were held back for interrogation as long as she was,

310
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,861
she would've naturally gotten worried about her child, right?

311
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:11,861
Come to think of it, that person...

312
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:16,561
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

313
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:20,261
She was only worried about her husband's dinner.

314
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:24,461
Right, right! The man said that his daughter was waiting, though.

315
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:29,261
I see! That's why she got a little angry when I asked

316
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:30,761
if there were any toys or things in the car.

317
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,461
Yep, because she had no need for things like that.

318
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,861
But, how'd you know

319
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,761
that the man had many dolls lined out in the back of his car?

320
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,061
Right,

321
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,161
although we could see that a lot was on the backseat of the car...

322
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,461
That man was saying, right?

323
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,261
That his daughter usually lines them out nicely so the view is not blocked.

324
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,261
In order to do so,

325
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,561
she has no choice but to line them out

326
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:58,361
on the rear window of the backseat, which is behind her head.

327
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,961
I see,

328
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:04,161
that's why she impulsively hit her own car.

329
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:05,161
She couldn't have possibly

330
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,561
gone into someone else's car while someone was inside it

331
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,661
and write the word "Die".

332
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,361
Right.

333
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,361
She may have wanted to expand the driver's view,

334
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,361
if she couldn't warn him by words.

335
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,461
The stuffed dolls would fall with the impact of the collision too.

336
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,361
But, unlike the other cars,

337
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,361
why was only the windshield of that car sprayed with red paint?

338
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:30,661
All the other cars had the word written on the ceiling inside, right?

339
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,261
Lipstick!

340
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:35,261
Her face was buried in the airbag that was ejected by the impact

341
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,561
and her lipstick got on it,

342
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:41,161
so she probably hid it with the same color red spray.

343
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,661
I think she tried to make it look as if

344
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:46,261
the red spray paint word on the windshield got onto the airbag.

345
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,361
Well, if lipstick is on it,

346
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,661
then saliva should also be there,

347
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,161
so we could've come up with the culprit by a DNA test.

348
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,761
Then, it wouldn't have been necessary to set a trap.

349
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:00,061
No, we did the right thing.

350
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:02,061
We couldn't let her go any further.

351
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:06,061
We don't want her to commit anymore sad crimes like this.

352
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:11,761
Then, Yumi!

353
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,261
I'll be leaving.

354
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:15,861
I may do some interrogation later,

355
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:18,261
so see you then!

356
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:22,261
I guess I'll inform Miwako who I borrowed the car from then.

357
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:28,161
See you, Officer Chiba!

358
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,161
Yeah!

359
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:41,261
That's right, I...

360
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:44,961
I've got to go back to the station on Miwako's FD,

361
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,561
so will you take care of our mini police car for me?

362
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,961
Yes!

363
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,861
Well, since you're at it,

364
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,561
why not give Officer Chiba a ride home?

365
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:54,761
Yes!

366
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,361
I feel like I'm being escorted off or something.

367
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,861
I feel nervous.

368
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,261
This is the first time I ever rode a mini police car, you see.

369
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:06,861
Is that right?

370
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,161
But...

371
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:13,961
I can't help feeling that this isn't the first time.

372
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:15,561
That I'm seeing you.

373
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,861
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...

374
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:25,061
could you by chance be...

375
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,961
Yes?

376
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,361
Could you by chance be...

377
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:56,161
Yes.

378
00:22:56,161 --> 00:23:00,361
The officer that gave me a parking ticket at Haido-cho the other day?

379
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,261
Yes.

380
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:05,361
I was transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department last month.

381
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:06,861
Just as I thought!

382
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:09,261
I was sure that I met you somewhere!

383
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,561
I see!

384
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:16,061
It seems as if Officer Chiba is not aware of anything.

385
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,361
-What? -What?

386
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,161
No kidding?

387
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:22,361
After Yumi tried to give them a chance...

388
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,461
Really.

389
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:25,961
It was like throwing pearls before swine after all.

390
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,561
Hey, hey.

391
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:29,861
Maybe it's better to say it's like preaching to deaf ears.

392
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,561
It can't be.

393
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,861
Hey!

394
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:57,461
What is this?

395
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:59,661
Please don't get mad at me.

396
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,600
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,340
"Key".

398
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,300
In the next episode, Pops will play the good man.

399
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,880
-No darn way. -True.

400
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,160
I guess so.
