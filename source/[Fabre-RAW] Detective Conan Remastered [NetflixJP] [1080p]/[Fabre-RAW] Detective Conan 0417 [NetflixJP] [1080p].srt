1
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:03,354
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,354 --> 00:00:05,454
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:07,354
Today's story is the climax of the Butsumetsu mystery.

4
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:08,654
Ran's casual remark helps clear-up the mystery!

5
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,754
It rings a bell to something that was almost overlooked!

6
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:12,354
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,254
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,554
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:01,524
We were invited to a wealthy person's residence in Shizuoka prefecture.

10
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,924
At that residence,

11
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,124
for the past few years,

12
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,824
on the 4th of Butsumetsu, a phenomenon was always said to occur.

13
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,824
And on October 4th,

14
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:14,324
there were two victims in the house.

15
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:17,724
What? Fingerprints were detected from the rope and medicine bottle?

16
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:22,424
And? Whose fingerprints did it match?

17
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:25,324
Well...

18
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:28,824
It doesn't match anyone who works in this house.

19
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:31,724
It's an unknown fingerprint.

20
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:39,124
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Solution)"

21
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:42,124
Then we know it's an outsider who did it.

22
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:45,624
Can we go back to our rooms and rest?

23
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:50,424
Yes. A policeman will be right outside each of your rooms,

24
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:51,824
but please get some rest.

25
00:02:56,124 --> 00:02:59,924
Hey, where does Mr. Sekiguchi live and what does he do?

26
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,324
His company is...

27
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,624
Mr. Watabiki?

28
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,624
Yes.

29
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:09,624
It's Sekiguchi Securities at Umeki City, Nishi-ku, Yokohama.

30
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,124
Detailed, aren't you?

31
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,624
I go to pick Mr. Sekiguchi up whenever he comes here.

32
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:17,424
He's memo crazy.

33
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:18,524
Memo crazy?

34
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:20,924
By the way, wasn't it in Yokohama that...

35
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:24,024
Yes, my brother.

36
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:27,024
What is it, brother? At this time of night!

37
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,724
Toshimichi Sekiguchi? Yes, I know him.

38
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,124
I met him a few times when he was still a newcomer.

39
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:35,424
I remember him well because I didn't like him.

40
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,924
So what's with him?

41
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:41,624
He was found hanging from a rope at Kunitomo's residence.

42
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:44,224
What? He committed suicide?

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,224
He might have been murdered.

44
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:51,224
After that, it seems like someone also killed the owner of the residence.

45
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:56,724
Well, I met the guy when the company president's family

46
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:59,224
filed a missing person report.

47
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:00,924
Missing person report?

48
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:04,624
Yes. The president suddenly disappeared!

49
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:07,924
He still hasn't returned after 13 years.

50
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:10,024
13 years?

51
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:15,224
It was the end of September 13 years ago.

52
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:18,024
It was on mother's birthday.

53
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,424
Which means that 13 years ago on September 26th,

54
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,724
the president disappeared?

55
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:27,124
If I'm not mistaken, the ship sunk at Suruga Bay

56
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:29,724
13 years ago on September 29th.

57
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,124
3 days before...

58
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:34,824
And that Sekiguchi stepped in to take his place.

59
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,124
Inspector!

60
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,524
Let's go for a few drinks after work.

61
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,524
Okay, but let's split the bill!

62
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:42,024
Hey, why don't you treat him once in a while?

63
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:44,224
You're so stingy.

64
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:47,624
Call me an economical person! See you!

65
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:53,324
Stingy people living here must also have some peculiar habits or symptoms.

66
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:56,924
You all look tired so why don't all of you get some rest, Mr. Mouri?

67
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,124
Yes, I think we'll do that.

68
00:04:58,124 --> 00:04:59,624
Hey, before you go to sleep,

69
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:02,524
let's check up on the people in their bedrooms.

70
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,724
Let's check if the habits and symptoms they were talking about

71
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,124
are real or not!

72
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:12,024
You want to know why I have belonephobia?

73
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:15,024
When I was a child, I took my mother's sewing box,

74
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:18,524
it fell and a needle poked onto my forehead.

75
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:20,624
That must have hurt.

76
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:21,724
Huh?

77
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,224
Is that why the calendar is stuck on the wall with tape?

78
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,424
Yes.

79
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,524
There are some marks on the calendar.

80
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:36,124
It's the birthdays of myself, my daughter, Mr. Akatsuka and Mr. Watabiki.

81
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:40,524
My husband, Mr. Watabiki's father, and Mr. Akatsugi's wife

82
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:44,024
who died in the ship accident were all classmates from grade school

83
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:48,024
and we always celebrated our birthdays together.

84
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:53,724
Before Mr. Watabiki's mother passed away, there were eight marks.

85
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:55,124
It has become half of that now.

86
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,124
If you want to know about my fear for heights,

87
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:04,224
you'd better ask Mr. Akatsuka and Mr. Watabiki.

88
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,924
You fell from a high place because of them?

89
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,324
It's the opposite!

90
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,224
When I was in 4th grade,

91
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:14,924
when I fell from a tree, Watabiki saved me from the fall.

92
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,724
And that time, the left hand...

93
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,624
Then you must have been hurt real bad?

94
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,024
No.

95
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:22,324
Actually, it was Watabiki who got hurt.

96
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:23,424
A year or two ago,

97
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,424
I had completely forgotten until I saw the scar on his hand.

98
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:30,524
He's obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves.

99
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:38,224
I always thought it was his younger brother that saved me.

100
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:41,224
The room is so clean.

101
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:44,624
Of course! Chefs are supposed to be clean.

102
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:45,624
I guess that's right.

103
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:48,724
Hey! Don't come into girl's room without permission!

104
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:49,724
Excuse me!

105
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,324
This is the scar from back then.

106
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:55,424
So what's the problem?

107
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:58,724
You wear gloves inside your room, too.

108
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:03,624
Yes. Except during bath time and when I had my fingerprints taken.

109
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:07,624
And I also take them off when I drive and write.

110
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:11,824
These are the gloves your younger brother used.

111
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:15,824
But my brother used them when he was a kid.

112
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:18,424
I don't see the older brother's gloves.

113
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:21,624
Unlike my younger brother, I am not a sportsman.

114
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,124
Really?

115
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,424
Huh?

116
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:28,324
Your calendar also has a lot of marks.

117
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,524
Yes.

118
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:33,324
I once forgot my master's business.

119
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:36,524
Ever since then, I write things down.

120
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:41,124
What? How did I became a perfectionist?

121
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:43,524
Do I need to have a reason?

122
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,924
You're absolutely right.

123
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:48,224
It seems like your tidiness is for real.

124
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:51,324
Everything in this room is straight and tidy.

125
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:54,024
I can't settle down until I do so.

126
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,924
Hey, is there someone who is just the opposite?

127
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:59,024
Not really sloppy, but...

128
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:01,424
Shigeko seems to be a little sloppy.

129
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:06,524
The way she piles the plates up is always three millimetres off.

130
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:10,924
Watabiki and Namika are always precise.

131
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,324
What's this?

132
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,524
Is this compass yours?

133
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:16,724
Yes, I like to hike to the mountains.

134
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:21,224
Hey, did you notice the letters engraved in Mr. Sekiguchi's watch?

135
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,324
What?

136
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:25,224
Right, wasn't it "E" and "N"?

137
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:28,124
But isn't it weird? If it's the same as this compass,

138
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,424
the position of the "N" and "E" was wrong, wasn't it?

139
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,824
I wonder why?

140
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,524
I don't know!

141
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:37,624
Well, we went around the four rooms.

142
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,424
We didn't find anything suspicious, did we?

143
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:43,824
This kid just took us for a ride!

144
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,524
Well, let's continue with the investigation after a little rest.

145
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,924
Yes, let's do that.

146
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:53,224
I wonder what it is. Something's not right.

147
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,424
I feel like I must've overlooked something.

148
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:58,424
It doesn't feel right. What is it?

149
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:00,024
Hey, Conan.

150
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:03,024
I bought you new pyjamas, do you want to wear it tonight?

151
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,024
It's a matching outfit with mine.

152
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:06,724
Huh?

153
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:07,824
Matching outfit?

154
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:13,624
I see. I must have overlooked this possibility.

155
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:18,424
If that is the truth, the factitive method of Sekiguchi's murder,

156
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,524
the method used to go through the fingerprint identification machine,

157
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,824
the mystery of the killer's disappearance from the third floor,

158
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,624
the reason why the master was surprised enough to have a fit,

159
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:28,924
this will explain it all!

160
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,424
-Well done. -Hey!

161
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:34,624
Mr. Kogoro asked to have the four people and the wife

162
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,524
to assemble on the third floor.

163
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:40,024
What? Does Mr. Mouri know who the culprit is?

164
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:41,924
Yes, I think so.

165
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:43,424
He said the culprit is still here,

166
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,524
so please don't let him escape.

167
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:48,924
That's great! He's going to start the deduction show!

168
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:52,024
Not right now, but in about three hours later.

169
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,824
What? Three hours later?

170
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:55,124
Yes, of course.

171
00:09:55,124 --> 00:10:00,224
Only if Inspector Yokomizo listens and does what he says.

172
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:03,824
Yes, certainly.

173
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:12,768
What is it? It's so early in the morning.

174
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:18,168
Let me explain the truth of the two murders that took place here.

175
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:22,768
And that the culprit is among you.

176
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:26,668
First of all, the murder of Mr. Sekiguchi which is the first case.

177
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,868
But didn't you say that it was an outsiders doing?

178
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:31,868
Yes, that's right.

179
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:32,868
That's true.

180
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:37,468
Namika who is afraid of heights couldn't have hung anybody

181
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:39,168
on the third floor's veranda.

182
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:41,568
Shigeko who has belonephobia

183
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:44,468
would have avoided places where sharp points such as the iron fencing.

184
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,668
The words that were written on the card

185
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:49,068
that the culprit is thought to have slipped into Sekiguchi's pocket.

186
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,868
The lettering was slanted.

187
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:55,168
A tidy and perfectionist Akatsuka would not have done that.

188
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:59,168
At the time of the crime, Watabiki and the master's wife

189
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,768
who went to the hospital with the master,

190
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:02,668
could not have committed the crime.

191
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:03,968
Then who did it?

192
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:09,268
You're not really saying that someone among us is faking it, are you?

193
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,268
No. Namika's room is clean,

194
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:15,868
but the area around the window was not.

195
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,568
This proves that you are afraid of heights

196
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,868
because you cannot come close to the window.

197
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:24,468
Shigeko who has belonephobia uses tape to hang her calendar.

198
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,668
Even when we intruded Akatsuka's room unexpectedly,

199
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:30,168
the things in the room were tidy.

200
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:33,668
I think it is safe to say that no one is lying.

201
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:37,368
Let's investigate the second crime.

202
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,368
A person enters this bedroom on the third floor

203
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,968
by opening the door of the fingerprint identification machine

204
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:42,968
and slips through.

205
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,268
This person sets things up to cause the master to have a heart attack

206
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:46,568
that results in death

207
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:50,468
and disappears without leaving any traces of having run away.

208
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,368
The plausible explanation here

209
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:54,868
is the getaway rope tied to the veranda.

210
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,168
The culprit notices Conan climbing up the rope,

211
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:59,768
so the culprit withdrew from the room

212
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:02,268
and hide behind the fingerprint identification machine door.

213
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:05,368
And managed to blend in with us without anyone noticing it.

214
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:07,068
This is possible.

215
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,968
But wasn't that proven innocent

216
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:13,568
by the fingerprints on the medicine bottle and rope?

217
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,268
That is probably the fingerprints of the accomplice.

218
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,668
-Accomplice? -Accomplice?

219
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:21,668
Yes, there are two culprits!

220
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:27,468
Does that mean that someone amongst us brought someone suspicious with us?

221
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:33,168
But the master said that he wasn't planning on meeting anyone today.

222
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,468
After all,

223
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:38,868
we all looked in every room on the third floor and we didn't find anyone!

224
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:42,668
Well, no one suspicious turned up

225
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:46,668
and there was no trace of escape from the veranda nor the window.

226
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,668
Then where's the accomplice?

227
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,068
Yes, so...

228
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,868
I wanted to re-enact this with everyone

229
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:54,968
and that is why I asked you all to come here.

230
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:58,368
I might have overlooked something.

231
00:12:58,368 --> 00:12:59,868
Okay, everyone!

232
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:02,368
We are going to search the rooms one by one.

233
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:06,568
Unlike then, I will enter the room last

234
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:11,068
in order to watch if anyone makes a suspicious move.

235
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:16,868
So would Watabiki play my role by entering first

236
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:19,068
and inspecting the window and veranda?

237
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:21,368
-Okay? -Sure!

238
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:26,068
So let's start with the library next to the bedroom.

239
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:29,768
And of course, if you see something or notice something,

240
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,368
please let me know!

241
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:36,068
You don't have to shout. I can hear you clearly.

242
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:39,468
I'm sorry. I shout whenever I get excited.

243
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,268
Mr. Watabiki, please go in.

244
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,968
Yes.

245
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:47,968
The window is locked.

246
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,468
No one's on the veranda.

247
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:52,568
May we also go in?

248
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:54,068
Yes, of course!

249
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:57,168
Do you think we'll find something out this way?

250
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,068
Yes.

251
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:00,968
Then, let's go to the next room.

252
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:02,668
Everyone, please hurry.

253
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,968
No one suspicious came to the hallway.

254
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,468
Thank you, Conan!

255
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,268
Darn it.

256
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:11,368
Nothing turned up!

257
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:16,168
So if we're done, I'd like to get back to work!

258
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,468
Stop babbling and answer my questions.

259
00:14:19,468 --> 00:14:22,768
Are you really sure there was no one suspicious?

260
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:24,868
Was someone there or not? Which is it?

261
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,068
No one was there...

262
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:32,868
No, there was someone there in the room that you just searched.

263
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:36,068
I just told you that no one was there!

264
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:40,068
Yes, there is. There's one more person behind Inspector Yokomizo.

265
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,168
Twins...

266
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:49,668
Yes. He's my brother who works for the Kanagawa Prefectural Police.

267
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,968
Hi.

268
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,868
I'll be off then.

269
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:56,368
Don't tell my boss that I was in on this investigation.

270
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:58,068
Right. Thanks.

271
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:00,768
But why is twin the answer?

272
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,068
In other words, it's like this...

273
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,268
When we were searching the room, the culprit stayed in the back,

274
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:10,768
making sure to do so when entering and leaving the room.

275
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,568
He acted as though he was leaving the room

276
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,568
right before the one the accomplice was in,

277
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,768
but he stayed there in the room right before the accomplice was hiding.

278
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:19,168
When Inspector Yokomizo finished searching the window

279
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,168
and you guys were waiting in order to enter the room,

280
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:26,868
the accomplice that was hiding behind the door joined everyone.

281
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:30,268
If the accomplice is a twin wearing the same clothes,

282
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:32,968
switching places like Inspector Yokomizo did

283
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:34,368
no one would have noticed

284
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:38,368
nor would have been suspicious that somebody else was hiding.

285
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,468
But...

286
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:40,568
Where are they?

287
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,668
There are no twins here!

288
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:47,468
Right. When Shigeko mentioned the story about everyone's birthdays,

289
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,968
something bothered me.

290
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:52,768
20 years ago, there were Watabiki, his parents and his younger brother,

291
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:56,368
Shigeko and her husband and Namika as well as Akatsuka and his wife.

292
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:58,768
There were supposed to be a total of nine birthdays,

293
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,668
but she said there were only eight.

294
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,868
Which means someone had the same birthday.

295
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:08,268
After hearing Namika fell off a tree when she was in fourth grade,

296
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,968
I was convinced.

297
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:14,768
She could just vaguely remember who saved her at that age

298
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:18,768
is because there were two people that were alike.

299
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:19,768
In other words,

300
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:25,668
Watabiki, you conspired with your twin brother and committed this crime.

301
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:26,968
What are you talking about?

302
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:30,568
His brother died in that accident 13 years ago!

303
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:32,968
What if he didn't die in that accident?

304
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:34,068
What?

305
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:38,268
What if he swam to shore and survived?

306
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:41,868
To prove that, there is a scar on the palm of his left hand,

307
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,768
which he got when he saved Namika from her fall.

308
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:47,668
When he drove us here,

309
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:52,468
there was no scar on his left hand.

310
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:56,368
The mark at the head of the words on the calendar in his room

311
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:58,668
were different depending on the date.

312
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:02,368
They probably switched places once in a while,

313
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:08,868
noting everything down and by using the same organizer,

314
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:11,568
they could become one and the same person.

315
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:12,968
They did it in preparation for today.

316
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:16,368
In order to murder Mr. Sekiguchi and the master!

317
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,968
The younger brother took the two of them to the hospital

318
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,368
to establish an alibi.

319
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:24,068
After that, the older brother who was hiding in the mansion

320
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:27,168
enters the third floor by making Sekiguchi open the door.

321
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:32,268
He choked Sekiguchi and hung him from the veranda railing.

322
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:36,268
And after a few hours, he goes to the third floor again

323
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,168
and murdered the master.

324
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:42,868
But master said he wasn't going to meet anyone.

325
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,668
The master will meet him

326
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:49,268
especially if he was with the master when Sekiguchi was killed.

327
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,868
Since he would be the most unsuspicious person.

328
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:55,868
The master must have been surprised.

329
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:59,068
A man wearing the same clothes with the same face appears.

330
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,968
Furthermore, that is the same person who supposedly

331
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:04,168
was said to have died 13 years ago.

332
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,368
You deliberately left your younger brother's fingerprints

333
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,668
on the medicine bottle and rope

334
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:11,768
to make us believe it was of an unknown person is the culprit.

335
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:13,568
This is to exclude the people inside the premise

336
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,268
from the suspect list.

337
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,568
But where is the other one?

338
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:20,868
He didn't turn up in the search, right?

339
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:25,168
That is why I asked Mr. Watabiki to search the window

340
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:28,668
and gave you instructions in a loud voice.

341
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:33,068
So that the accomplice who is hiding on the third floor can hear.

342
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,668
I dropped him hints telling him that he'll be safe on the veranda!

343
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:41,168
The police has surrounded the premise!

344
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,368
Please bring him in.

345
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:45,568
That won't be necessary.

346
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:47,268
Brother.

347
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:50,168
-Then you will admit to the crimes? -Yes.

348
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,368
Wait a minute! If you're alive...

349
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:54,668
What about my father?

350
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:55,668
What about my wife?

351
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,968
They probably died

352
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,968
because they were abandoned by you-know-who.

353
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:02,768
What is it?

354
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:06,268
What happened 13 years ago?

355
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:10,268
Something suddenly went wrong with the ship while cruising,

356
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:12,968
so I dived to check it out.

357
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:17,468
Someone's bag was tangled in the screw and helm.

358
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,268
And inside it was somebody's hand.

359
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:20,868
A human hand?

360
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,368
It was most probably the hand of the missing former president

361
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:26,868
of Sekiguchi's company who disappeared 13 years ago.

362
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:31,668
He suddenly participated in the cruise to dump the body into the sea.

363
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:36,168
In other words, the fifth soul written on the first card

364
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:39,068
was referred to him.

365
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:42,068
Did you know that he was going to dump the dead body?

366
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,268
No, I didn't know!

367
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,968
When I told everyone on the ship,

368
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:52,368
Sekiguchi suddenly shoved father away and speed the ship up.

369
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,868
Speeding without having control of the helm,

370
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:58,568
the ship turned over and everyone was tossed into the sea.

371
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:01,768
Only the master and his wife escaped

372
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,768
with the only rubber raft that had air in it.

373
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:08,268
No! I was going to return to call for help.

374
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,968
But Sekiguchi...

375
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:12,068
They won't survive anyway!

376
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:13,768
Just keep quiet about this,

377
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:16,668
both of you are also an accomplice and abandoned them!

378
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,468
That's what he told me.

379
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,568
We were all holding on to a small float,

380
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,568
but thought that we would all die like this.

381
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,468
So the person with the most physical strength, me,

382
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,468
went to call for help.

383
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,768
But I felt consciousness slipping away.

384
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:34,568
When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed

385
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,868
and I lost my memory.

386
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,368
I sneaked out of the hospital and wandered around.

387
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,968
Then in summer two years ago,

388
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:42,768
I coincidently met my brother

389
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:45,668
and at the same time, my memory came back to me.

390
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,768
I met my brother on the day

391
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:52,568
after I almost had a car accident with the master's car.

392
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:54,468
The accident was my fault,

393
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,268
but master was the one who kept on apologizing,

394
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,968
so I thought it a little weird.

395
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:04,768
That night, when I heard my brother's tale, I understood why.

396
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:07,768
Then the master's nightmare and the car accident

397
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,868
on the 4th of Butsumetsu was a coincidence?

398
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,968
Yes.

399
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:14,768
That's where we got the idea of taking revenge.

400
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:18,968
There was no evidence left for the police anyway.

401
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:21,268
But if we can find the sunken ship...

402
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,368
That's impossible!

403
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,568
It actually sank within the Suruga Bay,

404
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:28,068
but he told the police it sank way out at sea.

405
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,468
34 degrees north latitude 45 minutes,

406
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:32,568
138 degrees east longitude 30 minutes.

407
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:38,168
Don't you guys remember? The "N" and "E" engraved on Mr. Sekiguchi's watch.

408
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:40,368
"N" is north latitude 45 minutes,

409
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,668
"E" is east longitude 30 minutes!

410
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,668
If it's within Suruga Bay,

411
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,668
then it's approximately 34 degrees north latitude

412
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,468
and 138 degrees east longitude.

413
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:51,368
That's probably where the ship sank.

414
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:53,468
So that's what it means.

415
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:55,868
But why on the 4th, the unlucky day?

416
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:59,668
The ship accident was on September 29, a lucky day.

417
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:03,168
That's because 13 years ago this day,

418
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,368
October 4th was Butsumetsu.

419
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,268
It was when the master went to the police

420
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:09,768
to ask them to stop the investigation.

421
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:38,868
After that, although the tide drifted it a little,

422
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:41,368
the ship was somehow found

423
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:45,068
with the bag in question still tangled in the screw.

424
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,368
Talking about a problem,

425
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:49,368
ever since that day, there's a problem that's been on my mind.

426
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:51,068
Hey, Conan!

427
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,568
Let's at least wear it once and take a picture!

428
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:56,468
It's cute!

429
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,168
A junior in high school wearing stuffed animal pyjamas.

430
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,268
What's more, it's a panda.

431
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:34,036
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:36,236
"Nameplate"

433
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:37,836
In the next episode, those two who we haven't seen in a while...

434
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:41,036
-Those two? -The surprise is for next week!
