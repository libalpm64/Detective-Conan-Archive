1
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,414
It's still early in the year and yet I caught a cold.

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:08,114
Geez, talk about bad luck.

3
00:00:08,114 --> 00:00:12,414
We had made plans to play karuta cards at Ayumi's place,

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:14,214
when a boy named Masao,

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,014
who's living on the same floor in Room 2806,

6
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:22,914
and his parents interrupted us.

7
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,714
After seeing these three via the video call,

8
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:28,614
I saw through the fact that they weren't his real parents.

9
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:30,814
And urged Mitsuhiko and the others

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,214
to contact the police before ending the call.

11
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,914
Although Conan said so,

12
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,414
is that really the case?

13
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,014
In order to confirm it,

14
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:43,114
we had no choice but to barge into that family.

15
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:47,314
Our excuse was to play karuta cards with Masao.

16
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,614
However, even though he bragged about being good at grabbing karuta cards,

17
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:53,214
he couldn't grab any.

18
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:55,414
He finally grabbed his first card marked with "ni",

19
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:57,814
but got into a tug of war with Genta,

20
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,614
and insisted that "a hated child thrives better in the world"

21
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:02,514
was his card. How bizarre if that?

22
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:03,714
Wrong.

23
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:05,914
He was trying to use the karuta cards

24
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:08,414
to tell us something.

25
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:11,614
What might that be?

26
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:34,114
If all cases were men,

27
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:36,014
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

28
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,514
A message in the nick of time.

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,514
The truth that the karuta cards relay.

30
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:41,114
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:42,914
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:45,114
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:15,061
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 2)"

34
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:21,061
Now, on to the next one.

35
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:22,761
Different as chalk and cheese.

36
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,461
To hide your head but not your rear.

37
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,261
There.

38
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,361
-Ogre with an iron club. -Got it.

39
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:33,461
Next one...

40
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,361
Heaven knows and earth knows.

41
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,061
A lie which happened to come true.

42
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,161
This is it.

43
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:47,361
Only five cards left.

44
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,261
Let's move on.

45
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,861
Better dumplings than cherry blossoms.

46
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,961
Got it.

47
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,561
My seventh card.

48
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:58,661
There are only four cards left,

49
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:01,061
and since you only have four cards.

50
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,861
It means you can't beat me.

51
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,861
No, if Masao manages to take all four of the remaining cards,

52
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,461
he'd turn the tables and win.

53
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,261
Mommy, restroom.

54
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:18,261
The game is about to end, so just hold it.

55
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:21,761
Restroom. Can't hold it.

56
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,761
It can't be helped.

57
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:29,361
Fine, I'll go with you, okay?

58
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:33,761
Masao, you can't go to the restroom on your own?

59
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,761
Yes, my child has claustrophobia,

60
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,261
so he needs me by his side.

61
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,661
Say...

62
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,161
Take out that towel.

63
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,161
What?

64
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,461
The towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa.

65
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,661
I can't do without it.

66
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:53,361
Geez, stop saying selfish things.

67
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,761
Well, let's get going.

68
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,561
What do you think about that mother and child?

69
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,561
I think they're really related.

70
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,661
Because he said "Mommy, restroom" like a spoiled child.

71
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:12,061
You wouldn't call a bad person "Mommy", after all.

72
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,761
It could also be that he was forced to call her that.

73
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:18,561
I do think it's unusual

74
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,561
for that mother stick around Masao non-stop.

75
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:23,961
Yes, as if she's monitoring his every move

76
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:26,161
so that he can't try anything funny.

77
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,761
So, were they indeed...

78
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,961
The key to support or reject that theory is what Masao had...

79
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,361
The "ru", "ko", "ni", "te"...

80
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:36,961
These four cards might be our key.

81
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,661
But what on earth does its mean?

82
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:43,861
Maybe we should rearrange these to form a word.

83
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,761
I don't think we should.

84
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,461
The first card he took was "ni",

85
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,461
but he deliberately placed it so that it's the third card from the top.

86
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:54,161
Then, you mean this is the correct order?

87
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,561
Yeah, I think.

88
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:56,861
His attempt to go to the restroom,

89
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,461
as well as to evacuate the mother from here,

90
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:01,161
could've been an attempt to buy us time

91
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:05,161
in order to solve this code.

92
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,261
But I don't understand its meaning.

93
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:11,261
If we read it backwards, won't work either.

94
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:15,061
And to begin with, even if the mother and father are fake,

95
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:16,261
I can't figure out the reason

96
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:19,061
why they'd be staying here acting as his parents.

97
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:20,161
If they're kidnappers,

98
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,661
they should've already moved to another place.

99
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,861
If they're robbers,

100
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:28,761
they would've pretended no one's home and not let us in.

101
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,461
In that case,

102
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,861
let's call Conan and ask him about this.

103
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,561
If we do that, wouldn't we be able to know the truth?

104
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,961
But, Conan...

105
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,161
I bet he's asleep because of his cold.

106
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:42,061
However, if that mother is really a fake,

107
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,461
wouldn't it be dangerous?

108
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,361
We have no choice.

109
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,561
In that case, let's text him.

110
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:50,861
If he still has the strength to get up

111
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,461
and read my text he'll reply soon.

112
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,961
And if he doesn't, it means he's still asleep.

113
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:57,961
What are you going to write in your email?

114
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:01,161
The sequence of events leading to our visit to Masao's place.

115
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,861
I don't know why, but...

116
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,661
Edogawa suspected that those three people weren't biologically related,

117
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,761
just by watching the video call.

118
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:12,661
And he told us to call the police.

119
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:19,661
But we had doubts about that deduction,

120
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,761
so we asked the neighbors of Masao.

121
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:24,661
The lady in Room 2807 said

122
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,461
Masao's family just moved in

123
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:30,861
and that she hasn't met his parents, right?

124
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:34,661
She did say that she knew the previous resident of this room.

125
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:37,961
Yes, formerly employed by the Isobe Corporation,

126
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,861
which is now under suspicion of tax evasion.

127
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,961
And the name was Mr. Uemura.

128
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,761
The man from Room 2805 also said

129
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:49,261
he'd never seen Masao's parents.

130
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,261
Come to think of it,

131
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,761
he also said that he saw Producer Hida from Nichiuri TV

132
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,661
about two weeks ago.

133
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,361
He saw the producer going into Room 2806.

134
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:02,761
But, that producer later had a traffic accident

135
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,861
and was in critical condition until yesterday.

136
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,561
The matching statements of the two neighbors were...

137
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,961
that Masao is a prankster

138
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,261
and a big liar on top of that.

139
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,261
As such, we came to Masao's place to ascertain the truth,

140
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:22,561
using playing karuta cards as an excuse to get inside.

141
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:28,561
Then Masao left us the four cards he took "ru, ko, ni, te",

142
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,661
while going to the restroom with the mother,

143
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,761
and here we are now.

144
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,761
Shouldn't we write about the towel as well?

145
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:36,861
If I recall,

146
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,861
he said, "I can't go to the restroom

147
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:41,561
without the towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa on it".

148
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,861
That's right.

149
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,261
Sending.

150
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,261
"Sending"

151
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,261
"Message sent"

152
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,261
However, that was a very mismatched towel.

153
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:54,461
Because you'll never find horsehair crabs in a lake.

154
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,861
Is that so?

155
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,261
Horsehair crabs only live in the sea.

156
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:01,061
"Su wa ko" (Lake Suwa),

157
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:02,461
"ke gani" (Horsehair crab),

158
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:03,661
"ta o ru" (towel).

159
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,461
I can't do without it.

160
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:14,661
I see.

161
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:17,761
So that's what he meant.

162
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,361
Haibara.

163
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:20,961
Don't tell me...

164
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,461
You already figured something out?

165
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:25,661
How'd you know?

166
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:29,161
Because you just showed the same expression as Conan.

167
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,361
How rude...

168
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,961
But, it's true that, I've figured it out.

169
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,761
That he was right all along.

170
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:45,461
Conan was right, you say?

171
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:49,861
So the man and woman just now really are bad guys?

172
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:54,061
Yes, pretending to be Masao's real parents,

173
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,161
they're up to no good, don't you think?

174
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:59,361
But, how did you figure that out?

175
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,961
It's the karuta cards Masao collected.

176
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:05,961
The four cards told us so.

177
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:13,361
Which means, in order to only collect those four cards,

178
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:15,161
he had positioned those cards beforehand

179
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:18,861
so that they would've been easy for him to grab.

180
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,261
Then he headed to the restroom

181
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,761
with the woman who was faking to be his mother.

182
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:25,361
It was all to help the rest of us figure it out.

183
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:30,361
The secret code he had constructed.

184
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:34,461
Well, unfortunately the first "ni" card he tried to grab.

185
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,161
I was the first to take this.

186
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,661
No way. I'll never let you have it.

187
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,061
Because this "ni" card is my card.

188
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:44,561
Resulted in a tug-of-war with Genta.

189
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,961
But what does it mean?

190
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,561
The four cards.

191
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,661
Masao told us, didn't he?

192
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:53,561
The key to solving the code.

193
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,861
By saying, "I can't do it without that."

194
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,961
So... you mean...

195
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:01,361
The towel with the horsehair crab from Lake Suwa?

196
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,761
Yes, "Su wa ko" (Lake Suwa), "ke ga ni" (horsehair crab)

197
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:06,161
and "ta o ru" (towel) all have three syllables.

198
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:10,161
Change the middle syllable of each "wa", "ga" and "o"

199
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,061
into the particles "ha", "go", "wo",

200
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,961
and think along these lines.

201
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,861
What are "party something", anyway?

202
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:18,761
Do you mean "party girls"?

203
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:23,161
They are words used between nouns in connective sentences

204
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:25,561
that show relation or attach meaning.

205
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:30,161
For example, Genta "wa" otoko da (Genta "is" a boy).

206
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,861
I see.

207
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:35,061
"Su wa ko" should be "su is ko".

208
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,161
So isn't it telling us "su" is represented by "ko"?

209
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,061
Then "ke ga ni" means

210
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:44,161
to treat "ke" as if it were "ni", right?

211
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,461
In that case, "ta o ru" means

212
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:49,261
"ta" is changed into "ru".

213
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:52,861
Yes, so taking that into account,

214
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:56,661
try reading the four characters.

215
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:58,661
Leaving the last "te",

216
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,461
which doesn't fall under any of the rules, as is.

217
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,961
We make the first "ru" into "ta".

218
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,261
And the next "ko" is actually "su".

219
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:10,261
And if we think of the third card, "ni", as "ke"...

220
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,961
It means "Help"!

221
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,061
That's right.

222
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:21,361
Those two pretending to be Masao's real parent

223
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:24,161
are bad guys scheming who-knows-what.

224
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,161
So Masao is pleading to us for help.

225
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,861
But wait...

226
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:32,861
This isn't another lie again, is it?

227
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,261
He's got a point.

228
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:36,461
It's possible this could be an elaborate prank.

229
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,761
Fools.

230
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,861
Would he have used a code like this

231
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:43,061
that he couldn't be sure we'd be able to solve as a prank?

232
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,261
This is a secret code made

233
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:47,761
so that the woman faking as his mother wouldn't catch on.

234
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,061
Plus, that child,

235
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,861
when we were about to be turned away at the door,

236
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,461
he was frightened.

237
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:01,061
But, where could Masao's real parents be, then?

238
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,961
I don't know about his father, but...

239
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:05,361
As far as his mother,

240
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,961
I can make a fair guess.

241
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:09,961
For real?

242
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:13,961
Masao, said something odd besides

243
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,261
"the towel of the horsehair crab from Lake Suwa", didn't he?

244
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,861
Something odd?

245
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,761
That's right, didn't he say he was good at karuta cards,

246
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,461
but it turned out he really suck at playing.

247
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:25,461
The reason for that was just because he had to collect

248
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,261
those four cards above all else.

249
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,661
Could it be, when he was going to the restroom and said,

250
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:33,261
"Mommy, restroom" in a spoiled tone?

251
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,361
That was also only because

252
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,761
he had wanted to get that woman away from here

253
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:39,961
and have us solve the code.

254
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:43,061
But even if he hadn't deliberately said that,

255
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:46,061
don't you think that woman would've accompanied Masao anyway?

256
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,061
That's true.

257
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,461
If she had let Masao leave by himself,

258
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,061
he might've taken the chance and fled.

259
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:55,861
So he purposely said "Mommy, restroom"

260
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:57,561
in order to make us connect that phrase

261
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,661
with the "help" we figured out earlier.

262
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:02,261
Connect them?

263
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,861
Mommy, restroom.

264
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:06,861
Help.

265
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,661
Could it be?

266
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:11,461
That's kid's mother...

267
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:13,561
They locked her in the restroom?

268
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,961
No way.

269
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,161
Although we lack solid proof,

270
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,261
if we think of it that way,

271
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,261
it'd make sense that the man faking to be his father

272
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,461
has been inside the restroom this whole time.

273
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,061
Then, indeed...

274
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:29,461
We should've just called Officer Takagi in the first place.

275
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:35,661
Just as that cold-ridden detective had instructed.

276
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:38,561
"Mouri Detective Agency"

277
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,161
You must be sweating up a storm.

278
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,461
I brought a change of clothes...

279
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:44,761
Conan?

280
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,661
But with that fever...

281
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:48,561
Where could he have gone?

282
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,961
"Sorry, I'll be back soon. From Conan" -Geez.

283
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,704
But then, how are you going to save her,

284
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:03,904
the mother who is locked in the restroom?

285
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,604
No, before that...

286
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,904
we have to do something about that woman

287
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:09,204
who's pretending to be his mother.

288
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:12,204
Hey, if we don't decide on a strategy soon,

289
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,304
they'll be back before we know it.

290
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,804
It'll be fine.

291
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,904
There's no need to rescue or capture anyone.

292
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:19,904
What?

293
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:23,204
All we need to do is to finish playing this round of karuta cards

294
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,604
and leave.

295
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:27,304
So, we won't do anything?

296
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:29,104
However...

297
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:31,504
Soon after we leave, we'll call Officer Takagi

298
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:33,004
and explain the situation.

299
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,904
And get him to come and save her.

300
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:37,904
Of course, if you all wanted to show Conan

301
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,404
that we can handle without him,

302
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,004
and just the four of us make a reckless gamble,

303
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,404
that's another story altogether.

304
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,304
No, no, no, no,

305
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:48,904
Hey.

306
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,004
Whose cell phone is that?

307
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,104
Wonder whose it is?

308
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,704
It's not mine.

309
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,604
It's not mine, either.

310
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,504
Don't tell me...

311
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,504
Very keen.

312
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,604
That's my cell phone.

313
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:19,304
I left it there while the line was still connected.

314
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:25,804
Of course, I was on the other end of the line.

315
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:29,104
Thanks to you, now I know full well,

316
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,004
that you aren't just normal brats

317
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:34,104
but bothersome pets that can't be allowed to leave here.

318
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:36,404
And where is Masao?

319
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,204
I don't see him.

320
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:40,904
As far that boy,

321
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:42,904
he is keeping his mother company

322
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:45,704
as I tied him up in the restroom as well.

323
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,904
Well, at any rate,

324
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:50,804
you guys will soon join them in that same restroom.

325
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:55,304
You, girl, with the hair band.

326
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:59,504
Tie your friends up with that sticky tape.

327
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,404
After all that's done,

328
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,604
I'll tie you up myself.

329
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:07,304
Well, if you don't like that idea...

330
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:13,304
We have other ways of rendering you immobile.

331
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:17,004
You'll be fine.

332
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:19,204
As soon as we finish our business,

333
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,404
we'll leave you all alone.

334
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,704
If you're lucky and the real man of this household

335
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:28,504
comes back from his business trip early,

336
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,504
he may be able to help you.

337
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,804
My, what could it be?

338
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,604
That "business" of yours.

339
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,904
Well, there's no telling, is there?

340
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,604
Hey, hurry and answer it.

341
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:47,604
Yes, sure.

342
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,604
Hey, could that be...

343
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,804
Conan, right?

344
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,804
Hello.

345
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,604
I'm from the post office.

346
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:58,204
Is this Mr. Uemura from Room 2806?

347
00:17:58,204 --> 00:17:59,904
Yes, it is.

348
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,304
Regarding a registered mail you sent for delivery,

349
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,104
the addressee was unavailable,

350
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:06,404
so we were unable to deliver it.

351
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:09,204
Yes, it seems they've moved.

352
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:10,804
In that case, since this is registered mail,

353
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:14,304
may I have your permission to directly return it to you?

354
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:16,604
Sure, I'm buzzing you up now.

355
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:21,304
So it wasn't Conan.

356
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:25,904
I thought he'd come for us after he read the email we sent.

357
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,604
But, I've finally figured it out

358
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:32,604
that you two are trying to destroy evidence pertaining to tax evasion.

359
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,904
The sender of that registered mail

360
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,904
was the previous resident of this apartment, the one named Uemura,

361
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:40,304
who was a former employee of the Isobe Corporation,

362
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:43,504
now under suspicion of tax evasion.

363
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:44,904
The contents of the registered mail

364
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,904
are probably whistle-blower documents,

365
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:50,104
or account books with evidence of tax evasion.

366
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:52,304
It was sent approximately two weeks ago,

367
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,304
in exchange for a reward,

368
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:57,804
to a producer at Nichiuri TV named Hida.

369
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:02,504
The employee planned to move from here and go into hiding.

370
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:06,304
But that producer ended up in a car accident

371
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:09,104
and couldn't receive the registered mail due to being hospitalized.

372
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:13,504
Since the post office holds on to mail for more or less ten days.

373
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:16,204
You calculated the time of its return.

374
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:19,604
And plotted to pose as Uemura who had lived here before,

375
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:22,704
and snatch away that registered mail.

376
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,904
Then, what happened to that Mr. Uemura?

377
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:28,004
Probably confined somewhere else,

378
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:31,404
or already murdered.

379
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,704
And made to look like an accident,

380
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,704
similar to the Nichiuri TV producer.

381
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:40,304
My, look at you, so I was right on the mark.

382
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:49,304
He's at the door.

383
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,304
Take it from him.

384
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,804
Sure.

385
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:58,904
Anyway, as for what we'll do with you...

386
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:02,804
I suppose we'll decide after we've checked out the registered mail.

387
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:16,304
Did something happen?

388
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:17,304
Hey.

389
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,704
Hey, Conan, don't go in before me...

390
00:20:29,704 --> 00:20:31,604
Cuff that woman, hurry.

391
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:32,604
Okay.

392
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:35,704
Conan!

393
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,704
Where's the woman that was here?

394
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:48,304
I put her to sleep with my tranquilizer gun.

395
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:50,804
And she's being handcuffed right now,

396
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:53,904
by Officer Takagi who's dressed in that mailman disguise.

397
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,204
By the way, if you're asking

398
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:59,604
why Officer Takagi is dressed like that...

399
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,004
You read the email I sent and deduced

400
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:06,804
that they were after the returned registered mail, no?

401
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,604
Never mind that, how did you figure it out?

402
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:12,604
That those two people weren't really Masao's parents.

403
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,504
Didn't you only see them through the video call?

404
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:17,304
Yes, it's because...

405
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,204
when I saw their hairlines,

406
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:22,504
I noticed only Masao has a window's peak.

407
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:24,604
The window's peak is a dominant trait,

408
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:27,704
so parents without window's peaks could never have given birth to him.

409
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,604
Are you guys all right?

410
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:40,704
The bad guys have been caught, so you can relax.

411
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:44,904
I hope you learn from this

412
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,604
and don't tell pointless lies ever again.

413
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:53,704
Yes, I'll never tell another lie as long as I live.

414
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:58,904
Could it be another lie in the same breath?

415
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:28,304
"Tax Evasion Charges" "Two days later"

416
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:30,604
So the president was indeed arrested.

417
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:33,804
Well, since he even went as far as to hire those two

418
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:36,404
to destroy the evidence, it only stands to reason.

419
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:38,304
And it looks like Mr. Uemura who had been confined

420
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,204
has also been rescued.

421
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:42,404
Isn't this great?

422
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:48,204
Don't tell me you guys

423
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:53,504
all caught a cold from me, did you?

424
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:55,804
My cold is completely gone, though.

425
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,004
Everyone, take care not to catch a cold.
