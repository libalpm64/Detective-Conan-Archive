1
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:06,531
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:07,987
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,431
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:14,331
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:17,531
Just a planned, Kir is returned to the Organization,

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:21,531
but he is suspected by Gin and ordered to kill Akai.

7
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,931
The murder that occurred in New Beika Hotel was...

8
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:30,331
Are you sure we can get the culprit that way?

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,431
Yep, because it's a spell that Shinichi told me about,

10
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:36,331
so I'm sure it'll work.

11
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,017
When all four get here,

12
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,431
I start by saying...

13
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,531
Shiraunplee!

14
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:56,931
Thanks to the magic spell, the case was solved smoothly.

15
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,231
In the meantime,

16
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:04,043
FBI agent Akai was being summoned by Kir of the Black Organization,

17
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:07,531
also known as CIA informant Rena Mizunashi,

18
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:11,231
and heading towards the specified meeting place, Raiha Pass.

19
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,231
Sizzling hot suspense.

20
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,831
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

21
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,631
The final gun shot echoes through the ridge.

22
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:33,831
What will become of FBI agent, Shuichi Akai?

23
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:35,331
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:36,931
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,031
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:13,175
"Red and Black Crash: Killed on Duty"

27
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,223
CIA?

28
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,575
Just what're you talking about?

29
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:08,227
What does that have to do with you, Sis?

30
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,229
Hey, wait! I don't get it!

31
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,231
Huh? Hey...

32
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,475
I'm not finished talking to you yet.

33
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:17,575
Ei-chan.

34
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:23,875
Father.

35
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,245
Don't give up, Hidemi.

36
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,675
If you keep on waiting,

37
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,375
friends will surely appear.

38
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,975
Promise you'll complete my mission for me.

39
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,175
What...

40
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,975
What's up?

41
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:26,305
Coming from the opposite direction.

42
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,075
I got a head start

43
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:32,311
and checked up on a lot of things.

44
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,075
Really?

45
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,315
And...

46
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,875
Were you able to get what you wanted?

47
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,875
The confirmation that I came here alone.

48
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,575
Yeah.

49
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:50,329
I guess you did.

50
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:54,875
And what information are you giving me

51
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,337
in exchange for helping you whip off?

52
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,975
Yes. The thing I can give you is...

53
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,401
Porsche 356A.

54
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,407
So, that's the story.

55
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:19,675
What's up, Kir?

56
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,975
Finish him off quick.

57
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,423
But...

58
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,875
I shot him through his lungs,

59
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,175
so he'll die if left as is in about 30 minutes.

60
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,431
His head...

61
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:37,075
Shoot the bullet through his head.

62
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:41,075
And see that he completely stops breathing.

63
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,443
Roger.

64
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,475
I didn't think I was going to end here.

65
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,175
I'm surprised too

66
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:11,175
that everything worked out so smoothly.

67
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:40,499
Police.

68
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,775
It seems that there was an accident nearby.

69
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,509
Kir, get rid of him and split.

70
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,975
Roger.

71
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:02,521
I had no choice...

72
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,553
What the...

73
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,275
Hurry, contact the station!

74
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:39,375
Yes, sir!

75
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,075
Why? Why aren't you answering

76
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:59,075
when the cellphone that I borrowed from Conan is finally connecting?

77
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,075
Huh?

78
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:02,575
Shu's not answering the phone.

79
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,975
Maybe he's taking a cat nap.

80
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,575
Mr. Akai didn't seem to have much sleep

81
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,575
since the start of this case.

82
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,175
I tell you...

83
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,575
What shall we do, Conan?

84
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,175
You said before that when we, the FBI withdraw from the hospital,

85
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:17,775
you wanted to come, right?

86
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,475
Yeah.

87
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,675
Would you like to come with us now?

88
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,775
I was thinking of doing so,

89
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:25,575
but I guess it would be a bother

90
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,607
to have a kid running around too.

91
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,875
Besides, today is Friday, the 13th.

92
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,275
I think it would be better for me

93
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,175
to head on home and hit the sack.

94
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:38,617
See you later, Jodie.

95
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,575
Friday the 13th?

96
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,075
Huh?

97
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,375
Be careful.

98
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:50,629
I have this bad feeling today.

99
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,375
Oh, it's because today is Friday the 13th, right?

100
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,775
I don't believe in such things.

101
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,475
I see.

102
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,067
Huh?

103
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:20,167
Shu... Shu was summoned by Rena Mizunashi and went to see her?

104
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,167
Yeah.

105
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:26,665
He got a call from her right after you left.

106
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,667
He said he'd be seeing her, just the two of them.

107
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,167
Just the two of them...

108
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,267
I'm sure it's a trap!

109
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,673
Why didn't you stop him?

110
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,267
Well, I did, actually.

111
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,677
He insisted that he had to go,

112
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,667
because if he didn't, her life would be in danger.

113
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,567
But, Akai can handle himself well,

114
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,967
so, I don't think there's need for worry.

115
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:48,267
That...

116
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:52,167
They were going to meet in Raiha Pass, right?

117
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,667
Yeah.

118
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:57,067
I saw on the TV news just now

119
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,867
that a car was up in flames at Raiha Pass

120
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,701
and a burnt body seems to have been found inside.

121
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,167
-Huh? -What?

122
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,667
The car that went up in flames was a black Chevy,

123
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,167
and found inside was a man in his 20's or 30's.

124
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,867
The car was found by a police officer

125
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,715
who was coincidentally on his way to another scene of an accident.

126
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,717
According to an eye-witness report by that officer,

127
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,667
he says that the car suddenly exploded right in front of his eyes.

128
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:25,067
And from the fact that the body seems to have been shot,

129
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:28,367
the police is investigating this case as homicide.

130
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,067
They hope to identify the body by what little is left of the license plate

131
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,067
and the right hand of the body...

132
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,167
No! That isn't Shu!

133
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,167
He set someone from the Organization up in his place!

134
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,737
I'm sure that he would do so!

135
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,167
I agree!

136
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,741
"Car fire, Mysterious gunshot" -I'm sure we can confirm things easily

137
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,743
if we go to the police department!

138
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:49,667
But, can we make confirmation when the body is burnt?

139
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,667
If the right hand of the body is still there,

140
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,753
we could confirm by matching it to Akai's fingerprints.

141
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,467
Then, we could match it to Akai's fingerprints

142
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:58,757
that are registered at the FBI.

143
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,759
We'd like to match fingerprints,

144
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,367
so please lend us his right hand

145
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:06,567
because he maybe one of our agents.

146
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,167
Is that what we're going to say?

147
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,367
The same goes for Akai's Chevy.

148
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,467
I'm sure that his fingerprints would be somewhere on it,

149
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:16,567
but now that it's gone up in flames,

150
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,767
it'll be retrieved by the police.

151
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,767
We couldn't possibly tell them to give it to us,

152
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,781
without explaining the reasons.

153
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:28,567
If we could only find a way to match his fingerprints

154
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,791
with that of the dead body without being suspected.

155
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,067
If we use the cell phone with his fingerprints on it,

156
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,167
I'm sure we can successfully match the fingerprints.

157
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,567
But, his cell phone is...

158
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,467
This is a cell phone that I borrowed from Conan, but...

159
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,567
I'll go out side then and call him on the phone.

160
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,967
I think he'll come right away.

161
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,167
Even for you,

162
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,067
that's something that cannot be done.

163
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,567
This is work for us, the FBI.

164
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,167
We can't involved an ordinary citizen

165
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,827
more than we already have.

166
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,829
But...

167
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,833
Leave the rest up to us.

168
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,467
Then, you have Akai's fingerprints?

169
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,567
Yes.

170
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,667
I'll take this and go to the police.

171
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,967
Wait, let me give you a lift.

172
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,267
I hate to repeat myself,

173
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,567
but make sure you don't tell anyone

174
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,167
that the body is one of the members of the FBI.

175
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,867
No, I won't tell

176
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,467
and I'll make sure no one suspects me either.

177
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:47,667
Huh? He could be the man who picked up your cell phone?

178
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,867
You mean the man who was just found burnt to death?

179
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:56,567
Yes, I was coincidentally driving through Raiha Pass today too.

180
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,367
We had lunch at a drive-in nearby.

181
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,167
But, I must've for some reason dropped it then.

182
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,467
And this man seems to have picked my cell phone up for me.

183
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,267
That man was also riding a Chevy,

184
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,967
so I thought that maybe if it were him.

185
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,667
I could be of help to the investigation

186
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,167
since I remember what he was wearing as well as his face.

187
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,467
I see.

188
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,897
Then please let me have it.

189
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:25,567
That cell phone is what I borrowed from Conan.

190
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,907
So, I think that my fingerprints as well as Conan's are on it too.

191
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,267
I understand.

192
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:31,967
I'll check it right away,

193
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,867
so please wait right here.

194
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:44,923
We've got the results.

195
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,188
And...

196
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:52,188
was I mistaken after all?

197
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,288
Thank you for going out of your way to come.

198
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,788
No problem.

199
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:04,943
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

200
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,988
Not being able to remember clearly the characteristics of that man.

201
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:12,688
Oh, but that body has many unexplainable points to it.

202
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,288
So, please let us know

203
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:15,588
if you recall anything else.

204
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:16,955
Yes, of course.

205
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:22,488
Okay, then, thank you so much for everything today.

206
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,688
As a result of the investigation,

207
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,988
just as you had mentioned,

208
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,588
your fingerprints together with Conan were also found

209
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,988
with the fingerprints of the man

210
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,588
who just burned to death a while ago.

211
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,988
From the looks of it,

212
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:47,288
I guess the body was Akai after all.

213
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:54,788
But, we couldn't possibly blame Rena Mizunashi either.

214
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:58,088
She would've been killed if she didn't kill him

215
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:01,988
and it seems she told Akai that...

216
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,788
No matter what happens,

217
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:06,788
the mission of the CIA is top priority to not be offended,

218
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:10,788
even if it turns out to be inconvenient for the FBI.

219
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,388
So...

220
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:18,588
Now we've been able to drive a wedge into the Organization.

221
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:21,588
A steel wedge that can never be removed.

222
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,988
Maybe Akai...

223
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:29,988
deliberately became a scapegoat to drive this wedge in.

224
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:36,388
But, the price was much too high to pay.

225
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,388
Shu...

226
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,047
What?

227
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:53,688
I got the blind spot of the rifle.

228
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:57,988
When did you...

229
00:17:57,988 --> 00:18:02,688
Throw down your gun...

230
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,688
If you don't, I'm going to blow your head off.

231
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,388
The sound of a pump?

232
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,071
A shot gun?

233
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,073
Okay, Calvados,

234
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,788
we'll take her from both sides.

235
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:21,088
Oh no...

236
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,288
They're coming from behind.

237
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,788
Go on, Calvados.

238
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:42,588
Use that Remington of yours

239
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,288
to blow over that little kitty of the FBI.

240
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:49,107
Oh, so that guy's name is...

241
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,888
Calvados.

242
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:58,888
He had a rifle, a shotgun and three pistols on him.

243
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:04,188
So I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

244
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:06,188
Shuichi Akai?

245
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,388
Shu.

246
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,988
Don't kill her, Shu!

247
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:32,188
Blowing up the gas tank

248
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:35,153
using the side mirror from that position.

249
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,588
Quite a marksman.

250
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,688
Shu.

251
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,288
This is no time to be amazed!

252
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:44,288
They took the hostage and fled!

253
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:47,165
You should never leave your keys in the car.

254
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,888
Okay, I'll leave the rest to you.

255
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,188
I can't afford to come face to face

256
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:59,177
with that brown-haired girl yet, you see.

257
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,187
Shu.

258
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:13,191
You haven't finished doing all you have to do yet, have you?

259
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:23,488
Shu...

260
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:08,588
We don't need two bullets.

261
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:12,688
One bullet is enough

262
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,088
to get rid of Silver Bread.

263
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:50,488
Here you go.

264
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:53,351
The cell phone that I borrowed from you.

265
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,688
Huh? You don't need it already?

266
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,355
No, thank you.

267
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:58,588
That cell phone in question...

268
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:01,359
We're going to have to keep it here for a while,

269
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,361
so could you hand this cell phone

270
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:06,688
that's the same type as his for the time being?

271
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:08,388
If you have the SIM card over there,

272
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,688
he should have no problem using it.

273
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:14,988
Okay, thank you, Conan.

274
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,588
The serial number is different.

275
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,488
Oh, Jodie.

276
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:29,788
What?

277
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:32,288
Oh, that...

278
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,988
Hang in there.

279
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,393
Yes, I will.

280
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:41,988
Hey, Conan!

281
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,401
Just what're you doing?

282
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,188
You're going to be tardy for school!

283
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:53,688
Okay!

284
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,060
Next Conan's Hint:

285
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,423
Hair.

286
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,352
-Ready go. -Next, an incident occurs at a beauty salon.

287
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:09,864
-Now, cut! -Great cut.

288
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:56,680
Right?
