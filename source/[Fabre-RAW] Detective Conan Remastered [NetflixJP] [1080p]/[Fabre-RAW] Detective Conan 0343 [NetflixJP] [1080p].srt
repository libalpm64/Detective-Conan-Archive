1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,040
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,940
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,940
The bright convenience store that we all frequently go to.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,740
Something happens in the back of the store.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,660
Yes, this is the Mouri.

9
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,460
Oh, Conan?

10
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,960
Where are you? It's already late.

11
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,960
You're going to stay over at Dr. Agasa's house tonight?

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Yep, Haibara's cold got worse because of me

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,560
so I want to take care of her.

14
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,060
Okay, but what about your change of clothes and school things?

15
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,560
Yep! Don't worry. I brought them all here.

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
Besides, it's almost winter vacation.

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
May I, Ran?

18
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,060
Okay! Take good care of her now.

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,960
Thank you, Ran.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,260
See you!

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,060
You don't have to spend the night here

22
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,460
to take care of Ai, Shinichi.

23
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,260
I can take care of her myself.

24
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,660
No.

25
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,060
It's because there have been a lot of

26
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,160
weird people around us lately.

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,760
I feel like something disturbing may happen soon.

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,960
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 1)"

29
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,960
Who are you?

30
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Teacher.

31
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,460
Jodie?

32
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,660
You look very tired, but are you okay?

33
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,460
Oh, yes!

34
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,760
I understand that you may be having a tough time

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,260
with the bad behavior of the brats of Japan,

36
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,060
but don't let them get to you!

37
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,060
No! No! They're all good students!

38
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,560
I'll have to say goodbye to all of you soon.

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,360
It's so very sad.

40
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,160
Jodie, you're going to quit?

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,760
No!

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,860
She has some family affairs to attend to,

43
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,160
so she'll be leaving us at the end of this month

44
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,960
to return to the U.S.

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,160
I wonder what her real affair is all about.

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,660
I wonder.

47
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,560
Although it was only for a short time,

48
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,060
I really enjoyed studying together with all of you!

49
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm sure that you'll be going through a lot of things

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
from now on too,

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,760
but I know that you'll all pull through!

52
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,060
So, good luck and stick it out!

53
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,160
Jodie.

54
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,760
Jodie.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,260
Isn't it about time you tell us?

56
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,860
Tell you what?

57
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,960
The reason why you're quitting school.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,660
What is this family affair that you're referring to?

59
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh! That's a lie!

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,760
The truth is I've been looking for something for a long time.

61
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,160
It's a map of a very precious treasure

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,260
and I finally found it.

63
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,860
Well, I think I found it!

64
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,860
A treasure map?

65
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,960
Maybe she's talking about her first love?

66
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,260
But if so, I don't think she'd say map

67
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,960
because it would be the treasure itself that's precious.

68
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,660
Oh, wait, Jodie!

69
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,760
You're not making sense!

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,260
No! It's a secret!

71
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,760
I can't tell you two!

72
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,860
A secret makes a woman a woman!

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,060
-Okay? -Okay.

74
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
But, how disappointing.

75
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,160
I really wish he could've taken your classes too.

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,660
"He"?

77
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,860
Oh! You mean Shinichi?

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,060
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,560
Let him be!

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,160
He leaves his wife all alone

81
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,560
saying that he has cases to solve, the pits.

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,960
He would never be able to appreciate the merits of Jodie's lessons!

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,260
Wife...

84
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,260
I mean how long is he going to take to solve one case.

85
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,860
He should just give up and come home.

86
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,060
No way, he would never.

87
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,860
He'll never run from something part way.

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,860
Because he loves to put on airs.

89
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,960
Oh, that's the thing you love, love, love about him.

90
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,160
-Just totally irresistible. -Excuse me!

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm just saying that he likes to put on airs and is stubborn.

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
Who cares if he comes home or not?

93
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,060
Oh! Talking about coming home, did the cool kid come home?

94
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,160
-What? You mean, Conan? -That brat with glasses?

95
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Yes! He's always at Dr. Agasa's house when I call recently!

96
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,460
You mean he ran away from home? How sassy of him.

97
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,860
-Next time I see him, I'll... -No!

98
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,260
He's taking care of Ai.

99
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,660
He says that he's to blame for Ai catching a cold,

100
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,260
so he's going to take care of her until she recovers completely

101
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,360
and brought his change of clothes and everything over.

102
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,760
Oh, you mean that brat has a soft side too.

103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,660
Well, sorry.

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,460
Right! Why don't we go to Jodie's condo and have a party?

105
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,560
What is it, all of a sudden?

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,060
Party?

107
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,760
A small farewell party for you, Jodie!

108
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,360
We can buy snacks and drinks at the convenience store!

109
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,660
Sounds great!

110
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,060
-What do you say, Jodie? -Okay!

111
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,660
Let's go to the convenience store in front of the station then!

112
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,960
Oh, the one that Aya is working at!

113
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,660
Aya?

114
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,060
Was there a student by that name?

115
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,260
She's our classmate when we were in intermediate school!

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,360
She's a cheerful girl, so I'm sure you'll like her too!

117
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,360
Thank you very much!

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,860
Welcome!

119
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,260
-Excuse me. -Yes?

120
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Is there a girl by the name of Aya Nanakawa working here?

121
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,160
Oh.

122
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
She's inside with the shopkeeper.

123
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,360
How many times do I have to tell you?

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,460
During peak hours, we're desperate and need all the help we can get.

125
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,760
It seems we're just going to have to hire someone new

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,660
to take your place.

127
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,160
Oh, no.

128
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,060
What's wrong, Aya?

129
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,760
Ran.

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,060
-Ran! -Aya.

131
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,360
What's the matter, Aya?

132
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,060
Who are you people?

133
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,860
Friends!

134
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,060
I'm a high school teacher!

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,860
What seems to be the matter?

136
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,960
A lot's the matter.

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,460
The total sales of the store

138
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,360
and the number of items in the store don't match!

139
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,960
And this happens only when Aya's in charge of closing the store!

140
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,160
How rude!

141
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,060
Why should Aya be blamed for it?

142
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,960
Maybe one of your customers is shoplifting.

143
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,260
Aya tells me that this shop is crowded in the mornings and at nights,

144
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,560
so maybe then...

145
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,860
Yeah, I thought so too,

146
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,160
that's why I set up surveillance cameras

147
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
when this shop was renovated!

148
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,060
I kept very close watch, but there was no such customer.

149
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,360
Then, maybe it was a burglar?

150
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,160
I thought of that too!

151
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,760
That's why last night, I parked my car opposite the store

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,060
and kept watch right through!

153
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,660
But, all I saw was Aya who came out after cleaning the store

154
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,260
and closing the shutter.

155
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,360
Nobody came to the store from then to the following morning

156
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,260
when the store was opened.

157
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,360
When I opened the shop and checked the storeroom,

158
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,660
the figures didn't match.

159
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,760
The only thing thinkable is that Aya stole.

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,360
I didn't steal anything!!

161
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,660
By the way, what was stolen?

162
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,760
A lot of things.

163
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,460
Game software, DVDs, CDs,

164
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,260
lunch boxes and riceballs, mineral water, Oolong tea,

165
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,760
Cokes and snacks including chocolate.

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,360
I can just see young kids gather around,

167
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,860
playing music and games, watching DVDs

168
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,760
and catching their thrills!

169
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,460
True.

170
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,960
But, if Aya were the one,

171
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,060
wouldn't Aya be displayed on the surveillance camera?

172
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,260
The surveillance cameras are set to go off at closing.

173
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,760
Because the electric bills aren't all that cheap either.

174
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Then, the light here is turned off because of that?

175
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,460
Well, I'm trying to economize to regain what I can,

176
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,660
of my losses.

177
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,260
The customers who come to use the restroom

178
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,960
are all regular customers,

179
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,360
so they can find the restroom even if it's dark.

180
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Aya, have you noticed anyone who looks suspicious?

181
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,260
No. I wouldn't say suspicious, but...

182
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,360
There are three customers that I'm concerned about.

183
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
-Huh? -Is something bothering you?

184
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,660
What type of people are they?

185
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,160
They all come to use the toilet a lot.

186
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,060
Tell us more about it!

187
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,860
One looks to be a university student

188
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,960
and occasionally stands and reads game magazines

189
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,160
until almost closing time.

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,060
A game freak.

191
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,560
But, he never bought any games here.

192
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,860
All he buys are cup noodles and pouched food.

193
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,460
Besides, he's pretty selfish,

194
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,460
and cuts in line at the register.

195
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh.

196
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,560
The second one is a man who looks to be a salaried worker.

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,060
He seems to be very timid and is overly hesitant over everything.

198
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,560
Overly hesitant?

199
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,460
Yes, he's always looking down.

200
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,860
Even when the university student I mentioned earlier cuts in line,

201
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,460
he lets him do so without getting angry.

202
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Even when using the restroom, he lets everybody go on before him

203
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,360
saying that he's not in a rush.

204
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
He always buys things like a toothbrush set, batteries,

205
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,060
shaving razor sets and towels.

206
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,460
All things you would take along when traveling.

207
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,760
The third one is a stubborn and thrifty old woman.

208
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,460
Yeah, I know that old lady too.

209
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,760
She asks for discounts on lunches that are almost expired.

210
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
She lectures telling us to compare prices with other stores

211
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,960
and to stay on our balls.

212
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,760
But that old woman's not a bad person!

213
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,160
She turns off unneeded lights,

214
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,260
and also told me what temperature

215
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,560
I should set the air conditioning at, to save money.

216
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,760
Well, she talks all she wants with us

217
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,560
and leaves without buying a thing, though.

218
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,360
Which makes all three of them suspicious.

219
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,960
-Why? -Why do you say that?

220
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,260
Because it could be that the game freak

221
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,560
wanted the game software that he couldn't buy.

222
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
The salaried worker may like to go on trips

223
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,660
and maybe wants snacks to take along with him.

224
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,460
And, the granny could've been checking out

225
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,360
which lunch she wanted to eat without buying anything.

226
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
All three of them have a possibility of being the culprit.

227
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Gosh!

228
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,860
I think that it's more appropriate to suspect Aya

229
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,760
before suspecting the customers.

230
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,060
So, I've been trying to tell you that Aya's not that type of girl!

231
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,960
Give me an explanation then,

232
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,860
of why after scolding Aya last month about the same thing,

233
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,460
the items stopped missing!

234
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,860
-Huh? -Huh? Really?

235
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,360
Yeah.

236
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Since the items stopped missing for a month now,

237
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I was determined to stop watching the store after closing last night.

238
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I figured that Aya finally repented what she did.

239
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,460
But, when I opened the store this morning,

240
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,360
a lot of things were missing again.

241
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,660
She probably couldn't stop herself any longer!

242
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,860
So, if you apologize for what you did up to today,

243
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,260
I'll let you go this time!

244
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,160
If not, you're fired!

245
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Hey, Ran, things look really bad!

246
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,260
Yes.

247
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,460
Right! Why don't you talk about this to Shinichi?

248
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
He can probably solve something like this in no time at all.

249
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,460
But, I don't have his phone number.

250
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,760
His number is never displayed.

251
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,960
How about you, Sonoko, no inspiration at all?

252
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,860
If I was inspired, I wouldn't be saying things like this, would I?

253
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Maybe we can ask Conan?

254
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,360
He always comes up with interesting ideas and notices odd things!

255
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,460
I guess so.

256
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,660
Although it irks me to ask that glasses kid, a bit.

257
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,260
He's at Dr. Agasa's house, so...

258
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,160
Jodie.

259
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,660
It's not good relying on somebody

260
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,560
without trying all we can ourselves first!

261
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,460
Let's try to work things out for her ourselves.

262
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,760
But...

263
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,360
I really haven't stole anything!

264
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,560
You still insist.

265
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,860
You never know when you will lose the one you can rely on, so...

266
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,160
What?

267
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,280
Be honest with me, will you?

268
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
You're the one who did it, right?

269
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,580
You've got me wrong, shopkeeper!

270
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,680
I haven't stolen anything from the store!

271
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm sure Conan would be able to come up with something but...

272
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Are you sure that I shouldn't call him, Jodie?

273
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,380
Yes, I'm sure. The cool kid is busy looking after Ai!

274
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,180
We shouldn't bother him!

275
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,880
I guess so, but...

276
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,980
But if we leave Aya as is...

277
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,480
No!

278
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,280
She'll be fine! We don't have to rely on that kid!

279
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,780
I, the Queen of deduction Sonoko

280
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,280
will solve this case without his help!

281
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Oh? Right.

282
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,880
First, let's organize what went on.

283
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,480
The total sales of this convenience store

284
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,880
and the number of items in the storeroom

285
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
for some reason don't match.

286
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,480
And the items start missing

287
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,380
after Aya is in charge of cleaning the store

288
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,580
and closing the shop.

289
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,680
Therefore, it's only natural that

290
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,180
the shopkeeper suspects Aya of having stolen the items.

291
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,380
But, we've known Aya since intermediate school

292
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,480
and know that she's a good girl.

293
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,580
So, we think there's another culprit and begin investigation.

294
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,180
Everything's okay up to here, right?

295
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,580
Right.

296
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,680
What concerns me are the three customers that Aya referred to.

297
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,780
One is the university student type game freak.

298
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,580
The other is the timid and hesitant salaried worker type man.

299
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,080
And the last one is a stubborn granny.

300
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,480
Each of them buys different things such as...

301
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,980
The game freak buys only cup noodles and pouched food.

302
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,280
The salaried worker buys toothbrush sets, batteries,

303
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,580
shaving razor sets and towels.

304
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,080
They were all things that one would take on trips.

305
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,280
The granny buys nothing!

306
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,580
All she used to do was talk to the personnel of the store

307
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,780
and buy nothing!

308
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,080
All three of them seem suspicious and yet it could be otherwise.

309
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,880
Maybe it's just that somebody shoplifted

310
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
or the store was robbed, after all?

311
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,280
I think that's impossible!

312
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,980
The shopkeeper had surveillance cameras set up.

313
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,480
No chance for burglars. No can do!

314
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,980
The problem is, when she was scolded by the shopkeeper

315
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,580
after he suspected her, the items stopped missing.

316
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,280
And yesterday, a month after that,

317
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,980
again on the day that she is in charge,

318
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,180
a large amount of things were stolen again!

319
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,280
Come to think of it, Aya.

320
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,880
You like snacks and juice, don't you?

321
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,980
You used to be hooked on games too.

322
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,380
Hey!

323
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,580
We're trying to prove Aya's innocence, aren't we?

324
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,580
I know.

325
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,280
Think what he would think at times like this.

326
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,980
What would Shinichi think.

327
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,880
What would he think...

328
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
The point is the discrepancies you find

329
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,080
when compared with the usual situation.

330
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,980
Whenever a case occurs, something is different from the usual.

331
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,980
First, observe very closely and pinpoint what it is.

332
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,580
No matter if it's something that anyone would do,

333
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,180
or something that's so trivial and apt to occur,

334
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,780
if it's different from the usual, it's a great problem!

335
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,680
Those more than usual and plain things

336
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,780
are the most worth noticing as different.

337
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,180
Something different from the usual?

338
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,280
I see. So if the items only start missing when Aya's in charge...

339
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Do you do anything special on the days you're on closing duty, Aya?

340
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,580
Nothing really...

341
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
All I do is clean the store.

342
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,780
Is there anything you noticed, shopkeeper?

343
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,180
No, not really.

344
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,980
Anything, no matter how trivial it may seem!

345
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,080
Sorry...

346
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,280
It's nothing much, but...

347
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,680
What is it?

348
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,280
When Aya is in charge, the inside of the store is especially clean!

349
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,380
See, the boxes with the items inside that arrived just before closing

350
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,280
are all in order!

351
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,280
The other employees and I leave organizing the boxes

352
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,380
to the employees who come in the morning and go home.

353
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,180
It's the same with you too, isn't it, shopkeeper?

354
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,880
She probably did it to rid herself of her guilty conscience,

355
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,680
but I won't be deceived.

356
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
Oh, no.

357
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,780
Even for the lunches.

358
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,280
She probably thought it was okay because all of them

359
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,580
were near the expiration date.

360
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,980
But a thief's a thief!

361
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,280
I could go ahead and call the police and have them investigate!

362
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,780
Hey? The police?

363
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,580
Then what is it?

364
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,980
Are you people going to figure out what's going on?

365
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,780
And capture the real culprit.

366
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,380
Shi...

367
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,180
Shinichi.

368
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,880
Shinichi!

369
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,980
Shinichi!

370
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,380
Ran.

371
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,780
Just my imagination, I guess.

372
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,680
Hey, Shinichi! Where were you?

373
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Nowhere special.

374
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,180
Haibara doesn't seem to be around.

375
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,780
Oh, Ai is in her room.

376
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,080
She's still not all that well, is she?

377
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
She's fine! The heater is on,

378
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,780
and besides, I thought it best to leave her alone.

379
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,880
She's probably listening to that tape again.

380
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:52,980
Shiho, don't you regret what you're trying to do now.

381
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,580
I'm with you all the way!

382
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,080
I'll always be with you, so give it your all.

383
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,780
Mother.

384
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,680
I'll talk to you again on your 19th birthday.

385
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,780
Bye, bye for now. Catch you later.

386
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,580
Oh, and...

387
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,280
Welcome!

388
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,780
Excuse me! The restroom!

389
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,480
Wow, look at the people at the cash register!

390
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,880
Oh my.

391
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,580
It's really starting to get crowded.

392
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,080
Yes, really.

393
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,680
Thank you.

394
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,780
Welcome to our shop.

395
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,280
Even the restroom's starting to get crowded.

396
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,780
Come to think of it, Aya was saying that

397
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,580
the suspicious three customers used to use the restroom a lot.

398
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,880
We'll get back to this after we take care of all these customers.

399
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Go back to the cash register, will you?

400
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,980
Yes, sir.

401
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,580
If you guys have no intention of buying anything,

402
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,080
go on outside, will you?

403
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,580
But...

404
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,480
You're interfering with business!

405
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,080
-Go on. -Wait.

406
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,780
If we leave things as is,

407
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,480
Aya...

408
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
Aya will be blamed as the burglar!

409
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,780
Aya!

410
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,580
Ran, what shall we do?

411
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,180
Shinichi.

412
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,680
What on earth should I do?

413
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,280
Shinichi!

414
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,040
"The restroom of the convenience store"
