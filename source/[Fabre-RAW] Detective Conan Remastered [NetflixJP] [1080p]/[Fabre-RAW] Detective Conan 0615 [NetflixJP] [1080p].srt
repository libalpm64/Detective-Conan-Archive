1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,502
We all came out to pick bamboo shoots

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:07,302
along with Dr. Agasa,

3
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:08,902
but his car broke down

4
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,202
and we ended up being stranded in the mountains.

5
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:15,502
We walked over to a villa district seeking shelter from the rain

6
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:17,402
and were lured to a certain villa

7
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:20,402
by the melody of a piano playing, stepped foot into it.

8
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,003
Although there are traces of someone having been there,

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,002
no one is in sight.

10
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,302
Eerie sentences are written in the diary that is left behind.

11
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:34,902
It seems that someone kidnapped a boy and confined him to the villa.

12
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,702
But, after the kidnapper's identity is revealed,

13
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,802
it seems the kidnapper decides to take the boy's life.

14
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:42,802
We've got to find the boy quickly!

15
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:48,402
Then, the villa is suddenly overtaken by a blackout,

16
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:51,602
when the sound of the piano playing is heard again.

17
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:55,502
Oh no. The kidnapper is still in the villa.

18
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,002
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

19
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:03,502
You must be true to yourself.

20
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,102
The mystery of the diary is solved.

21
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,402
What is the true identity of the genius pianist?

22
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,902
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,002
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:13,102
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:54,998 --> 00:03:00,159
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 2)"

26
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:04,163
That's right! I found a picture!

27
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:08,998
A family picture.

28
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:11,298
They seem to be a musical family.

29
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:14,198
The date on the picture is a year ago.

30
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:16,175
Maybe the child in the middle of the picture

31
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,598
is the one who was kidnapped?

32
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,181
No. Because the child in the picture is a girl besides.

33
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:23,798
He's right. The one in this picture

34
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:27,598
is probably the owner of this villa or...

35
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,189
the kidnapper, no doubt about it.

36
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:31,598
The kidnapper?

37
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,898
No!

38
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:41,098
I'm sure that the key to the case is hidden in this diary.

39
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:46,698
April 20th, sunny.

40
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,198
After talking to him I found out that he's quite a nice boy.

41
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:51,598
He laughs a lot and plays a lot.

42
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,998
I'm not sure if he understands the situation he's in

43
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,797
but there's no doubt that this child

44
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,898
had been oppressed on a daily basis.

45
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:03,498
Either way, only two more days to go, and it'll be over.

46
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:06,698
April 22nd, cloudy.

47
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,998
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven.

48
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:12,231
Melodies that make your heart quiver.

49
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,998
I'm jealous of the talent of the genius born in the same era.

50
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:18,898
Although they're not songs that are appropriate to play in this situation,

51
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:21,298
they help me forget the passing of time.

52
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,798
Just one more day. Please let it pass without incident.

53
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,398
April 23rd, rain. No good.

54
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:33,198
It seems as if this boy somehow knows who I am.

55
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:36,998
If this is revealed, it would be a hindrance in the future.

56
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:38,257
Although I feel sorry for him,

57
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,098
I guess I've got no choice but to kill him.

58
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,198
The last thing written in the dairy is...

59
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,898
April 24th, rain.

60
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:51,098
I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me.

61
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,298
First, what bothers me is

62
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:57,998
why the entry for April the 21st left out.

63
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,198
On April 20th, it's written two more days to go,

64
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:05,498
and on April 22nd it reads one more day.

65
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:09,498
They're connected as if the 21st never was.

66
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:14,098
Moreover, the last entry, April 24th, rain is also strange.

67
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:17,098
This red stain is probably from wine that was spilled

68
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,698
but the pages dried pages are stuck together,

69
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,498
so somebody would've had to write in it

70
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,598
more than an hour before we found this.

71
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,598
Why does it read rain?

72
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:28,298
An hour hasn't passed yet since we got here

73
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,798
and it began to rain.

74
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,198
Besides, this stain.

75
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:36,098
Some sentences are slightly uncovered by the stain after all.

76
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:38,317
It goes to show that it was wet once,

77
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,898
then wet again for some reason.

78
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:41,798
Why?

79
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:49,898
The tips of the staples in the middle are out of alignment.

80
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:52,798
And the holes are also slightly bigger.

81
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:56,698
And, two pages are sticking out of the edge of the diary.

82
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,798
There's a trace of something

83
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:05,398
having been written on the page next to the one sticking out.

84
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:21,498
Hey, Conan?

85
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:26,365
What are you doing rubbing the lead of the pencil against the diary?

86
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,898
-Oh, that's... -Monster Getter's...

87
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:32,371
Treasure map!

88
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:34,373
What's going on?

89
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,898
I still don't have proof, so I can't say for sure, but...

90
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,098
I guess we'll figure out the answer

91
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,698
if we go and check out the room with the piano.

92
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,698
Nobody's here.

93
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,498
I guess the sound of the piano playing

94
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:06,798
was a CD playing just like you said.

95
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:07,798
If it were the radio cassette player,

96
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:10,898
it would move on batteries even during the blackout.

97
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,413
What?

98
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,698
Our things are gone.

99
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:19,198
-No. -No joke?

100
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:23,898
And, what about your deduction?

101
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:26,798
Aren't we supposed to figure something out here?

102
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,431
So I thought but...

103
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,198
I'm completely lost.

104
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,498
Maybe...

105
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,398
we've really got trouble.

106
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,798
Hey, Conan!

107
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,298
Don't tell me you're going to

108
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:46,445
play the piano at a time like this?

109
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,447
The seat of the piano is not right for you.

110
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,998
It was perfect for me, though.

111
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,998
I think you turn the dial that is under this cover

112
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,898
and adjust the height of the seat?

113
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:03,798
And? Is the creepy player of the piano dangerous?

114
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:08,467
Yeah, a very dangerously outstanding genius.

115
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:12,471
That people would resent his birth.

116
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,598
A dangerously outstanding genius?

117
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,477
Is... is this person the one we are up against?

118
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,098
Sort of...

119
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:27,198
Okay! The height of the chair is just about right.

120
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,298
Okay, Ayumi, play the piano

121
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,498
and sing with everyone, will you?

122
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:36,198
A super peppy and cheerful song.

123
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,198
Here goes!

124
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:46,198
"I stepped on a cat, I stepped on a cat,"

125
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,198
"I stepped on a cat, and it scratched me"

126
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,098
"The cat scratched me, the cat scratched me,"

127
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,298
"the cat was scared so it scratched me"

128
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,198
"Bad, bad cat"

129
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,798
"Let's cut off its claws"

130
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,998
Why don't we quit playing

131
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:03,897
hide-and-seek already?

132
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,525
Whoever you are?

133
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:17,397
Don't worry, we're on your friends.

134
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:20,798
Wow, amazing.

135
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,998
It's just as Conan said!

136
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:27,298
It was really a child!

137
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:31,598
The lights are back on.

138
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:34,897
Okay, so we're all ears.

139
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:37,897
First, tell us your name

140
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,698
and age.

141
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:53,202
My name is Keita Onoda. I'm 7.

142
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,902
7? Then, you're in first grade?

143
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,102
"Keita Onoda (7)" -Yep!

144
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:59,802
Haido Elementary 1st grade, class 3!

145
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,302
You're a 1st grader just like us?

146
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:06,302
But, how did you figure out that he was a child, Conan?

147
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:09,302
First the names Bach, Mozart, Chopin

148
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:10,589
and Beethoven that were written in the diary.

149
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,102
Melodies that make your heart quiver.

150
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,302
A genius born in the same era.

151
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:18,597
I envy that genius. These sentences mean...

152
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:22,202
Chopin was born 60 years after Bach died.

153
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:26,102
So, he couldn't be a genius who was born in the same era, right?

154
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:29,602
It was a mystery who was being indicated here,

155
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:33,102
but when I looked at this picture that Ayumi picked up, it hit me.

156
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:38,402
That the one who was kidnapped was a genius piano player the same age

157
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,802
as the girl in the picture.

158
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:43,302
The kidnapper probably kidnapped the boy

159
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,902
and confined him in his own villa, so that his daughter

160
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,902
who is going to participate in the Beckahm International Music Contest

161
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:49,202
or something that is to be held

162
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:51,302
at the end of April, gets to win the contest.

163
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,102
His own?

164
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,202
You mean this is the villa of the kidnapper?

165
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,637
Yeah, because the room with the piano in the picture

166
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,902
is the same room we're in right now.

167
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:03,102
According to what's written in the diary,

168
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:04,302
is the one who kidnapped you

169
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:07,602
the father of the girl in the picture?

170
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:10,302
Yeah, he's Chiaki's father.

171
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,402
I met him for the first time,

172
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:15,602
but I knew his face. Chiaki showed me his picture.

173
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:18,657
But, I wasn't kidnapped!

174
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:22,102
Chiaki's father saved me!

175
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:23,902
The contest was drawing close

176
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:26,202
so I had to practice the piano day

177
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,402
in and day out and I couldn't have any fun for a long time!

178
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,002
That's why you did things that you were usually

179
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:31,802
not allowed to do without being scolded,

180
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,102
like eating snacks while walking along the corridor,

181
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:37,802
playing on the cart and get carried away playing games.

182
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:38,677
Yep!

183
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:42,681
Riding the cart through the corridor really feels good!

184
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:46,302
Then, who was the tall person I saw?

185
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:50,702
This boy was probably leaning over the handle

186
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:52,402
of the cart and looking inside.

187
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:53,802
I see!

188
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,902
Food was messed up on the kitchen table

189
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:58,697
because you got hungry and the man

190
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:02,102
who brought you here fled and disappeared, right?

191
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:04,502
Yep! I ate the ham, bread

192
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,302
and fried chicken that were in the refrigerator.

193
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:08,402
Because I can't cook.

194
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:11,102
This room with the piano sure is nice and neat.

195
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,502
That's probably because he was told by

196
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:16,502
his parents not to mess up this room no matter what.

197
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,502
Yep! Mommy told me

198
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:21,702
that the God of Music is in the piano room.

199
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:24,002
That's why you returned the seat of the piano back

200
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:26,202
to its originally height after you finished playing the piano?

201
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:27,302
Yep!

202
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:28,727
When all of you got here, at first,

203
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:31,302
I was so surprised that I forgot to do it.

204
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:34,302
I see. That's why you were flustered.

205
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:35,802
Because although you were sure that the piano player

206
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,902
was a child, the height of the piano chair

207
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,602
was not adjusted to child size.

208
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:44,502
Yeah, because I didn't think you could change the height of the chair.

209
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,902
But, did the culprit really flee?

210
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,702
According to the diary, the culprit wrote,

211
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,202
"I've got no choice but to kill him because he knows me".

212
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:56,002
Then, on the next day, it reads, "Sonny, forgive me".

213
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:59,102
It's true that if both days were connected,

214
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:03,402
it would seem as if he had no choice but to kill,

215
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:06,202
and so did, but both pages weren't connected.

216
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,902
Because he switched the pages.

217
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,773
He did so because he ran out of paper

218
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,775
and drew this treasure map in the diary,

219
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:20,102
then he ripped the page off!

220
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,802
See, there are two pages that

221
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,785
are sticking out from the edge, aren't there?

222
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:28,302
True.

223
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:31,102
That's proof that the pages were switched!

224
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,802
Just what do you mean?

225
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:37,502
This diary is the type that is stapled together in the middle.

226
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:40,799
If all the pages are the same size, when the diary is closed,

227
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,802
depending on the thickness of how many

228
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,803
pages are stacked up, the edges will stick out.

229
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,402
The diary is made so that the edges

230
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:50,302
that are sticking out are cut to even them out.

231
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:54,002
The result is, the outer pages are slightly

232
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,502
larger than those in the middle.

233
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,402
That's why if you bring the outer pages to the middle,

234
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,821
it sticks out like this!

235
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:05,302
The reason why the staple tips on the middle page

236
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,102
are not aligned together is because of this as well.

237
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:10,829
Since he pried the staples apart once and switched the page

238
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:14,833
and pressed them back down, causing the staples to misalign.

239
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,802
The page in question where he drew the treasure map,

240
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:22,502
is on the right hand side of the April 24th page with the wine stain.

241
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,202
And on the backside of the 24th

242
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:27,802
the contents of April 23rd should've been written.

243
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:30,102
But if only that page were to be removed,

244
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,202
when the owner decides to write the diary for the following day,

245
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:35,502
he would most likely realize that the diary for April 23rd is gone.

246
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:38,502
That's why the April 21st page

247
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,402
was placed after the April 23rd page.

248
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,802
Then, strokes were added to the number 21

249
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:45,302
to change it to 24.

250
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,402
Finally, wine was spilled onto the page, like the other page.

251
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:53,502
I see. If the April 21st page was really written there,

252
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:57,602
the page written behind it would be for April 20th.

253
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:00,502
What we thought was the diary for the 23rd that read,

254
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:03,502
"I've got no choice but to kill him"

255
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,202
was actually written on April 20th.

256
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:07,202
Yeah, in other words...

257
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:10,202
It began with "I've got no choice but to kill him" on April 20th

258
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,902
and continued on to "After talking to him,

259
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:14,402
I found him to be quite a nice boy", on the 21st.

260
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:18,302
Then comes the page about Bach and Mozart on April 22nd.

261
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:21,402
Then to the April 23rd page that was torn off

262
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,402
and finally, the last page, April 24th,

263
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:26,602
"Sonny, I'm sorry, please forgive me".

264
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:28,907
If what was written on the page of the 23rd that was removed,

265
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,202
described the feelings of regret

266
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,802
he felt for the crime he committed, it could be that,

267
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,402
first, he thought that he had no choice but to kill the boy,

268
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,202
but his intent for murder gradually waned.

269
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,802
So, the diary shows that he decided

270
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,302
to leave the boy here and flee!

271
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:45,902
But, how brilliant to think of removing the page!

272
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,102
You could've just ripped it!

273
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:50,929
If I rip it, he'd find out one day.

274
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,002
My big brother who became

275
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,933
an intermediate school student last year taught it to me!

276
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,937
When I had to write a lot of notes on a musical score for homework,

277
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,702
he told me I could cheat my way through

278
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,902
if I switch the pages with the pages of notes that I wrote before.

279
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:07,902
And? Do you have the page you ripped off?

280
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:09,602
Yep.

281
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:16,955
No good. I can't go through with it after all.

282
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,957
He, like me, is striving to become a musician.

283
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,959
The thought of sending his talent to the grave

284
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,702
deserves me none other than death.

285
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,502
I've made up my mind.

286
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:27,502
Hey! Did the man tell you where he was going?

287
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:28,502
Nope.

288
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,969
He just said that mommy would come to pick me up soon,

289
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,402
so don't let anyone into the house till then,

290
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:34,973
and left.

291
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,975
Come to think of it,

292
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,977
that picture was floating in the hot water

293
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,302
that came flowing out into the corridor.

294
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,802
The bath tub!

295
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,002
Hot water is flowing out from the space under the door.

296
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:52,991
He's probably trying to commit suicide by soaking his wrist

297
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,993
that he had cut into the tub with water.

298
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,302
If he keeps the water running, it'll prevent the blood from clotting

299
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,002
and make it easier to die from exsanguination.

300
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:01,902
That's when the picture he was holding flowed out.

301
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,502
Darn, it's locked!

302
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,302
No good. It won't budge with the strength of a child.

303
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:16,402
Besides, the width of the corridor

304
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,017
is too narrow for me to use my Super Kick Shoe.

305
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:19,902
On top of that the corridor is soaking wet

306
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:23,021
that I wouldn't be able to brace my feet either.

307
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
Okay then...

308
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,302
What're you doing, Conan?

309
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:40,702
Marking the wall like that.

310
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,402
Will you go get my shoes from the front entrance?

311
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,402
Hurry!

312
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,102
Listen. Stand back, you guys.

313
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,002
Go for it!

314
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:09,602
Awesome!

315
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,602
The floor is soaked with water!

316
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,602
He's passed out, but he's still breathing.

317
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:20,702
His wound is shallow

318
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,081
and he hasn't bled as much as expected.

319
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,083
With immediate treatment, he may still make it.

320
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,702
The hot water flowed out to the corridor

321
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:33,091
because the towel drifted to the drain and is blocking it.

322
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:39,097
Hey! Get me the slender can

323
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,802
of shaving cream by the basin!

324
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,502
Oh, okay!

325
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,902
I'll wrap his arm around with this to stop the bleeding.

326
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:53,111
Then all we have to do is get him to a hospital.

327
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:56,002
But, we children could never carry an adult out.

328
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,402
No need to worry.

329
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,502
I'll drive him over to the hospital.

330
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,121
Dr. Agasa!

331
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,202
It's amazing how you figured out we were here!

332
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:10,602
Your knapsacks were lined out by the front entrance too.

333
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,102
By the front entrance?

334
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:16,102
I put it there because I wanted you to leave as soon as possible.

335
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,502
Besides, on the way here

336
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,137
when I was driving along the mountain path,

337
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,139
I heard of what happened from this lady

338
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:25,502
that was stalled because her car ran out of gas.

339
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:31,602
-Keita? -Mommy!

340
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,151
Keita!

341
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,902
I'm glad. You're okay.

342
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,402
Yep. I'm just fine!

343
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:45,163
Thanks to Chiaki's father saving me,

344
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,902
I could do a lot of things I always wanted to do.

345
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,402
I really had a lot of fun!

346
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:54,802
Wrong, Keita.

347
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:57,802
That man didn't save you.

348
00:19:57,802 --> 00:20:01,602
No, he may have saved Keita.

349
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,602
It's been a long time since I've seen him smile like this.

350
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:15,202
Maybe the one who was confining him

351
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,195
by saying, practice...

352
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:23,201
was me, his very own mother.

353
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:50,102
And, what happened to the kidnapper after that?

354
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,002
Yeah. After he was discharged from the hospital,

355
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:54,802
it seems he went straight to the police and turned himself in.

356
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:56,502
Well, since he went as far as to

357
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:59,297
prepare the coffin that he planned to put Keita inside,

358
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:02,102
he probably doesn't have a chance to plead extenuating circumstances.

359
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:04,602
But, thanks to Keita's mother's testimony

360
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:08,202
the case was spared being publicized.

361
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,602
The kidnapper himself was the one who

362
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:14,102
called the boy's mother over by mail too.

363
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,902
But, I'm worried about the girl name Chiaki

364
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,102
that was in the picture.

365
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:23,002
Yes, because her father had become a criminal.

366
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:24,602
It seems that they're not going to tell Chiaki

367
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:27,325
about it until after she's grown up.

368
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,302
It seems that her parents

369
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:31,002
got a divorce a half a year ago too, besides.

370
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:35,602
And? Did the girl Chiaki win the contest?

371
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:38,702
Well, I haven't heard anything on that.

372
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:42,502
What? You didn't enter the contest, Chiaki?

373
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:47,345
I talked it over with mommy and decided not to enter.

374
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:51,349
I was so worried when you disappeared,

375
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:54,302
that I couldn't think about the contest at all.

376
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:55,802
Oh...

377
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:57,802
But, what a surprise that

378
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:00,002
you were playing with Daddy at the villa.

379
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:02,902
Mommy became really kind to me after that.

380
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:05,902
She stopped telling me over and over to practice!

381
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:08,102
But, when they stop telling you to practice,

382
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,402
don't you feel like playing all the more? The piano!

383
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:14,502
Yep! Let's do a four-hand performance next time!

384
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:17,375
Let's play Mozart's sonata for two pianos!

385
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,377
Okay, promise!

386
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:23,402
Parents don't understand the hearts of their children.

387
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,385
Why was he playing just that one song?

388
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:29,102
He says he heard the piece on

389
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:31,402
the video of his big brother's graduation.

390
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:34,602
Each time the Air on G String began,

391
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:38,402
graduates left the room one after the other.

392
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:42,502
So, he thought that we would leave, just like them.

393
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,403
Or...

394
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:50,502
maybe he himself wanted to graduate...

395
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:55,002
from the pressure of being a genius.

396
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,220
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,092
"Sherlock Holmes"

398
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:07,425
It's a hint that Shinichi would love.

399
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:08,608
I think so too.

400
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,720
Of course I love it.
