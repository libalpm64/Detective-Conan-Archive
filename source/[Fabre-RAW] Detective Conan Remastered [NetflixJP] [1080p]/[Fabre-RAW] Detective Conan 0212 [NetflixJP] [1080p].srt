1
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,530
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,730
The Youth Detective Squad goes mushroom hunting.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,330
Beware of evil hunters.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,830
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,830
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,330
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,990
"Mushrooms, A Bear And The Youth Detective Squad (Part 1)"

9
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,490
Listening, everyone. We are going mushroom picking.

10
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,090
However, you are not free to pick all you want.

11
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,490
Adults get to pick up to three and children up to two.

12
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,790
We'll cook the mushrooms you picked back at the inn.

13
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,690
Okay...

14
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,590
And pass the two wire fences is the hunting grounds,

15
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,390
so don't ever go inside!

16
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,090
Hunting grounds?

17
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,890
Bears appear.

18
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,890
Bears?

19
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,690
But, don't you worry. There is none on this side, so rest assured.

20
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,490
Hey, come on, what a place to go mushroom hunting.

21
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,690
I tell you.

22
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,490
At first, he made it sound like

23
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,390
there were loads of mushrooms growing everywhere.

24
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,690
There's nothing around, darn.

25
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,890
There, there.

26
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,190
It's all your fault, Genta.

27
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,590
You're the one who said let's go mushroom picking, right?

28
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,890
Actually I wanted to go apple picking.

29
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,590
But mushrooms are the thing to eat during autumn!

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,490
And besides, mushrooms are way more expensive than apples, right?

31
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,290
Oh, but an apple is the forbidden fruit, the fruit of knowledge,

32
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,390
that taught right from wrong that Adam and Eve ate,

33
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,090
and was banned from the Garden of Eden by God.

34
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,390
I think apples are way more mystical than mushrooms.

35
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,490
If it's the fruit of wisdom,

36
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,390
it'd do you good to eat a whole lot of it, Genta.

37
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,990
Shut up!

38
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,390
The Old Testament.

39
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,990
Although the saying that the fruit was an apple

40
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,590
is just popular belief.

41
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,790
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

42
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,390
What's with that look on your face?

43
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,590
What look on my face?

44
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,690
I was just looking at her.

45
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,590
You mean Ai?

46
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,990
Yes, although she's very blunt sometimes,

47
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,790
I think she's actually very sophisticated and diverse,

48
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,990
as well as very much of an adult.

49
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,790
Don't you think there's this mysterious air about her?

50
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,590
But that doesn't mean that I have special feelings for her

51
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,090
or anything like that you know.

52
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,590
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

53
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,290
Take it from me, stay away from her.

54
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,490
She's not one you can handle.

55
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,590
Hey, look.

56
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,490
It might be a mushroom!

57
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,090
Oh, that's a poisonous mushroom called agar-agar.

58
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,890
I can't take this anymore.

59
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,490
How the hell do we look for mushrooms without any hints.

60
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,990
There are hints.

61
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,390
Look around carefully.

62
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,290
See the pine needles that are yellow-green.

63
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,390
Mushrooms get their nutrition

64
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,990
by sticking onto the root of Japanese Red Pines,

65
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,090
so they are slightly weakened

66
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,490
and the needles change color like that.

67
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,490
So, that's the place to look.

68
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,090
Moreover, for mushrooms to grow,

69
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,990
good sunshine, good drainage of water and ventilation is a must.

70
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,190
If you check out the area with those things in mind.

71
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,190
See, you got what you want.

72
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,290
Where?

73
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,390
What a fine mushroom this is.

74
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,890
It sure looks delicious.

75
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,790
That's our first pick of the day.

76
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,290
Please look, everyone!

77
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,690
There are red pines with yellow-green needles over there, too.

78
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,090
Oh, really?

79
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,890
Okay, I'm going to find some, too.

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,790
Yellow-green needles. Under red pine trees.

81
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,190
I've found a mushroom, too.

82
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,690
See, me too.

83
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,790
Picking mushrooms does resemble treasure hunting in a way,

84
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,590
and is quite a lot of fun.

85
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,390
You can say that again!

86
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,390
Hey, where's Genta?

87
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,990
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him around for a while.

88
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,190
I'm sure he's off somewhere using the men's room or something.

89
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,090
Well, he was gulping down a lot of mineral water.

90
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,690
He'll be in big trouble if he gets lost in a forest like this.

91
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,490
Let's go back and check.

92
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,590
Okay...

93
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,990
Genta went past the first wired fence?

94
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,690
Really?

95
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,690
Yeah. No doubt about it.

96
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,290
The soil is still new and the spacing is narrow.

97
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,990
It's proof that a child went over the fence.

98
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,790
Besides, there a lot of red pines with yellow-green needles

99
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,490
that I mentioned on the other side of the fence, too.

100
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,490
Good gracious.

101
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,990
Genta's Youth Detective badge is under repair right now,

102
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,290
so we can't use the tracing glasses either.

103
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,990
I've no choice.

104
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,790
I'll go look for him, so you all stay here.

105
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,690
You're going off on your own again,

106
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,490
and planning to get the credit all for yourself, aren't you?

107
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,590
We'll go look for him together with you.

108
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,090
Because we're worried about him, too.

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,290
But on the other side of the fence...

110
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,390
How about this?

111
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,490
I'll go as a pair with Mitsuhiko.

112
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,490
You go with Ayumi. Let's split up and look for him.

113
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,390
In the meantime, Genta may come back here,

114
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,190
so Dr. Agasa, will you wait here?

115
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,290
Well, it's more effective than looking around for him alone, isn't it?

116
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,990
Well, I guess so.

117
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,190
But, be careful, Ai. Two fences down is the hunting area.

118
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,290
It's not unusual that people picking mountain vegetables

119
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,190
are mistaken for animals and shot by hunters, in Japan.

120
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,590
Oh, thank you. So, you're worried about me.

121
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,790
You...

122
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,890
Anyway, let's all meet here in an hour.

123
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,290
If we can't find him,

124
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,690
let's have the people at the inn help us search for him.

125
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,890
Let's get started.

126
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,990
Okay...

127
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,490
Hey, let's get to it!

128
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,890
Let's go!

129
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,390
Okay!

130
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,990
Hey, Genta!

131
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,390
Genta, where are you? Answer me!

132
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,390
Darn.

133
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,590
I wonder where on earth Genta is?

134
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,690
-Genta! -Genta, where are you?

135
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,390
May I ask you a question?

136
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,090
Is there something between Conan and you?

137
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,690
Something?

138
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,590
Well, you two are always sneaking off

139
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,690
and talking in an adult Iike manner with each other.

140
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,990
You seem to understand each other really well.

141
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,390
You both have sort of a world of your own.

142
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,090
Don't let it bother you,

143
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,490
because it's not something all that romantic.

144
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,090
-But... -Come on, let's go.

145
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,990
Wait.

146
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,790
What was that sound?

147
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,090
It came from beyond the two wired fences, didn't it?

148
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,590
The wired fence is torn apart.

149
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,390
He could've gone in beyond from here.

150
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,790
It can't be. The hunting ground is beyond here.

151
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,690
If he got beyond the first fence,

152
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,590
and got lost in the forest in between,

153
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,190
he wouldn't be able to tell whether the hunting ground is

154
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,190
beyond these red pine bushes, would he?

155
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,990
Wait for me.

156
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,090
Genta? Come on. You worried us out of our wits.

157
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,490
Bear...

158
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,790
No sweat.

159
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,690
It's still a cub.

160
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,090
It doesn't even seem to be a year old yet.

161
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,490
How cute.

162
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,890
I guess so.

163
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,190
But, we've got to be careful,

164
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,290
because I'm sure the mother bear is somewhere nearby.

165
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,590
What?

166
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,890
Sound of gunfire?

167
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,190
Don't tell me that the mother of this cub was shot by a hunter.

168
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,790
Oh, no! Don't run that way.

169
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,390
There. It's a hunter.

170
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,490
I hope he doesn't think that we're prey.

171
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,690
Hey! We're people!

172
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,990
This is...

173
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,090
This wound...

174
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,790
is a rifle wound?

175
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,790
It can't be.

176
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,690
Hey! Don't shoot, please!

177
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,290
We're people.

178
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,990
Don't you see? That hunter is after us.

179
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,590
He thinks that we've witnessed a murder and he wants to shut us up.

180
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,890
What?

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,080
Genta, that's enough!

182
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Do you have any idea of how worried we were about you?

183
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,780
I'm really sorry.

184
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,080
I was trying to pick mushrooms for everybody,

185
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,180
and before I knew it I went on in beyond.

186
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,480
Of all things!

187
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,380
Well, well, either way, you came back safely.

188
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,980
And, did you contact Ai and Mitsuhiko?

189
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,380
Well, I've been trying to contact them for a while now.

190
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,080
But I'm not getting any response.

191
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,680
Seriously, now it's those guys.

192
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,780
Hey, hey. The response from Mitsuhiko's badge

193
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,580
seems to be coming from the hunting area here.

194
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
What?

195
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,980
Strange.

196
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,080
After all, they should know that they are not supposed to go inside.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,480
Seriously.

198
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's find them while it's still bright

199
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,180
and go back to the inn before it gets dark!

200
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,380
Okay...

201
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,680
Hey, hey, I can't make up here.

202
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,880
Talk about helplessness.

203
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,180
What's the matter?

204
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,880
"Kiyoshi Yasaka (41)" -Coming to a place with children?

205
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,380
Two children seem to have got lost in here,

206
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,080
so we're looking for them.

207
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Did you see a boy and girl somewhere around here, mister?

208
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,580
No, I didn't see any of them.

209
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,680
Hey! Here's Mitsuhiko's Youth Detective Squad badge!

210
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,380
Really?

211
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,980
But the two are nowhere in sight.

212
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,580
Blood stains.

213
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,180
Hey! What are these big footprints?

214
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,880
It's the footprints of a bear.

215
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,280
What? Which means that they were both eaten by a bear?

216
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,980
I don't think so.

217
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,480
Bears are basically afraid of humans,

218
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,780
and besides they don't take humans to be beasts of prey.

219
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,780
But, that's true when it comes to that certain bear.

220
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,680
"Matasaburou Saika (67)" -If it's the one

221
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,780
who has a grudge against humans,

222
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,180
the two kids would be

223
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,680
a feast for the bear before it goes into hibernation.

224
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,880
Yes, if it's that one-eyed Japanese bear, Jubei.

225
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,880
Oh, no.

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,780
I see. So the rumor about the bear was true after all.

227
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,580
My having come all this way was worth it.

228
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,980
Don't worry, girlie,

229
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,880
"Tomoya Negoro (28)" -I'll avenge the death of your friends for you.

230
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,180
What do you mean avenge the death of?

231
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,680
We don't even know whether they were attacked by the bear yet.

232
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,580
At any rate, let us help you look for the children.

233
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,880
Yeah. After all, we know this mountain better than you do.

234
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,580
Sorry, girlie.

235
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,980
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

236
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,180
Ai!

237
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,180
It's Conan and the others.

238
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,180
See. On the other side of the forest.

239
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,580
Hey!

240
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,680
Wait. The hunter we saw a while ago is with them, too.

241
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,980
What? But, why?

242
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Probably to block our path of escape,

243
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,280
since we witnessed him committing the murder.

244
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,680
If we go out carelessly, we'll be shot to death.

245
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,180
And, he'll probably justify by saying that he thought we were the bear.

246
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,380
Hey, Ai!

247
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,180
Where are you, Mitsuhiko?

248
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,780
Answer us if you're around somewhere!

249
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,880
Another piece of potato chip on the ground.

250
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,980
It's not stale yet, and I'm sure the two left it behind as a trail.

251
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,980
They're trying to show us the road they took.

252
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,780
Hey! Shouldn't we look for Ai's badge using Conan s glasses?

253
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,080
Can't do, because her badge is on my desk at home.

254
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,080
I was testing whether the transmission function of your badge

255
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,780
that is under repair is working well, so...

256
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,480
Oh, no.

257
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,880
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

258
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Can you verbally describe the place

259
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,680
where I found Mitsuhiko's badge a while ago, can't you?

260
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,180
Yeah, because it was near the place the wired fence was torn apart.

261
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,680
Then, tell the person at the inn where it is,

262
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,580
and have the police check that area together with them.

263
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,680
What? The police?

264
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,480
Don't you think it's strange that a trail of their path is left behind,

265
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,580
and yet we can't catch up with them no matter how hard we try?

266
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,980
Aren't they running from the bear?

267
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,980
No, there were blood stains around the area

268
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,880
where Mitsuhiko's badge was found.

269
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,980
There was a brand new bullet mark on a tree nearby, too.

270
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,880
Maybe it's not the bear that the two are running from, but rather...

271
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,780
Hey, don't tell me that...

272
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Could it be Mitsuhiko and Ai?

273
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Hey, what's with you?

274
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Darn, it got away.

275
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,680
A rabbit?

276
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Are you guys out of your mind?

277
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,380
What if it were the two kids?

278
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,880
I've got eyes good enough to distinguish prey from the kids.

279
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,580
Don't you worry even if that bear Jubei comes out.

280
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,280
I'll get him with the swiftness you just saw.

281
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,580
That flimsy shot of yours wouldn't even skim by it.

282
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,780
What?

283
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,980
If you treasure your life, don't shoot even if Jubei appears.

284
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,780
The minute it senses the smell of humans,

285
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,280
it'll sneak soundlessly up to you.

286
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
A bullet shot will not kill him.

287
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,780
It is a monster of over 2 meters.

288
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,780
I'm the only one who can hunt it down.

289
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,080
Because I'm the one who got one of its eyes 20 years ago.

290
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,780
What's with that old man, anyway?

291
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,480
He's a well-known hunter in this area.

292
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,180
I hear that he used to be a hunter

293
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,180
in the mountains of the Tohoku region in the past.

294
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,180
But, since he ran into Jubei here, he's decided to stick around it seems.

295
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,180
He was a hunter?

296
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,480
Yeah, the boss of a group of hunters.

297
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,180
I guess we don't have to worry about when the bear shows up then.

298
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,580
Dr. Agasa, will you make the call?

299
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,980
All right.

300
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,380
Just as I thought.

301
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,980
That hunter was going to fire at us

302
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,680
the minute we showed up in front of him.

303
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,980
What?

304
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,580
But what if we shout out loud and wait in the middle of the road?

305
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,680
They've got little Ayumi on their side you know.

306
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,780
He may be thinking of taking her hostage and killing everybody off.

307
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,880
After all, he's already murdered someone.

308
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,680
Oh, no.

309
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,380
Judging from how he looked when he fired at us,

310
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,280
it seems that he came into the mountains with a hunter

311
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,080
that he had a grudge against and shot him to death.

312
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,980
But, don't you have to submit papers before you're allowed to hunt?

313
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,080
If the corpse is found, wouldn't he be the prime suspect,

314
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,580
being that he came in together with the one he killed?

315
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,380
Not really. You can submit the papers way before you come.

316
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,280
Then, you're allowed to come and hunt anytime

317
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,880
between the duration of the permit.

318
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,080
You don't need to report when you're coming.

319
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,980
In other words, if you make the person that you're planning to kill

320
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,080
submit the papers,

321
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,380
and you go on and make yourself a fake alibi,

322
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,580
even if the corpse is found, chances are,

323
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,380
the officers will think that some hunter had mistakenly fired at him.

324
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,980
Which means that since we saw what happened...

325
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,880
Yes, his plan went down the drain.

326
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,980
He's probably dying to kill us.

327
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,480
Then maybe we shouldn't have made a trail with potato chips,

328
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
to let them know where we are,

329
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,680
but rather escape through the woods.

330
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
No.

331
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,380
Moving on our own in a forest we are not familiar with is dangerous.

332
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,180
We have no way of getting out of these mountains

333
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,780
without joining Dr. Agasa anyway.

334
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,180
We'll be fine.

335
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,880
If you dropped your badge near the corpse,

336
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,780
I'm sure that Conan will notice something is wrong.

337
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,480
Yes, I'm sure he will.

338
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,480
Come on, we've got to think while walking

339
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
if we want to save ourselves.

340
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,980
We've got to figure out a way

341
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,180
to let Conan alone know the predicament we're in.

342
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,480
Not only for ourselves do we have to be careful,

343
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,580
but also for this bear cub that for some reason is coming along with us.

344
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,780
We don't want to endanger it, do we?

345
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,180
No.

346
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,180
I'll bet a bear did this.

347
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,080
The bear peeled off the outer wood with its nails

348
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,880
and ate the sweet wood on the inside.

349
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,280
The space between the nails is wide and it's pretty high, too.

350
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,780
It's a pretty big one.

351
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,180
-It's Jubei. -What?

352
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,480
Look, it's bitten the tree

353
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,180
together with the cub that it gave birth to this winter.

354
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,980
Birth to? Isn't Jubei a male?

355
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
You mean you don't know?

356
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,380
It has been said since the days of old

357
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,980
that the god who resides in the mountains is a jealous goddess.

358
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,980
In order to complete hunting safely,

359
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,380
it is necessary to avoid the envy of mountain goddess,

360
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,680
that's why the bear has a male's name.

361
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,980
She was named after the superb, one-eyed swordsman, Yagyu Jubei.

362
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,980
You mean it's a female bear that is over 2 meters in height?

363
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,680
I sure gotta get a look at this one.

364
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
All do anything to get to see it.

365
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Is there anything on my face, mister?

366
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,180
Oh, no.

367
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,380
It's just that you talk so much like one of my friends that I...

368
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,280
Is that friend of yours here in the mountains today, by any chance?

369
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,380
What?

370
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,880
Because when you took your camera out a while ago I saw a shotgun.

371
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,280
The bullet of that gun splits into

372
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,180
9 directions and flies, doesn't it?

373
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,380
But the one you fired a while ago was a one-direction gun.

374
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,580
I've heard that there is no hunter that carries

375
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
two types of bullets when hunting.

376
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,680
Well...

377
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,580
My friend forgot to take his extra bullet

378
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,380
and went into the mountains without it.

379
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,980
I thought I'd give it to him if I ran into him,

380
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,680
and brought it along with me.

381
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,580
But, will he be okay?

382
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,580
Your friend's still in there alone, isn't he?

383
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,280
He'll be fine.

384
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,780
He's been here many times,

385
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,980
and we always hunt apart from each other anyway.

386
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,680
Do you sense something, Ayumi?

387
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,280
No. It's nothing.

388
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Hey, they're starting off.

389
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,380
Yeah.

390
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,280
Hey, Ayumi!

391
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,880
Wait for me.

392
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,900
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,000
"Mushrooms"

394
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,120
Hey, how come you're the expensive mushroom and I'm the cheap one.

395
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,320
That's life.
