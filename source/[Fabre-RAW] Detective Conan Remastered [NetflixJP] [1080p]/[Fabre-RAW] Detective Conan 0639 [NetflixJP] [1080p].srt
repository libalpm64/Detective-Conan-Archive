1
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:05,714
The person we saved from a rampaging car

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,714
was Kaede Nakakita, adopted child of a rich man

3
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:11,214
called Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose.

4
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:12,714
In response to her invitation,

5
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,014
we visited Mr. Ouzaburo's Mansion

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,714
that bear the name "Red Leaf Palace"

7
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:19,999
and were surprised by the numerous trick art employed here and there.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,014
Mr. Ouzaburo's two children,

9
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,005
"Ogito Katayose (35), eldest son" -son Ogito...

10
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:26,914
"Nobue Katayose (32), eldest daughter" -and daughter Nobue,

11
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:28,714
had been feuding with each other.

12
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:30,614
Mr. Ouzaburo had become saddened...

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,814
"Ouzaburo Katayose (68)" -by the two children.

14
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:38,017
That Mr. Ouzaburo died by poison.

15
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,614
But neither I nor Ran witnessed

16
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:42,814
any suspects fleeing the scene.

17
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:46,014
Was this a sealed room murder?

18
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:47,414
Amidst the escalating alternation

19
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,029
between Ogito and Nobue over the inheritance...

20
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,414
"Eiko Suzaka (48), chauffer" -Ouzaburo's letter...

21
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:56,035
consigned to the chauffeur, Eiko Suzaka, was discovered.

22
00:00:57,614 --> 00:01:00,039
Now, close the umbrella.

23
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:03,114
Gaze at the evening sun setting in the east.

24
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:06,514
Look at the two rods holding up the red leaves.

25
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:09,014
Search for a longer rod.

26
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:12,514
My dream of the red leaves shall lie dormant there.

27
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:16,055
Like the fog clears.

28
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:18,314
Let's see through love and crime as well.

29
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,514
A sealed room, a code, the real culprit...

30
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,514
Push through the red leaves and solve the mysteries.

31
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,063
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,067
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:15,106
"Solving Mysteries at the Red Maple Palace (Part 2)"

35
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,706
Putting the puzzle-solving aside,

36
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:20,179
we've got to protect Kaede.

37
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,206
We don't even know the culprit behind that car.

38
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,183
About that, I have a rough idea.

39
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,706
Ogito did that to Kaede?

40
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,191
See, when he heard Kaede almost

41
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,006
got into an accident with a freak car...

42
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,195
Accident?

43
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,006
But it's because you were walking carelessly.

44
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:41,506
Even though the chauffer Eiko was with her,

45
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,706
isn't it odd that he'd assume she was walking

46
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,306
instead of riding in a car?

47
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:49,506
Then could the culprit behind Mr. Ouzaburo's murder also be...

48
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:52,211
-Pardon me. -Yes?

49
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:58,606
Since it seems it will take quite a while before meal time, feel free.

50
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:02,221
"Kaede Nakakita (8), adopted child of Katayose"

51
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:07,106
Smells good.

52
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,227
Black tea, right?

53
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,229
I'll go fetch Grandpa.

54
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,906
Grandpa.

55
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:20,706
Kaede.

56
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:28,606
Was Ouzaburo well aware of his condition?

57
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:31,406
It did seem he was prepared for it?

58
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:35,106
Occasionally, he would mutter, "I can't die just yet."

59
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:37,206
What does it mean?

60
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:38,706
It means that, once he passed away,

61
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:42,261
Kaede may find herself in much more danger.

62
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,265
Grandpa...

63
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:50,269
He promised to drink black tea with me forever, but...

64
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:55,406
Is it true that Ouzaburo never put sugar in his tea?

65
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:58,006
Never. Strange, right?

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,806
Well, all of us have our own preferences.

67
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:04,006
But everyone else puts sugar inside.

68
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,006
I put five spoonfuls.

69
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,306
That's too much.

70
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,806
Our spoons are small!

71
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:16,906
I see. So that's what it was.

72
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:17,906
What?

73
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:21,006
Ogito Katayose and Nobue Katayose vanished from sight?

74
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:23,806
What were the guarding officers doing?

75
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,906
Yes. But, you see...

76
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:28,806
This mansion is virtually a maze.

77
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:32,106
Don't tell me they've fled into the mountains.

78
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:34,313
There's no escape route in the mountains.

79
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,006
Take a look.

80
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,806
This place is fenced off along the boundary line.

81
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,106
They say an electric current is running through it.

82
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,806
Most likely for the purpose of preventing

83
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:46,106
an invasion by large wild animals like boars.

84
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:48,806
It's probably just as dangerous for humans, too.

85
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,331
No. Normally only weak current is engaged.

86
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,006
But when something does make contact with the fence,

87
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,906
an alarm sounds from that shed.

88
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,306
I was informed that the alarm and the voltage adjustment

89
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,906
can be controlled from there.

90
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:08,347
Over there.

91
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:11,806
That's the east end of our premises.

92
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,106
Something's glowing.

93
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:15,306
That?

94
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,006
A mirror was erected on top.

95
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,357
Weird, right?

96
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,906
A mirror?

97
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:22,706
Help me!

98
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:31,506
Hey! Did you hear a woman screaming?

99
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,906
Aunt Nobue!

100
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:36,006
-Over there! -Darn it! Let's hurry!

101
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:38,377
Darn it! Another victim?

102
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,389
Aunt Nobue...

103
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,806
Kaede, it's best you don't look.

104
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,606
We're too late.

105
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:02,006
Seems the murder weapon was the arrow on her back.

106
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,403
Huh? There's one more arrow.

107
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,206
What's the matter?

108
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:10,106
Eiko, Aunt Nobue is...

109
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,706
I knew it.

110
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:16,106
Detective Mouri!

111
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,806
Inspector.

112
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:20,106
So it's Nobue this time.

113
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,421
The wound doesn't seem like a deep one.

114
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:25,006
So there may be poison on it.

115
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:27,006
It's not an ordinary arrow.

116
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:29,106
This is a bolt from crossbow.

117
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:31,006
Crossbow?

118
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:33,206
Do you know something about it?

119
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,506
Yes. Well...

120
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:38,206
It's one of Ogito's hobbies.

121
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:40,439
But amidst the grove of trees,

122
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,506
where could this have been shot from?

123
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,706
If the shooter had approached her,

124
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,106
she would've taken notice and escaped into the woods.

125
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:49,106
If shot from a distance,

126
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:51,706
the trees would in turn interfere with the line of sight.

127
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,453
You can get a good view from there, right?

128
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,606
My tree house!

129
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:06,006
So, the culprit shot the bolt from up there?

130
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,506
All right!

131
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:10,106
-Be careful! -Idiot!

132
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,471
Don't you look down on my athletic skill!

133
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,006
Dad!

134
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:18,006
Why?

135
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,485
Gotcha!

136
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,706
No mistake about it.

137
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,106
The owner is no doubt Ogito!

138
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,906
He climbed up to this terrace and shot Nobue.

139
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:38,106
Without using the rope ladder, how did he climb up there?

140
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,906
He must have notched the ladder

141
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:42,306
after putting down his crossbow.

142
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:45,806
There was no crossbow there when you climbed up earlier, right?

143
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:46,906
No.

144
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:49,406
Kaede climbed up the tree trunk earlier,

145
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:52,511
and the notch was already there!

146
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,006
What now?

147
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:56,006
In that case,

148
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:59,006
I bet Ogito also climbed up the tree.

149
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:03,006
But isn't it odd to leave the murder weapon crossbow there?

150
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,106
Who knows?

151
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:07,106
That Ogito guy must just be really forgetful!

152
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:10,806
Yes.

153
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:14,206
Is that so? Thank you.

154
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:17,306
Inspector, according to the forensic results,

155
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,306
among the two bolts, the one piercing the victim

156
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,206
tested positive for poison from aconitine derivatives,

157
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:26,545
but the other tested negative.

158
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,506
It was cyanide in Ouzaburo's case,

159
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:31,906
and aconitine this time?

160
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,106
One more thing.

161
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,806
On Nobue's left sleeve,

162
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:39,206
they've found a tear as if it was cut by something.

163
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,106
I'm certain that things went like this:

164
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,506
The first bolt that Ogito shot from this tree house

165
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:48,306
tore through Nobue's clothes.

166
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:50,569
Soon after Nobue noticed she was being targeted,

167
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
she let out a "Help me" scream

168
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,306
and fled into the woods.

169
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:57,206
However, the second bolt with poison hit her,

170
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:59,906
and resulted in her death.

171
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,706
Why wasn't the first bolt laced with poison, though?

172
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:06,106
That... that's because...

173
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,106
There was only enough poison for one bolt!

174
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,406
What's this?

175
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,906
Somebody must have come into contact with the fence

176
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,006
and set off the alarm!

177
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,206
By fence, you mean the one with the electric current?

178
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:22,406
Yes.

179
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,603
Don't tell me it's Ogito?

180
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:29,606
What's the matter?

181
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,611
Inspector! Our missing suspect, Ogito Katayose

182
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,206
was found to have fallen off a cliff!

183
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:37,106
What? What'd you say?

184
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:46,625
Where is Ogito Katayose?

185
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,973
Sir! In the mountain stream below us!

186
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:52,631
So, he fell from here?

187
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:58,973
It was a full-on jolt?

188
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:03,073
I see! That must mean the culprit isn't Ogito!

189
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,073
What? Why that?

190
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,073
Every occupant of this domicile knows

191
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:10,173
that the fence here is electric fired.

192
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,473
I don't believe they would touch the fence by mistake.

193
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,655
In other words, someone pushed him off?

194
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
Hey, look at that!

195
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:23,073
What's that mounted on top of the pole?

196
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,663
Looks like a mirror.

197
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,273
It's true, but that mirror...

198
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:30,373
Where is it facing?

199
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,973
I've got it!

200
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,073
As long as it doesn't rain,

201
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:36,675
the mirror will directly reflect the setting sun!

202
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,073
So that's why it tells us to "Close the umbrella"!

203
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,573
With that said, the remaining puzzle is...

204
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:46,973
Which is longer, the horizontal or the vertical one?

205
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:51,373
The vertical pole looks longer to me.

206
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:54,173
Looks like we need to investigate the inside of the poles.

207
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,973
-Roger. -Inspector!

208
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:57,173
Officers who descended into the valley

209
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,373
have confirmed Ogito Katayose's death.

210
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:03,473
We shall commence the transport of his body immediately.

211
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,073
Inspector! All the mysteries have thawed out!

212
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,473
What?

213
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,709
The culprit responsible for the murders

214
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,773
of Mr. Ouzaburo, Nobue and Ogito...

215
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:14,713
is you!

216
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:17,673
Miss Eiko Suzaka!

217
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,173
What?

218
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,273
No... no way.

219
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,721
I didn't do anything.

220
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:28,173
Presumably, Mr. Ouzaburo had already prepared a will ante mortem.

221
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:31,373
On the occasion of both Ogito's and Nobue's deaths,

222
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,273
you would become the beneficiary of his inheritance

223
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:37,173
or something along those lines, right?

224
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,737
Dazzled by the inheritance,

225
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,173
you killed them one by one!

226
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,473
Enough of the silliness already!

227
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:44,743
No, that must be it!

228
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:48,747
Inspector! Hurry up and investigate!

229
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:49,873
Before I do,

230
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:53,973
are you saying you can elucidate the sealed room mystery?

231
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,755
Nah, I mean that...

232
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,773
Well, sooner or later, I'll figure it out.

233
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:03,673
That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?

234
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,973
Pops, leave the rest to me!

235
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,473
Detective Mouri?

236
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,173
Though the colorful something smells good...

237
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:14,473
It will scatter eventually...

238
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,073
Detective Mouri?

239
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,779
My apologies, pardon me.

240
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,173
Now, allow me to explain in a more responsible manner.

241
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,785
Let's start from the sealed room mystery.

242
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,787
Ran was in a position where she could monitor

243
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,073
who was coming and going from Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose's annex.

244
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:34,273
Beyond that, Conan and Kaede were also in a position

245
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,473
where the annex was in plain sight.

246
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:39,773
The scene resembled a sealed room with iron walls

247
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,173
under the surveillance of those three.

248
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:46,073
Moreover, there isn't any secret underground tunnel, right?

249
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:48,807
Of course not.

250
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,809
In that case, there is only one answer.

251
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:53,173
It would have been impossible

252
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:55,573
for any perpetrator to depart the scene.

253
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,573
What are you saying?

254
00:13:57,573 --> 00:14:01,873
There wasn't anyone else at the scene apart from the victim!

255
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:05,173
I'm saying that's the true answer!

256
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:06,573
What now?

257
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,827
Then, Mr. Ouzaburo...

258
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,173
Committed suicide?

259
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,373
What in the world do you think you're saying?

260
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,673
The black tea also belonging to the guest was inside that room!

261
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,573
The cup was steaming, too.

262
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,839
That black was a work of disguise from Mr. Ouzaburo.

263
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,873
In order to make it seem as if a guest had been invited.

264
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,173
How can you be so sure of that?

265
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,847
-There was no spoon. -What?

266
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,973
Mr. Ouzaburo, lacking the habit of adding sugar,

267
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:35,773
had no need for spoons even for mixing milk.

268
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,773
That's why he carelessly neglected

269
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,573
to prepare a spoon for the "guest".

270
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:41,673
To think he went as far as to prepare a sugar pot,

271
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,573
I can only say it was a gross oversight on his part.

272
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:46,273
No way!

273
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:49,273
The reason for suicide was inheritance trouble.

274
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,273
Ogito and Nobue both

275
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:55,273
seemed to be in extremely tight spots, financially.

276
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:57,873
But that's precisely why Master was worried

277
00:14:57,873 --> 00:15:00,879
and thought he couldn't die just yet.

278
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,881
So, why did he kill himself?

279
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:06,885
Remind me again of the reason why he "couldn't die just yet"?

280
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,273
He thought that if he died,

281
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:12,673
the two of them would endanger Kaede's life.

282
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,673
But unfortunately,

283
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:18,897
Mr. Ouzaburo took the fact that he won't last long to heart.

284
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:20,373
"In that case,

285
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,473
I shall expunge the two from Kaede once and for all."

286
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:26,173
What might happen if we assume that?

287
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:29,273
I see. That's why he committed suicide

288
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:30,909
and disguised it as a murder by poison.

289
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:33,873
But even so, why would he go as far as to invite Detective Mouri

290
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:35,773
if he planned to commit suicide?

291
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:38,273
No, on the contrary...

292
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:40,919
Mr. Ouzaburo is fond of tricks.

293
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,273
He likely intended to challenge me to the mysteries.

294
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:45,973
I see.

295
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,573
Then, what about Nobue?

296
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,573
What we saw earlier was supposed to be Nobue's acting.

297
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:54,273
Acting?

298
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,273
She tore her own clothes with one of Ogito's arrow

299
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:59,273
that she obtained somewhere, and let out a scream.

300
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:02,941
By doing so, she made it appear as if Ogito was attacking her.

301
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:07,773
But Nobue was shot in the back with an arrow and killed.

302
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,473
According to Nobue's plan,

303
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:11,273
she was supposed to feign unconsciousness

304
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:14,073
and wait for our arrival.

305
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,573
However, Ogito showed up before we did.

306
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:18,573
What?

307
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:22,173
Then, don't tell me he saw Nobue faking unconsciousness.

308
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,673
Exactly.

309
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:26,573
And he stabbed her with the poisonous bolt.

310
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:27,973
Please hold on.

311
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,969
Why would he conveniently be carrying a poisonous arrow?

312
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,973
I think he prepared one beforehand.

313
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,273
-What? -Mr. Ogito told me that

314
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:36,975
when he went boar hunting,

315
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:41,473
he would apply poison derived from wild plants to his arrow.

316
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:42,981
I see.

317
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,473
Nobue orchestrated an attempted murder

318
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:48,273
all for the purpose of framing Ogito.

319
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,989
Upon doing so, she would be able to gain all of the inheritance.

320
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:53,573
However, Ogito took advantage of it,

321
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,487
and killed her instead, right?

322
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:59,606
In that case, the one who put the crossbow by the tree house was...

323
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:00,999
It's Nobue.

324
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:03,806
After presumably tossing it up there from below.

325
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,706
Since she didn't use the rope ladder,

326
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:08,106
she didn't notice the notch in it.

327
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:12,006
In short, the one who made the notch was Ogito.

328
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:15,006
Then, Ogito was following Nobue?

329
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:17,306
In order to kill her when the opportunity arose?

330
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:19,706
No. If that were the case,

331
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,506
he would've carried the bow as well instead of just the bolt.

332
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,606
Ogito brought only the bolt with him upon leaving the mansion.

333
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:29,027
I gather that he already solved the code long before us.

334
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:32,206
The bolt was probably for probing the inside of the pole,

335
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:35,806
which is likely where the hidden fortune is located.

336
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,306
I see.

337
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:42,406
But, can you prove that he indeed stabbed Nobue on the spot?

338
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:44,406
Good question.

339
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,506
I believe Eiko could have.

340
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:49,306
What?

341
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,606
You had a slip of the tongue, right?

342
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:53,051
After hearing about Nobue's death,

343
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,706
you uttered "I knew it".

344
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,055
What did you mean by that?

345
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,506
That's...

346
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:02,606
You were suspecting Ogito at first.

347
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:04,406
That he was aiming for Kaede's life,

348
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:07,506
and finally poisoned Mr. Ouzaburo to death today.

349
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,067
With that thought in mind,

350
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,806
you kept a watchful eye on his actions, didn't you?

351
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:14,006
No, I would never.

352
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,606
It follows that

353
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,706
you also saw the scene in which Ogito stabbed Nobue.

354
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:21,079
Since you couldn't ascertain the situation from a distant view,

355
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,406
as soon as Nobue's death was confirmed,

356
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,506
you uttered "I knew it".

357
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:29,106
After finishing off Nobue, Ogito came here

358
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,606
and climbed up the fence to check the poles,

359
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,706
and fell to his death due to electric shock.

360
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:36,606
I doubt that's the case.

361
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:40,206
Eiko. When the alarm sounded,

362
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:43,506
you said, "Somebody must have touched the fence".

363
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,506
Why "somebody"?

364
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,606
Why not "something" like animals?

365
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,506
Monitoring Ogito's every move,

366
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,606
you witnessed him coming out of the shed

367
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:58,006
where the controls for the electrified fence and alarm were.

368
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,106
You entered the shed after Ogito's departure,

369
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,121
and found the electric current and alarm cut off.

370
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:07,125
Perhaps you already knew the meaning

371
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,706
behind the cipher from the very beginning?

372
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:13,131
If Mr. Ouzaburo were to hide something inside the pole,

373
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,606
he would have required someone else's help.

374
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,806
Then, realizing Ogito must've also figured out the code

375
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,806
by turning off the current,

376
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:25,143
you turned the electric current back on.

377
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,906
Not only that, you also made the current stronger than normal.

378
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,806
What'd you say?

379
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,151
Ogito, operating under a false sense of security

380
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,153
that the current was turned off...

381
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:39,157
He climbed up the fence in order to search the pole.

382
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:46,406
I'm truly sorry!

383
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,167
I confess that I did it!

384
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,606
I mistook him for the murderer who poisoned Master.

385
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,173
I'm truly sorry!

386
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:13,206
What are you doing, Inspector?

387
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:16,006
They're searching for the treasure!

388
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,606
Hold on a minute!

389
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:20,606
The code instructed us to "search for the longer rod!"

390
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,806
That's why we've been searching like this.

391
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,706
But as far as I can see, the vertical one looks longer.

392
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,206
But it's the horizontal pole that's longer,

393
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,106
they've already measured it.

394
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,406
I think it's called "Fick illusion".

395
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:37,806
One of Mr. Katayose's deceptions, which is his hobby.

396
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,606
If you place two lines equal in length in a "T" shape,

397
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:44,006
you'll think the vertical one looks longer.

398
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:48,006
They say it's an illusion discovered in 1851.

399
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,106
The poles are based on that illusion,

400
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:53,231
so the horizontal one is deliberately a bit longer.

401
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:56,506
Inspector, found it! The treasure!

402
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,506
We police officers shouldn't call it a treasure.

403
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,606
According to Mr. Katayose, it's his personal dream.

404
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:06,506
This is...

405
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,906
a ruby, isn't it?

406
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,706
A treasure indeed!

407
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:12,806
There's a letter that goes with it.

408
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:15,806
It's signed by Mr. Katayose.

409
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:17,906
"Eiko Suzaka.

410
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:20,406
By the time you have read this letter,

411
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,006
I believe I will have already ceased to exist.

412
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,906
To you who have done so much for me,

413
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,906
please hear out my one last request.

414
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:30,806
I would like for you to take care of Kaede after my death,

415
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,106
who shall be the beneficiary of my inheritance,

416
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:34,006
until her adulthood.

417
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,273
Please accept the enclosed ruby

418
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:38,506
with this letter as my gratitude.

419
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,006
As for the reason I fixated on that little girl so much...

420
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,206
Instead of laughing at the unbecomingness of an old man,

421
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:49,006
please surmise looking at the enclosed picture."

422
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,906
These two people...

423
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,506
Their names are written on it.

424
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:56,306
Ouzaburo Katayose.

425
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:59,006
Momiji Nakakita.

426
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:02,106
And everyone was immediately convinced.

427
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:04,906
The reason it was called the "Red Leaf Palace".

428
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,706
Although they couldn't get married due to various circumstances,

429
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:12,706
but Mr. Katayose had never forgotten Momiji, till the end.

430
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:37,006
Kaede went back to Hokkaido.

431
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:38,906
Without knowing what happened,

432
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:42,306
she enthusiastically vowed to invite Eiko over for a visit someday.

433
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,306
A postcard?

434
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:48,706
Hey! Conan, how's it?

435
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:51,806
Today, Kaede Nakakita is as energetic as always.

436
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,706
Conan, come visit me some time.

437
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:57,106
I shall make you my hubby!

438
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:59,006
Your hubby...

439
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,606
You wish...

440
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,298
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:05,880
"Water zither cave (Suikinkutsu)"

442
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,360
The next story is the Okayama and Kurashiki Mystery Tour.

443
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,416
Even those of you who couldn't go,

444
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,680
can still enjoy a real deduction experience.
