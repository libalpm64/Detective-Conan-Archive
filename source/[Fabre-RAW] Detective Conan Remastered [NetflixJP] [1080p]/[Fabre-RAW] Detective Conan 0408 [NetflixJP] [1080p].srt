1
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:06,849
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,449
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,449
Today's story is the finale of the magic case.

4
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,849
Solve the miraculous trick with Conan and Heiji!

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,349
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,149
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,449
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,719
Due to popular magician Dogo Hoshikawa's show,

9
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,419
we got invited to the legendary magician, Mr. Masakage's house.

10
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:09,419
It has been exactly 10 years since the day,

11
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,419
Mr. Masakage suddenly disappeared.

12
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,719
The pupils magicians have gotten together there

13
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,219
and Tenko Himemiya among them

14
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,519
was discovered dead in the hallway on the 2nd floor!

15
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,719
More than 30 minutes have passed since she died.

16
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,119
Did you find her yourselves?

17
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:32,619
No, Hoshikwa was also here with us.

18
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,319
What the heck is this?

19
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,419
Tell me, what is this room?

20
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,019
Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

21
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,019
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

22
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,619
I found it!

23
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,319
So, this is the Christmas tree magic, huh?

24
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,019
What's more, the tree is where

25
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,019
Ms. Tenko's body was found at the end of the hallway.

26
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,919
She must be hiding something.

27
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,019
Oh!

28
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,619
Look at this, Kudo. This picture.

29
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:03,319
The pictures of the 3 pupils when they were young.

30
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,619
This might be...

31
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,519
That's right, the shadow!

32
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,919
That's right, the shadow of the vase is wrong!

33
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,919
The shadow of the vase?

34
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,519
The moonlight was shining on the vase from behind,

35
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,919
so we couldn't see the patterns on it.

36
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,619
But after the blackout, when we found Tenko's dead body,

37
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,719
the moonlight was shining on the vase from the side,

38
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,019
so we could see the patterns!

39
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,219
There's no way the moon moves that fast!

40
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,019
The shadow of the vase.

41
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:41,019
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Solution)"

42
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,419
The moonlight.

43
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,319
-The vase. -What's happening?

44
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,119
That's not possible, that doesn't.

45
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:51,019
First the moon was covered by clouds,

46
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,719
so it was dark and the design of the vase couldn't be seen.

47
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,419
The cloud disappeared during the blackout

48
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,319
and so the design could now be seen?

49
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,719
If you say so.

50
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,219
It may be so.

51
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,919
And then?

52
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,819
Didn't you hear the culprit run away or voices during the blackout?

53
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,119
It may have been so,

54
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,819
but the lights suddenly turned off and we were screaming so...

55
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:20,219
Mr. Hoshikawa was telling us in a soothing voice to calm down.

56
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,619
Soothing voice?

57
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:23,819
It's all right!

58
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,719
He repeated, "I'm with you so it's all right".

59
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,919
He really seemed so reliable!

60
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,119
Well... good for you.

61
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,819
Come on!

62
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,819
Then just in case,

63
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,119
Mr. Handa is said to have been taking a nap during the blackout,

64
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,419
please lead us to your room.

65
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,819
Sure.

66
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,619
Kazuha, you stay with that lady there!

67
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,319
What? Why?

68
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,819
You annoy me when you're around.

69
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,519
What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,419
Maybe it's because...

71
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,219
Maybe he's burning with jealousy?

72
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:11,719
Burning?

73
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:14,919
Heiji's not red because of the sunburn.

74
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,919
I don't mean that.

75
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,419
So, this is the room Mr. Handa used

76
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,119
when you were still Mr. Masakage's pupils.

77
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,319
That's right.

78
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,219
The bed that was used then

79
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:35,519
was disposed of when Mr. Handa left 10 years ago.

80
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,119
And? Where were you and Mr. Handa when there was a blackout?

81
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:44,119
When I opened the door, he was lying down on the sofa,

82
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,919
and was standing still for about one minute of the blackout.

83
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,019
I told her it wouldn't be a good idea to move around in the dark.

84
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,519
Then who reset the breaker?

85
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,719
I did.

86
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,419
Me and this kid was right by the breaker when it was thrown.

87
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,919
This room definitely is right under the data storage room.

88
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,919
It's impossible to climb out from that small window.

89
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,719
Thought there might be some tricks to the house

90
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,119
since a magician built it.

91
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,519
There seems to be no elevators to carry

92
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,119
Ms. Tenko's body to the 2nd floor.

93
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:28,019
If you and Mr. Handa was in this room during the blackout,

94
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,419
it would be impossible to commit the crime.

95
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,519
When Ms. Tenko's body was found, Mr. Hoshikawa who was the closest

96
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,919
was being clung onto by Kazuha

97
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,319
couldn't have put the body there.

98
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,019
Then the crime must have been committed by someone from outside.

99
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,019
Inspector Megure!

100
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,219
Huh?

101
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,819
What is it?

102
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,119
When I investigated the shrubbery,

103
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,219
I found some broken branches and footprints all around

104
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:57,119
that seemed to have been smoothed out.

105
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:00,919
That shrubbery is right under Mr. Masakage's room.

106
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,819
Hattori! Just like you said.

107
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,819
The culprit was hiding in the storage room,

108
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,919
threw the breaker and left the body

109
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,119
and went into Mr. Masakage's room,

110
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,219
leaped from the window and used the shrubbery as cushion.

111
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:15,919
He seems to have escaped from the backdoor.

112
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,919
Okay!

113
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,119
Ask around the neighborhood if anyone has seen a suspicious figure.

114
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,319
Yes, sir!

115
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:24,919
If it's an outsider...

116
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,019
The rest should be left in the hands of the police.

117
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,219
-Our role... -is finished.

118
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
I see.

119
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
So, that's it.

120
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,219
What?

121
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,719
Do you know who did it?

122
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,819
That's right.

123
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,819
The culprit who beat Ms. Tenko to death,

124
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,019
used this as a trick to cover up the crime.

125
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,119
Trick?

126
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,819
I will show you the trick,

127
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,919
so let me borrow your tall officer and fat officer.

128
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,919
Tall one? Fat one?

129
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,719
Oh, Takagi and Chiba!

130
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,319
I'll let you borrow them but what are you planning to do?

131
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,619
You don't mean to use them as a guinea pig in a dangerous trick.

132
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,419
No need to worry.

133
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,019
I understand you being worried about your men.

134
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,919
Hey Hattori, are you okay?

135
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,919
He's okay!

136
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,719
Bring everyone to where Ms. Tenko's body was found

137
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:49,719
in the hallway on the 2nd floor in 10 minutes!

138
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:52,619
You will be surprised too!

139
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:56,919
Is what Brother Heiji was saying! Right?

140
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,219
Yeah.

141
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,519
I'm counting on you, Hattori.

142
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,419
Right! I'll get Takagi and Chiba to come to this room.

143
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:13,019
Will Mr. Handa and Mrs. Masakage please go back to your rooms and wait?

144
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,819
Get Mr. Hoshikawa too.

145
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:18,619
Yes. Then I'll go to the living room.

146
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:25,019
Hey, Kudo.

147
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,319
I think I got it.

148
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:30,619
That's why we're gathering everyone up.

149
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:31,819
No, not that!

150
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,019
I'm not talking about the case.

151
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,219
I'm talking about why there was something about Kazuha

152
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:37,419
that was annoying me!

153
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,719
Well, good for you.

154
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,619
It's almost 10 minutes.

155
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,719
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

156
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,819
Then, can you all step up on the stage

157
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:52,919
where I will unravel the mystery,

158
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,719
of course, with the culprit who is among us.

159
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,219
Huh?

160
00:09:58,219 --> 00:09:59,619
The killer is...

161
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:01,819
Among us?

162
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,241
But, Hattori!

163
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,241
You just said!

164
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:18,741
The culprit who killed Ms. Tenko was an outsider!

165
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:20,741
The intruder's target

166
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:24,641
was Mr. Masakage's notes in the storage room on the 2nd floor

167
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:28,241
down the hall to the right!

168
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,941
And Ms. Tenko ran into him when he was looking for the book,

169
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,441
was killed,

170
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:36,841
and afterwards, Mr. Hoshikawa, Kazuha and Ran came in.

171
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,241
After the blackout,

172
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:41,341
the culprit put Ms. Tenko's body at the end of the hallway,

173
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,541
went into Mr. Masakage's room down the hall to the left

174
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,041
and escaped from the window.

175
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:51,541
There were works on the hallway switch to make it look like a blackout.

176
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,641
During the blackout,

177
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:56,141
Mr. Handa and Mrs. Masakage were in the room downstairs,

178
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:59,541
Mr. Hoshikawa was being clung onto by Kazuha and Ran

179
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,041
and couldn't move.

180
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,441
If it wasn't an outsider,

181
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:10,741
how would someone among the three put Ms. Tenko's body over there?

182
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:15,141
Also Mrs. Masakage, you said that,

183
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,441
5 years ago, a suspicious person who called Mr. Masakage,

184
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:22,541
your husband a phony visited.

185
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,441
If there's anyone to be suspicious about, wouldn't it be him?

186
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,941
The man that visited many times,

187
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,241
didn't he have a habit or something?

188
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,741
Huh? Habit?

189
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:41,341
I don't know. There might have been, but it's been 5 years...

190
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,141
For example,

191
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:48,041
pushing up the middle of his sunglasses with his left hand little finger.

192
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,841
Right, right! That habit...

193
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,741
What?

194
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:55,041
Why does Heiji know?

195
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,941
I don't know

196
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,941
but I know that what Mrs. Masakage is saying

197
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:01,641
the person in the very right of this picture,

198
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:05,441
the man with a hat, sunglasses, and a moustache is the one!

199
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,441
Isn't it...

200
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,641
Mr. Handa when he was young?

201
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:13,741
That's right. Mr. Handa pushed up the middle of his sunglasses

202
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,241
with his left hand little finger.

203
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:20,641
Then, the suspicious man Mrs. Masakage met 5 years ago

204
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:21,941
was Mr. Handa.

205
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,341
Stupid!

206
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,341
If that man was Mr. Handa who was living in this house

207
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:28,941
as Mr. Masakage's pupil,

208
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:31,441
Mrs. Masakage would've recognized him!

209
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:33,841
Oh, that's true.

210
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:36,641
Well, that's to say... when people say things that's not true

211
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,441
but actually sounds like it's true,

212
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:43,941
they usually visualize someone they know in their heads!

213
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:47,441
It would be bothersome if things don't add up later on.

214
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,941
And that someone is...

215
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:53,641
Mr. Handa when he was young!

216
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:58,141
I see. If that man's habit is just like Mr. Handa's,

217
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,941
Mrs. Masakage will have no problem recognizing it,

218
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:03,141
so it will not be suspected.

219
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,641
But...

220
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,541
Why lie like that...

221
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,641
She realized who the culprit was

222
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:13,641
from where Ms. Tenko's body lay

223
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:16,241
and from the state the body was found.

224
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,641
Mr. Hoshikawa...

225
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:21,141
you are the murderer!

226
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:28,141
Then Mrs. Masakage, you covered up for Mr. Hoshikawa.

227
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,941
No, that can't be true!

228
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,441
When Mr. Hoshikawa found Ms. Tenko,

229
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:35,841
I was clinging on to him so he wasn't able to move.

230
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:40,741
That's why I'm going to unravel that mystery right now!

231
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,541
Look at this, this hallway.

232
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,941
It's the same as last time, right?

233
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:46,741
Yes, just like this.

234
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:48,641
It was poorly-lit

235
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:52,041
but I noticed there was nothing at the end of the hallway.

236
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,441
Well, at that time,

237
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:58,241
I was holding on to Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this!

238
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:59,441
Stupid!

239
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,541
You're too close!

240
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,341
So you won't play any tricks on me!

241
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,841
So behave!

242
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:05,841
Hey.

243
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:08,141
Hey, so hurry up and unravel the mystery!

244
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:12,641
When Mr. Hoshikawa pressed this switch,

245
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,441
you said it blacked out.

246
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,941
If it blacked out, the breaker...

247
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,341
Conan?

248
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,841
Since when were you there?

249
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,241
How did you...

250
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,841
I was here all the time.

251
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,741
Don't lie to me!

252
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:34,841
When it got dark,

253
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,841
you came out of the storage room, didn't you?

254
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,441
No.

255
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:42,441
I was here in this storage room the whole time

256
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,541
but the door didn't open.

257
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,541
But I didn't see Conan.

258
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:51,941
Huh? What?

259
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,341
What is it, Conan?

260
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,241
-Huh? -Disappeared?

261
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:58,941
We didn't disappear!

262
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,541
Conan?

263
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,741
Like this.

264
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:07,541
Brother Heiji just moved Mr. Masakage's room door like this.

265
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,441
During the blackout.

266
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,941
Just like Mr. Hoshikawa did.

267
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,041
That can't be true!

268
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,941
This is...

269
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,741
Isn't it similar? This room...

270
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:30,741
looks just like the end of the hallway.

271
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,941
The door of the storage room is that closet.

272
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:39,541
The right wall is this screen!

273
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,041
And...

274
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,241
The small window at the end of the hallway is...

275
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:50,541
The big window hidden by this sideboard.

276
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,941
This is the door in front of Mr. Masakage's room that can be seen.

277
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:56,241
And...

278
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:02,041
if behind Mr. Masakage's room door is the mirror...

279
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,941
You can tell already, right?

280
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:07,241
Before the blackout, what Kazuha and Ran saw

281
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:13,241
was the room seen as reflected in the mirror behind the door!

282
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,741
Then, the body was at the end of the hallway from the very beginning?

283
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:20,641
So during the blackout,

284
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:25,541
Mr. Hoshikawa shut the mirror door and showed it!

285
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:30,641
But when we entered the room, there was no mirror in back of the door.

286
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:34,641
That's right, that's right! There was no extra door at all!

287
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,141
Conan?

288
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:40,041
This door is some door

289
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:45,341
move the mirror by the knob and put the door together.

290
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:48,941
And it becomes one door. Some trick!

291
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,341
You noticed the trick because the door was too thick

292
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:55,041
and the line down the center, right?

293
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,041
Yes.

294
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,441
And also

295
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:59,641
because of the uncomfortable feeling Kazuha and that lady

296
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,441
-was talking about! -Huh?

297
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:06,541
You were saying, before and after Ms. Tenko's body was found,

298
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,641
the shadow of the vase was different.

299
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:12,641
I was convinced as I recalled that

300
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:15,441
before and after Ms. Tenko's body was found,

301
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,441
it must have been a different place

302
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:20,241
where the moonlight was cast differently.

303
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:24,041
But this house is a convenient house for tricks.

304
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,541
Of course,

305
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,141
this door, room, hallway,

306
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:34,041
Mr. Masakage made everything in order to play this trick.

307
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,441
What?

308
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:38,341
Bring the guests to this hallway.

309
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:40,841
When he turns off the light closes the door,

310
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:44,041
and shows the Christmas tree at the end of the hall

311
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,841
and surprises everyone with the magic.

312
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,941
So that's it!

313
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,841
That's why Mrs. Masakage knew that Mr. Hoshikawa

314
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:53,541
was the culprit from the beginning.

315
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:57,741
But, wasn't it you who wanted to come here, Mr. Handa?

316
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:02,141
Mr. Hoshikawa didn't intend to kill.

317
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,241
His intent to kill probably developed

318
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:06,741
when Ms. Tenko said she was going to do

319
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,941
the trick "Witch Reborn" in the next show.

320
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,341
No.

321
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:13,441
Actually it's "The Resurrection of the Devil",

322
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:17,341
the title of the magic Mr. Masakage thought of.

323
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:21,941
-Huh? -The same stage setup and performance.

324
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,941
I realized right away

325
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:27,041
that she looked at Mr. Masakage's trick book

326
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,441
and was going to copy it.

327
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,241
The magic that had been sealed because it was too dangerous.

328
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:36,241
That miracle magic.

329
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,041
But, she was just going to steal the master's trick.

330
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,441
She didn't know that.

331
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,241
Everyone, in other words, we discussed

332
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:46,641
and decided not to do that magic

333
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:50,841
because it was before she became my husband's pupil.

334
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:53,241
Mrs. Masakage covered up for me

335
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:57,541
when she said the book was in the storage room.

336
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,941
Master always carried the book around.

337
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:07,341
But one day ten years ago, he misplaced the trick book

338
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:11,741
and said he was going to go look for it but never came back.

339
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:16,141
I thought it was strange for her to be able to look at the book

340
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:20,241
so I called her to the teacher's room and confronted her.

341
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,541
That's right, I stole it.

342
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,941
I am clever with by hands by profession.

343
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:29,341
I was going to return it to the teacher when he returned

344
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,141
but I didn't think he would be so shocked

345
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,941
as to disappear from before everyone.

346
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,041
But...

347
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,241
the teacher who was always telling us to surpass him

348
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:41,541
didn't realize that he was betrayed.

349
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,141
It was probably his time to quit

350
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,841
as a magician.

351
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:54,641
Well, if I perform Mr. Masakage's not-yet-performed magic

352
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,541
all over the world,

353
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,541
the master will be happy from under the sod, don't you think?

354
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,841
That's why you killed her?

355
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:14,741
My mind went into total panic, and when I snapped back to myself,

356
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:17,741
she was all bloody lying in front of me.

357
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:22,041
I recalled the master's Christmas tree magic

358
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,841
and used that to make it look like an outsider had killed her.

359
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,341
Then you broke the branches in the shrubbery,

360
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,741
and erased the footprints.

361
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,141
Yes.

362
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:38,841
Probably, the weapon was the vase in Masakage's room.

363
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:42,841
There was blood on the base of the vase

364
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,641
and maybe a few drops of blood got on Mr. Hoshikawa's black clothes.

365
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:50,041
The evidence is all over the place.

366
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,941
I failed as a magician.

367
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,341
You're a failure even if you're not a magician!

368
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:57,041
Brace yourself.

369
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:01,641
Unlike magic, your charge will not disappear easily.

370
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,241
Wow, what can you expect of Hattori!

371
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,141
It was excellent deduction!

372
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:47,241
You are no less than Kudo, maybe even more!

373
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,741
Inspector, you think so too?

374
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:55,241
By the way, Brother Heiji, weren't you saying?

375
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,541
Huh?

376
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,441
That you get annoyed when Sister Kazuha is friendly with other men!

377
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,541
Huh?

378
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,041
What does that mean?

379
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:08,941
Oh, that's right! Now I know why.

380
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,641
Huh? What?

381
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:15,041
I probably think of you...

382
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,341
What?

383
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:20,541
No. No, Heiji, not in front of everyone.

384
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,241
As my henchman.

385
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:23,841
Huh?

386
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:26,041
What did you just say?

387
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,141
Henchman, my henchman!

388
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:32,541
As the boss, I wouldn't feel good if you wag your tail at someone else,

389
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,141
I'll lose face, right?

390
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:37,441
That's why I was annoyed!

391
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:39,641
Why should I be your henchman?

392
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,941
Your father is my father's henchman!

393
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:43,941
So, of course you're my henchman!

394
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,341
That night, I got mail from Ran.

395
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:55,441
P.S. Shinichi, I hope you don't think of me as your henchman?

396
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:57,841
Hey, hey.

397
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,968
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:33,968 --> 00:24:36,168
"Taketori Story"

399
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:38,068
Conan is now in 3D!

400
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,668
Come see us at Tempozan, Osaka during summer vacation!
