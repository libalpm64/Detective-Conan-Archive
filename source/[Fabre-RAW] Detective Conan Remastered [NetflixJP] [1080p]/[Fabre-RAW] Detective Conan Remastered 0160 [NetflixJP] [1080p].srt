1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,010
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,810
Once he gets started, you can't stop him.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,610
Today we solve the mystery of the legend!

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,710
The trick and the evidence are beyond your imagination.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,410
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,410
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,010
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,350
We come to an old temple while on vacation.

9
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,550
But development of a tourist attraction

10
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,050
has brought trouble with the tour company.

11
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,250
And the next morning,

12
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,750
the president of the tour company,

13
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,950
Hideaki Oda, is found hanging from the pagoda,

14
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,150
Exactly like the legend surrounding the pagoda...

15
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,450
It was a just reward.

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,550
There's no mistake!

17
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,750
This is where it really happened!

18
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,850
If my theory is correct...

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,650
Mr. Oda didn't commit suicide!

20
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,150
He was murdered!

21
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,850
And the killer most probably is

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,750
the one who said what did...

23
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
It's him.

24
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,850
"The Terrifying Legend of the Five-story Pagoda (Part 2)"

25
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,150
Hey! What are you doing here!

26
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,550
Isn't that tie pin over there Mr. Oda's?

27
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,850
What?

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,350
How about it, Mr. Mouri?

29
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,950
Is it Mr. Oda's tie pin?

30
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,850
Yes, most likely.

31
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,750
Diamond tie pins aren't very common!

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,050
Mr. Kajimura, I'd like you to look at this too.

33
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,350
"Yousuke Kajimura (43)" -Yes! There's no mistake.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,850
This belongs to Mr. Oda!

35
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,450
"Tan Kai (64)" -There, you see.

36
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,150
"Juukichi Okabe (55)" -And you accused us of being thieves!

37
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,250
"Shun Kai (26)" -His wallet is probably around here somewhere too.

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,750
How about doing a thorough search?

39
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,950
Well... Now we know Mr. Oda wasn't robbed!

40
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,450
His tie pin probably fell when he hung himself.

41
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,450
But Mr. Mouri! The pagoda is over 10m from here!

42
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,750
If it dropped at the time of the suicice,

43
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,950
don't you think it's a bit too far to fall?

44
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,750
It could have happened like this!

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,250
Mr. Oda was deciding whether to kill himself here or not!

46
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,350
And he didn't realize it fell off!

47
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,350
But tie pins don't fall off so easily!

48
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,050
Excuse me.

49
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,950
There were grass stains on Mr. Oda's elbow.

50
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,650
So what?

51
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,750
Wasn't the tie pin found here?

52
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,150
That's it! So the stains from the grass around here!

53
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,450
Mr. Mouri! I'm positive Mr. Oda struggled with someone here and fell!

54
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,750
And another thing,

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,950
when they were taking the body down,

56
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,350
the rope was too short.

57
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,250
Mr. Oda's feet didn't reach the railing.

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,450
What? Hey, officers!

59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,050
When you were lowering the body did his feet reach the railing?

60
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,650
No, sir! It was about 50cm short!

61
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,250
How can it be?

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,250
If he stood on the railing

63
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,050
and the rope didn't reach his neck,

64
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,950
he couldn't have comitted suicide!

65
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,650
Mr. Mouri! How do you explain this?

66
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,250
Don't worry about it.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,050
It doesn't mean a thing.

68
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,850
What do you mean?

69
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,350
After a lot of deliberation,

70
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,450
Mr. Oda climbed the pagoda to kill himself!

71
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,450
The rope may have been 50cm short,

72
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,450
but there was no turning back!

73
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,350
In other words, he jumped to the rope

74
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,450
and put it over his head!

75
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,450
But there are so many circumstances indicating it was murder!

76
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,550
All right. Let's just say for the time being that it was murder!

77
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,250
The killer would have to carry

78
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,250
the hefty, unconscious Mr. Oda up the narrow stairway

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,450
wide enough for only one person,

80
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,450
the killer would have to drag the body!

81
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,250
But there was no indication of this

82
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,050
on either the body or the pagoda!

83
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,050
Moreover, how could the killer hang Mr. Oda

84
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,950
with a rope 50cm too short?

85
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,550
Yes, that's true!

86
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,850
The murder theory is beginning to sound far fetched.

87
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,650
That's right! Unless it was suicide,

88
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,450
there's no way he could have hung from the pagoda!

89
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,850
It looks like you showing everyone how stupid you are!

90
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,050
You're nothing but a mere human.

91
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,750
You'll never be able to solve the mysteries of heaven's wrath!

92
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,750
Give up and leave this place at once!

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,250
Why you...

94
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,650
It's true, there are many unanswered questions

95
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,250
but there's not enough evidence

96
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,650
to prove this was a murder made to look like suicide.

97
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,450
But this case is definitely a murder!

98
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,550
The problem is...

99
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,250
How did the killer hang him from the roof of the pagoda?

100
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,450
Unless I can solve this trick,

101
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,250
this case will be classified a suicide!

102
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,050
This was the end tied to the railing

103
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,650
Why did the killer use a slipknot to tie it?

104
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,850
That's it!

105
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,950
There's this method!

106
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,250
The fog is finally starting to clear!

107
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,750
Using this method,

108
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,250
it's possible to tie the rope to the railing!

109
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,550
Hey, kid!

110
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,550
You're not supposed to touch the things around here!

111
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,150
I am sorry.

112
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,050
If my theory is correct...

113
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,150
That thing should be around here!

114
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,750
There it is!

115
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,450
No doubt about it!

116
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,350
Mr. Oda's death can be made to look like suicide

117
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,750
with this method.

118
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,750
A fresh scratch is on it.

119
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,950
Curse, you say?

120
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,450
You thought up one fantastic trick,

121
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,850
using the legend as your guide!

122
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,550
But now for the evidence!

123
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,750
I have to find proof that show he's the murderer!

124
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,550
This was a strange suicide

125
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,250
but it's settled now!

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,750
Are you sure?

127
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,050
Something about it still bothers me.

128
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,950
What? Why are you so stubborn?

129
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,350
All right then go ahead.

130
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,750
Write down on your report. Death by curse.

131
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,750
You... You got to be kidding!

132
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,450
If I do that, I'll be laughed at!

133
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,350
Excuse me...

134
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,050
Would it be all right if I returned to the hotel now?

135
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,150
I'm sure the employees are shaken up by this.

136
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,750
Let's see.

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,150
I suppose it'll be all right.

138
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,250
But to be on the safe side,

139
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,150
give me your contact number.

140
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,950
I'll be at the hotel, so...

141
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,350
Look at all that money.

142
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,950
Thank you very much, son.

143
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,050
Here we are.

144
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,250
You can reach me here.

145
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,650
Yes. I'll do that.

146
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,750
Mr. Kajimura, you sure have a lot of money on you.

147
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,050
It couldn't be Mr. Oda's, could it?

148
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,450
Of course not!

149
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,250
Mr. Oda's wallet is another color!

150
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,150
His money is for the payment I have to make

151
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,050
to one of the hotel's suppliers today!

152
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,450
It was just a joke, a joke!

153
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,950
You scared me.

154
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,450
Hey! Now that Mr. Odas dead,

155
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,950
the plans for that amusement park are dead too, aren't they?

156
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,550
Yes.

157
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,950
If construction isn't stopped right away,

158
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,750
our company will go bankrupt.

159
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm sure the deed to the temple will be returned to you.

160
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,550
What? Really?

161
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,050
Yes!

162
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,850
Mr. Oda gave me the deed to hold on to.

163
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,350
I think it's best if I gave it back to you now.

164
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,750
Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Tan Kai?

165
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Mr. Kajimura, you are a very understanding man!

166
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,950
I was wrong about you!

167
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,850
That's very flattering.

168
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,350
As for the incident of the deed,

169
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,450
I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding between you two.

170
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,350
In lieu of Mr. Oda's last act of generosity,

171
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,650
I will recite a prayer for him!

172
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,850
Now that my mind is at ease,

173
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,450
I can go back to the head temple and resume my training!

174
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,050
If I leave now, I'll get there by evening.

175
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,250
I'll start cleaning the pagoda.

176
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,650
I've found it!

177
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,650
The undeniable, solid proof!

178
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,150
He's the murderer after all.

179
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,240
Officer Yokomizo...

180
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,440
What do we do now?

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
Mr. Mouri.

182
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,540
This case is definitely a suicide!

183
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,040
Yes, I see.

184
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,740
Since you're so sure about it.

185
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,140
I was forced out of bed so early this morning,

186
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,840
I am so sleepy.

187
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,740
I am going to the hotel and get some sleep.

188
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,140
What time? Oh no! I'm so sleepy.

189
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,340
Now to put this button speaker

190
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,240
on Pops Kogoro's forehead.

191
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,440
I have no choice.

192
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
All right! This is a suicide case!

193
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
We're going back to the station!

194
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,340
Just one moment

195
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Officer Yokomizo, you are absolutely hopeless.

196
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,140
Are you talking about me?

197
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,540
You were being given so many hints,

198
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,140
why didn't you realize that?

199
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,040
This was no suicide.

200
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,740
It's murder!

201
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,140
I knew it!

202
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,940
But, Mr. Mouri...

203
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,540
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

204
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,140
Because I wanted you to solve it and get the credit!

205
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,940
Is that so?

206
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,840
Forgive me for being so dense.

207
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
It couldn't be helped.

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Now pay close attention to my mystery solving show.

209
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,940
Now, Officer Yokomizo...

210
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,140
I would like to conduct an experiment.

211
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,740
May I enlist the aid of your officers?

212
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,440
Of course you may!

213
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,040
Officers! Get ready!

214
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,140
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

215
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,340
First, we'll put a bag

216
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,740
weighing the same as Mr. Oda on the grass,

217
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,240
tie a rope around the bag's head.

218
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,940
Take the rope up to the level five of the pagoda

219
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,840
and drape it over the edge of the roof.

220
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,540
Then you pass it through the railing until it reaches the ground

221
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,040
and tie it to the scrap metal left

222
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,640
on the old unused well!

223
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,640
And to make one side of the scrap metal easier to drop,

224
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,540
it is placed atop a steel rod!

225
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
Here you are!

226
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,940
Now, Officer Yokomizo,

227
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,240
pull hard on that string!

228
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
It... It's hanging?

229
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,040
Just like Mr. Oda was.

230
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,840
What do you think?

231
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,640
This is the identity of your so-called curse!

232
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,540
The rope was charred

233
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,640
because it rubbed on the edge of the roof,

234
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,940
causing friction!

235
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,340
And although the rope was brand new,

236
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,140
it was frayed because of the friction!

237
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,540
And since we found the tie pin on the grass,

238
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,540
I assume that's where it happened!

239
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,940
But how did the killer get the rope around Mr. Oda's neck?

240
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,740
Mr. Oda would have put up a fight

241
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,040
but examination of the body showed no such marks!

242
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,740
Yes, that's a very good question!

243
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,640
Let me explain things in the order it happened...

244
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,440
First, the killer called Mr.Oda to meet him here.

245
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,240
Then when he saw the opportunity,

246
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,540
he put the noose around Mr. Oda's neck.

247
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,240
And pulled the string at the same time.

248
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Dropping the scrap metal into the well.

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,440
But there's a time lag

250
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,040
before Mr. Oda is pulled up,

251
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,340
the rope around his neck would come off!

252
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,240
So the killer grabbed his legs causing him to fall!

253
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,740
Since it dark,

254
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,240
even a slim man would be able to topple

255
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,940
a large man like Mr. Oda who's caught off guard!

256
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,840
The grass stains on his elbow

257
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,440
also happened at that time.

258
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,940
This is when the tie pin also fell.

259
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,140
Mr. Oda had no time to undo the rope,

260
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,640
he was pulled up.

261
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,740
I am positive Mr. Oda was tripped!

262
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,340
If he wasn't,

263
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,540
there would be no way

264
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,240
he would get dirt on the heels of his shoes!

265
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,140
I get it!

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,640
No.

267
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,540
Wait a minute, Mr. Mouri!

268
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,140
Are you saying more than one killer was involved?

269
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,240
It seems you've come across that dilemma, Officer Yokomizo!

270
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,740
After all, Mr. Oda weighs 100kg!

271
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,040
If the killer tried to tie the rope to the railing alone,

272
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,240
he wouldn't be able to bind the rope around his hand,

273
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
only squeeze it!

274
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,940
The moment the rope was cut,

275
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,940
it would be pulled out of his hand!

276
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,040
In other word, it's not possible

277
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
to tie the rope to the railing by himself!

278
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
But it is possible!

279
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
Even if the killer was alone!

280
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,540
That's ridiculous!

281
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,440
Exactly how was it done?

282
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,740
The killer used a slipknot on the railing!

283
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,440
A slipknot?

284
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,640
It forms a loop on the rope.

285
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,440
I've given instructions to the officer on the pagoda.

286
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,740
Please have him do it.

287
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Hey! Cut the rope and tie it to the railing!

288
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,240
Yes, sir!

289
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
First, he needs to pull the slipknot loop

290
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
pass a stick into the loop

291
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,040
to make a stopper.

292
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Then he cuts the rope on the outside,

293
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,740
pulls the cut end through the loop and ties it.

294
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,740
The stick is pulled and the ruse is complete!

295
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,040
Officer Yokomizo!

296
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,240
The rope is tied to the railing!

297
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,040
It's possible to do it alone.

298
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,640
All that is left is to collect the rope that has fallen

299
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,340
and throw it into the legendary old well!

300
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,240
With this I ends my explanation

301
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
of how the curse was used to cover up a murder.

302
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,740
The only mistake the killer made was

303
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,640
the 50cm difference between Mr. Oda's feet and the railing.

304
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,540
Because that's what

305
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,340
aroused my suspicion

306
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,740
that it wasn't suicide!

307
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,340
Then the only one who is capable of rigging all of this

308
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,840
is someone who is familiar with the temple.

309
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,240
Hold on there!

310
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Are you insinuating one of us is the killer?

311
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,740
That's right!

312
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,940
The man responsible for this charade is...

313
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,740
Mr. Kajimura!

314
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,140
Yes, the killer is you!

315
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,640
Mr. Mouri, you can't be serious!

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,940
I don't know very much about this temple!

317
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,840
You are the general manager of the Hotel Oda,

318
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,940
but you are also an executive of Oda Tours!

319
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,540
It's easy for you to get the blueprint to this place,

320
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
by saying it's for the construction of the amusement park.

321
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,240
Then you can calculate the height of the pagoda,

322
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,540
the distance to the well and its depth... everything!

323
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,740
And wasn't it you who told the construction workers

324
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,840
to put the scrap metal near the well?

325
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,540
So you could use it in your scheme.

326
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,740
Yes, I may have given the orders!

327
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,440
But if I did, it was due to some work related matter!

328
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,740
Besides, Mr.Mouri, you too are aware

329
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,040
that I was on a business trip last night,

330
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,940
I wasn't even here!

331
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,640
Then how did you know

332
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,940
about Mr. Shun Kai and Mr. Oda's argument last night?

333
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,340
Then you came here today, you said...

334
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,840
But last night,

335
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,140
when he was threatened

336
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,140
to be taken to court by the temple,

337
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,540
he seemed very concerned.

338
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,840
Shun Kai came back last night

339
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,940
right after you left!

340
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,240
But how did you know about that?

341
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,740
That's because I had a call.

342
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,840
Mr. Oda called me on my cellular at the hotel in Tokyo.

343
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
No. You're lying.

344
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,840
You heard their conversation right here on these grounds!

345
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,740
When you called Mr. Oda to meet you here

346
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,940
so you could kill him!

347
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,140
Enough of this foolishness!

348
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,240
All you have are accusations!

349
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,540
Show me some proof!

350
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,840
Proof that I was here last night!

351
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,740
You have the evidence on you!

352
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,440
The irrefutable evidence!

353
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,640
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

354
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,940
Yes, look inside his wallet.

355
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,640
May I?

356
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,540
If you're talking about Mr. Oda's fingerprints on the bills,

357
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,940
that won't be proof.

358
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,140
He gave me the money himself!

359
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,840
Mr. Mouri, what am I looking for?

360
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,340
It should be stuck between the bills!

361
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,240
It's a receipt!

362
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,340
A receipt?

363
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,540
Let's see... It's a receipt for the Hotel Oda.

364
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,740
September 12th, 19:40.

365
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,240
For cigars.

366
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,640
-What? -That's right!

367
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,140
We saw Mr. Oda get that receipt last night

368
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,140
while we were having dinner!

369
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,740
You left after that

370
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,240
and if you hadn't seen him since then,

371
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,640
tell us how the receipt ended up in your wallet?

372
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,540
I'm pretty sure after you killed Mr. Oda,

373
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,240
you saw his wallet lying in the grass

374
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,140
so you decided to keep the money as cash earned!

375
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,640
But you didn't notice that

376
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,340
the receipt stuck between the bill!

377
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,440
If you check the receipt,

378
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,340
you'll find Mr. Oda's fingerprints on it!

379
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,840
What do you have to say about that, Mr. Kajimura!

380
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,440
Are you still going to deny it?

381
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,940
How stupid...

382
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,540
What a silly thing to get caught by...

383
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,140
What was your motive?

384
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,740
Taxes...

385
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,540
When the company began having financial difficulties,

386
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,040
Mr.Oda told me to file a fake financial report.

387
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,540
Sure, I profited from the scheme too

388
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,440
but then I realized he was letting me profit

389
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,040
only because he eventually intended

390
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,840
to make me take the fall for everything..

391
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,940
So you killed him.

392
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,240
Yes...

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,140
Before he chopped me off like some lizard's tail,

394
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,440
after I've worked myself to the bone for the company.

395
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,940
I thought we were going to enjoy ourselves.

396
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,640
Why is that every time you're with us,

397
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,940
we get involved in a case, dad?

398
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,440
How would I know?

399
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,740
Dad, is there any possibility that you're cursed?

400
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,240
There are people right here.

401
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,040
Why don't we have you exorcised?

402
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,640
That's ridiculous!

403
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,340
I am a private detective!

404
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,440
I'm supposed to be involved with cases!

405
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,140
That's what feeds us!

406
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,940
Trouble is my business!

407
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,840
Cases are supposed to follow a famous detective around!

408
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,140
Dad?

409
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,140
He's right, he's never lacking trouble.
