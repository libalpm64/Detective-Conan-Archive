1
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:12,621
Awesome!

2
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:14,321
We sure caught a lot.

3
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:17,997
All together there are probably about 20 fish.

4
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,021
I guess we're eating fish for dinner

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,721
at doctor's house today then.

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:25,321
Well, I'm a bit worried

7
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,121
because doctor's the one who's going to be preparing the fish.

8
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:30,009
You're really something, Genta.

9
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,321
You caught another black sea bream again?

10
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:34,321
You're really an expert fisherman already.

11
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,021
Well, sort of.

12
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,421
I was actually going after eels,

13
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,721
but I guess I didn't make it.

14
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:43,421
All you ever think about is...

15
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,121
eating eels.

16
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,821
Let's eat.

17
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:50,821
Okay, everybody, time to put your things away.

18
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,021
We'd better start getting ready to go home.

19
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,035
The ship's come to get us.

20
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,721
True.

21
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,821
-Doctor! -Doctor!

22
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:05,821
Thank you Mr. Ejiri, for looking after us.

23
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,821
No, no, no problem.

24
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:11,121
After all Dr. Agasa and you saved my life in the past, remember?

25
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,021
Looking after you all in his place

26
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,721
because he had to go home for a while is no problem for me.

27
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,621
We ran into Mr. Futoshi Ejiri

28
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:23,421
before when we came here to fish,

29
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:27,321
and got messed up in a case.

30
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,069
Thanks to the prompt treatment doctor and I gave him,

31
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:33,121
his life was saved.

32
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:36,075
What a relief to see him in good health.

33
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,077
Doctor!

34
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:41,121
We got big catch!

35
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,921
-Doctor? -Doctor?

36
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,083
Doctor?

37
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,421
That's not doctor.

38
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,421
He's the man living next door to doctor, isn't he?

39
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,421
If I remember correctly,

40
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,721
he's an upper graduate at the university

41
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,421
named Mr. Subaru Okiya.

42
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,021
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

43
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,621
Saturday nights are for mystery.

44
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:23,521
Fish messages left behind on a Dragon legend rock.

45
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,121
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,021
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,021
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

48
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:15,948
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 1)"

49
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:21,148
Doctor's not able to come?

50
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:22,241
For real?

51
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:26,245
No, the ham and egg making device that he made

52
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,648
and passed out to the neighbors isn't working right...

53
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,348
and it seems he's being bombarded by complaints.

54
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,048
He thought that he could repair it right away

55
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:41,548
but he thinks it's going to take way longer than he expected,

56
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,248
so he asked me to come and pick you all up instead.

57
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:48,267
That device wasn't all that stable to begin with anyway.

58
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,548
Okay, you can continue talking after boarding the ship.

59
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:53,648
Hurry or the sun will go down.

60
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,148
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir...

61
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:59,748
Here, next.

62
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:01,248
It's your turn.

63
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:02,281
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,283
Be careful of your footsteps.

65
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:05,148
Yes.

66
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:11,348
What's wrong with you? From a while ago.

67
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,748
I sense something in him.

68
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:15,548
Him?

69
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,648
You mean Mr. Subaru Okiya?

70
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,748
Just what do you sense?

71
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:20,948
In your words,

72
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,048
I sense the smell of the Black Organization.

73
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,648
You mean you sense it even now?

74
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:31,548
No.

75
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:35,348
The only time I felt that way was the time I first saw him

76
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:38,317
during that fire incident, but...

77
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:05,048
That unique overpowering air about him.

78
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,048
No matter how I look at it, it's all around him.

79
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,048
No doubt it's the air of the organization

80
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:11,248
that shrunk your body.

81
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:16,348
Maybe you're just psyching yourself into thinking that way?

82
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:18,357
Come on, come on. What's keeping you?

83
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,648
Hurry and get on board you two.

84
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,648
Okay.

85
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,648
You should look where you're going.

86
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:50,848
Okay.

87
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,397
Okay, Ida, I'll see you later.

88
00:06:58,397 --> 00:06:59,448
Yes.

89
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,748
But, how sad, that we don't get to eat this

90
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:07,548
when we caught so many.

91
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,848
Doctor sure seems to be busy.

92
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:15,548
If you like, would you like me to prepare the fish for you?

93
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:18,148
You mean, you can cook?

94
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:21,048
Yes. Just a bit.

95
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:24,048
Of course, I'm not a first class cook

96
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,425
but I can make home-made cooking.

97
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,848
So, I'll use the kitchen at doctor's house

98
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,248
and cook you guys dinner.

99
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:32,848
-All right. -All right.

100
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:34,148
A treat.

101
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,948
Hey, kids, watch.

102
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,848
A beautiful sunset, don't you think?

103
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,048
Awesome.

104
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,348
It almost looks like a picture postcard.

105
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:50,248
I wonder what that is?

106
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:53,048
The sharp looking thing below the sunset.

107
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,248
That's the Ikkaku Rock.

108
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,048
The Ikkaku Rock?

109
00:07:58,048 --> 00:07:59,248
Long, long ago,

110
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,348
there was a sea dragon

111
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,463
that was said to have one big horn called one-horned dragon.

112
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:08,848
The legend goes that the one-horned dragon who was angered

113
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:11,248
because a fisherman had taken her child,

114
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:15,548
is watching over her habitat sticking one horn out of the sea.

115
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:19,648
Therefore, any fishing boat that approaches is sunk,

116
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:23,848
so the fishermen just look at the Ikkaku Rock from a distance.

117
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:27,248
Would you like to go take a look?

118
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:29,748
It's easy to anchor the ship by that rock.

119
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,493
But, won't our ship sink?

120
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,148
Don't worry.

121
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,497
The one-horned dragon loves children.

122
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,499
If children stop by there,

123
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,501
it is also said that they are giving the power of the sea,

124
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,148
and become good swimmers.

125
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,505
Really?

126
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:47,848
Let's go, let's go.

127
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,513
It's pretty big.

128
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:59,048
Yes. It's a bit eerie when you think that

129
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,148
the gigantic body of the dragon below this.

130
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,948
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

131
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,048
That's the Ikkaku Rock!

132
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,527
If you go near it, you'll be cursed by the dragon

133
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,548
and your ship will sink!

134
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:13,648
They'll be fine, besides they're children.

135
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,535
That's true.

136
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,848
Hey, Kaida.

137
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:21,848
She doesn't seem to be anywhere around here.

138
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:25,748
Rats. Let's try another point.

139
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:34,348
What're those people?

140
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,948
They seem to be looking for something.

141
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,548
They're divers who are going around

142
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:41,248
with the daughter of the president of some big company

143
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,548
that just started diving recently.

144
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:46,048
They sure get in the way of our fishing.

145
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:49,948
The sea is for everyone to use, or rather...

146
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:53,548
I'd sure like them to have a bit more consideration towards us fishermen.

147
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:57,648
Well, but this Ikkaku Rock is a rock for children.

148
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,648
Go enjoy to your heart's content.

149
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:00,848
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

150
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:03,248
Taking a close look at it,

151
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,948
it's more like an ordinary rock with a lot of holes in it,

152
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:07,648
rather than one-horned.

153
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:12,248
Yes. After all it's quite a bit eroded from seawater.

154
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,248
Look. Look.

155
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,648
The sunset.

156
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,948
Let's all take a picture together

157
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,948
before the sun sets completely.

158
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:21,548
Okay, if you don't mind me taking your pictures with my cell phone.

159
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,748
Okay, we're counting on you.

160
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,048
Yes!

161
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,448
Everybody, get in line.

162
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:41,248
The rock behind you...

163
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:43,048
something's written on it.

164
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,623
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish"

165
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:48,948
Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish?

166
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,948
I wonder if someone carved the names of the fish

167
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,631
he caught on the rock as a memento?

168
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,648
What a terrible thing to do.

169
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:57,248
Hey, come over here.

170
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:01,148
There's something stuck between the rocks.

171
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,648
What's this?

172
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,647
It's stuck so hard, that I can't pull it out.

173
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,948
It's a fin that you wear when going diving.

174
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:14,948
The fin is still brand new.

175
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:18,148
If a person leaves the fin behind as a prank,

176
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:20,248
he wouldn't be able to make it back.

177
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:22,661
And, besides, those words...

178
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
Don't tell me it's a message or something?

179
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,048
Is someone still here?

180
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,348
Conan.

181
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,548
A tank and regulator.

182
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:46,685
A diver?

183
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,448
What's with her?

184
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,848
Is she asleep?

185
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,648
No. She's already dead.

186
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,148
-What? -What?

187
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:59,248
Judging from postmortem rigor mortis,

188
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,948
she died several hours ago.

189
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,703
The inside of her mouth is completely dried,

190
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,705
and her skin's lost its elasticity.

191
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,248
So, she must've died of dehydration.

192
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:10,709
Lipstick.

193
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,248
Wait a second.

194
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:16,248
The regulator I saw a while ago.

195
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:21,448
I'm sure that she encountered trouble

196
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,648
while diving that incapacitated her ability to swim.

197
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:25,548
She somehow managed to get here,

198
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,548
but no one discovered her.

199
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,729
Yes, the Ikkaku Rock that sinks ships is here.

200
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,148
No one would dare come close.

201
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:36,748
At any rate, let's all carry her back to the ship.

202
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:38,737
Yes, we can't leave her here like this.

203
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,248
No.

204
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:44,548
It's better not to move the body until the police arrive.

205
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,448
Police?

206
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,448
Don't tell me that she...

207
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:53,348
Yes, it could be that she was deliberately left behind here.

208
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:55,548
Look.

209
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:58,757
The mouthpiece of the regulator from where air from the tank is provided.

210
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,048
It's clean, isn't it?

211
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,763
If the lady wearing lipstick was using it,

212
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,748
lipstick should also be found on the regulator.

213
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:12,771
Just what do you mean?

214
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,048
Somebody for some reason switched the regulator.

215
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:17,248
Most probably within these few hours.

216
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:23,748
That is, the killer who came back here again.

217
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,184
I see.

218
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,184
You stopped by at this Ikkaku Rock

219
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,784
wanting to take a picture of all of you

220
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,884
with the sunset in the background

221
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,799
and you found the body of this young lady.

222
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,784
So, the sunset and everything else went down the drain.

223
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:45,284
Yes.

224
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,184
I can't say anything for sure

225
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:49,684
until we get her back on land and investigate

226
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:53,784
but judging from postmortem rigor mortis and how smoky her cornea are,

227
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:56,815
5-6 hours have passed since she died.

228
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,817
The inside of her mouth is dry

229
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,584
and her skin has lost its elasticity

230
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:03,384
which means she died of dehydration.

231
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,823
In other words, this lady has been here at the Ikkaku Rock

232
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,584
from more than three days ago,

233
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:09,084
with nothing to eat or drink.

234
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:12,184
Since she's wearing a wet suit

235
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,384
and carrying a tank with a regulator,

236
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:15,684
she must be a diver.

237
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,384
Something happened when she was diving,

238
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:21,184
and she somehow managed to make it to the Ikkaku Rock,

239
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:23,184
but nobody found her.

240
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:25,784
That's how most officers would deduce this case,

241
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:27,584
but not me.

242
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,849
As you can see, this lady is wearing lipstick

243
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:33,184
but, there's no lipstick on the regulator.

244
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:38,384
In other words, somebody calculated the time it would take for her to die

245
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:40,884
and returned to switch the regulator after she died,

246
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:44,284
and left the body behind.

247
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,884
I don't know for what reason yet,

248
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:50,869
but I'm sure this is a case of homicide.

249
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,871
Amazing.

250
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,784
No, any police officer will come to that conclusion.

251
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,184
No, I meant Conan.

252
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:03,384
Conan explain exactly what you said just now, officer.

253
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:04,883
You did exactly that, didn't you?

254
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:05,784
Yes.

255
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:12,684
Well, but you sure get yourself tangled in a lot of cases, don't you?

256
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:16,584
Don't tell me you came here knowing that the body was here?

257
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,584
No way.

258
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,584
Although I did think that when we came here somebody might just be here.

259
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,903
What made you think that?

260
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,684
Because of the fin that was poked in between the rocks.

261
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:30,084
In between the rocks on the opposite side,

262
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:33,384
fins that are worn when diving were stuck.

263
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:36,915
He probably thought so when he saw the fins a while ago.

264
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,184
Fins were stuck in between the space of the rocks?

265
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:42,484
Yes, there's practically no one

266
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,923
who would go out of his way to bring a pair of spare fins

267
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,084
to carry out a prank like that.

268
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:49,884
It's most natural to deduce that the owner of those fins

269
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:53,384
tried to leave a message saying that he's still here.

270
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,684
Then, maybe we'll find something written on them

271
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:57,284
if we pull them out.

272
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,684
No, the other pair was also stuck

273
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:01,384
between some other rocks too.

274
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:02,941
Although we pulled both fins out,

275
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:04,943
nothing was found on either one of them.

276
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,484
Talking about writing...

277
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:10,484
Something was written on the rock that was near the fin, wasn't there?

278
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:13,584
Yes. The names of fish.

279
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,784
Four names, I think it was.

280
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,484
The names of fish?

281
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:18,957
Yes.

282
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,984
If I'm not mistaken, Mackerel.

283
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:22,961
"Mackerel"

284
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:23,784
Carp.

285
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:24,963
"Carp"

286
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,084
Sea Bream.

287
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,584
"Sea Bream"

288
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,584
Flatfish. I think it was.

289
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:31,584
"Flatfish"

290
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,584
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish"

291
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,584
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,977
All the more, maybe somebody who came to fish here

293
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,984
left those names back on the rock as a joke.

294
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:42,984
No way, Jugo.

295
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,684
Are you big brother Ida?

296
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:48,384
Mackerel, sea bream and flatfish maybe,

297
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,989
but you can't fish for carp at sea.

298
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:51,884
True.

299
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,284
Did you bring them here?

300
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,584
Yes.

301
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,684
Do you know each other?

302
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,384
We've been friends since childhood

303
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:05,784
when he said he wanted to become a good swimmer

304
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:07,984
and came here to the Ikkaku Rock on my father's boat.

305
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:11,584
Back then, he was so terrified and kept clinging onto me.

306
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,011
Talk about a nuisance.

307
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,013
Come to think of it,

308
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,084
what's with your older brother who came with you back then?

309
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:21,884
He was so scared that he didn't get off the boat at all.

310
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:25,684
Yes, that's why Sango still can't swim.

311
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:28,284
I guess minus blessings do exist.

312
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:33,031
But, what's with those writings, sea bream, flatfish and such?

313
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,033
I mean, it's not like we're at the Dragon Palace under the sea.

314
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,035
A dying message, maybe?

315
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:41,884
See, because look at this woman's left arm.

316
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:44,484
The part where her wristwatch used to be isn't tanned.

317
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:47,045
So, just to be sure,

318
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:51,384
before you came, I checked out the Ikkaku Rock area carefully

319
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,051
and found this.

320
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:57,384
A diver's wristwatch that matches the part where she isn't tanned.

321
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:58,384
What?

322
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:04,584
The edges are quite badly eroded.

323
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,884
I see.

324
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:10,184
If the eroded part and the letters of the fish match

325
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:15,073
it's a dying message that this woman left behind.

326
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,384
That's what you think.

327
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,384
Yes.

328
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:21,484
But the culprit stopped by here once, right?

329
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:24,184
It could be that, that person wrote it down

330
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:26,584
to frame someone else up?

331
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:29,784
If so, I think that he would've left her wristwatch

332
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:31,684
on for everyone to see.

333
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:34,684
But, she took it off and hid it.

334
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,084
In other words, she didn't want the culprit

335
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,384
who she thought would be coming back again,

336
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,584
to realize that she had left a dying message behind.

337
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:45,103
No matter if this Ikkaku Rock is a place where people rarely approach,

338
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:47,884
there's always the possibility that someone is watching.

339
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:52,284
She probably figured that the culprit couldn't stay here for very long

340
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,084
and hid her watch.

341
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:56,184
She left the dying message behind for the police

342
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,584
who she figured could check the place out good

343
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,884
after her body is found.

344
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:04,684
See, her initials are carved on the back of the wristwatch,

345
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,784
so even if some time passes before they find her,

346
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,884
they would still know who the watch belonged to.

347
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:11,884
It's true that there are initials H and A on the back but...

348
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:17,584
Akamine Angel... club?

349
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:21,139
The word angel is eroded and illegible.

350
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,684
Gee, sonny, like always your deduction is the tops.

351
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:30,484
He's just an I know I'm a great detective type kid's

352
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,784
that's been trained by that measly Kogoro.

353
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:35,484
From here, it's work for the police.

354
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,784
I'm sure that even a kid as bright as you

355
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:40,584
wouldn't know who or where this woman is from anyway.

356
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:46,884
She's the only daughter of President Akamine of a financial company

357
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,167
that has recently moved into Kanagawa.

358
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:52,084
Right, pops?

359
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:53,184
Yes.

360
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:58,884
She used to dive a lot around with here with some young men.

361
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:00,284
If I remember correctly...

362
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,684
Hikari?

363
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:12,684
Hey, doesn't that wet suit look like Hikari's?

364
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,193
Rather, who are they?

365
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,195
At any rate, anchor the boat near that rock.

366
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:19,984
If it's Hikari, we've got big trouble.

367
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:20,984
Yes.

368
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:24,484
What?

369
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:27,205
She's been missing for three days?

370
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,584
Is that true?

371
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:30,584
Yes. In the afternoon 3 days ago,

372
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:33,211
all four of us went diving together.

373
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,784
We were going dive again and go look for Hikari

374
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,484
because she didn't come back but...

375
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:39,217
"Rokusuke Oto (23)"

376
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:42,684
I got text mail from Hikari that said,

377
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:44,884
"I'll leave the rest up to you guys".

378
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:48,884
So, you all decided to come home

379
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,684
without even checking things out and looking for her first?

380
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,231
"Shuhei Aosato (25)" -It can't be helped,

381
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,184
because she did something like that before too.

382
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,584
Something like that?

383
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:00,984
Even when we went diving at the beginning of summer,

384
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,784
Hikari didn't come out.

385
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,784
So we all panicked back then and looked all over for her.

386
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,384
We even asked the police to search for her, right?

387
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:16,184
Yes. She eventually came back the next day.

388
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:17,584
We asked her what happened,

389
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,257
and she told us that a cruiser steered by a good looking man

390
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,784
happened to pass by and picked her up,

391
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:24,684
so she spent the night at his place.

392
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:28,184
I haven't heard of a search being set out for anybody

393
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:29,284
these two or three days though.

394
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:32,184
No, we haven't requested a search this time yet.

395
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:34,484
"Yasuji Kaida (24)" -Because she was really angry with us

396
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,084
last time we did so.

397
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,275
I sent you mail that said,

398
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,277
"I'll leave the rest up to you guys", didn't I?

399
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,279
So, don't make a big thing out of nothing!

400
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,584
So, you see.

401
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:47,285
That's why we waited without doing anything for a while.

402
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,884
I mean, after three days we still got no word from her,

403
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:53,884
so we came back looking for her and here we are.

404
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:56,984
All three of us took a dive

405
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:00,784
and checked near the point we went diving three days ago too.

406
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:04,684
We called out to every cruiser we ran into too.

407
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:07,305
We had no idea that she'd be found like this

408
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,307
at this Ikkaku Rock

409
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,384
where people don't usually even approach.

410
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:18,584
Ms. Hikari Akamine was left behind here at Ikkaku Rock...

411
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:22,084
and died from dehydration.

412
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,984
Who on earth could've done something like this?

413
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:29,684
And the names of the fish she carved on the rock

414
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:33,984
mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish.

415
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,684
What's implied in this message?

416
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,180
"Diver's watch".

418
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,228
All right I'm putting the mask on.

419
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,876
Masked Diver!

420
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:10,680
Not Yaiba, but diver.
