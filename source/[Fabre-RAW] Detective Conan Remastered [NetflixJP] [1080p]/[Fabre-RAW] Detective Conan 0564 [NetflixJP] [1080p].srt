1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:04,026
"Teito Bank"

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:06,926
Since Mitsuhiko wanted to deposit his New year's allowance,

3
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:10,026
we all kept him company and came to the Teito Bank.

4
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,626
However, Genta comes down with a stomachache

5
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:15,226
from eating too much rice cake.

6
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:17,126
While waiting for Doc and Haibara to come back

7
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:18,326
after buying stomachache medicine,

8
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:21,426
the rest of us take Genta to the men's room, but...

9
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:23,726
What's going on?

10
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,326
The bank was suddenly taken over

11
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:30,426
by men wearing masks.

12
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:34,326
FBI agent Jodie coincidentally happened to be among the people

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,626
who are taken hostage in the bank.

14
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:43,026
She succeeds in knocking down one of the robbers

15
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,126
after luring him into the restroom.

16
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,126
But she is stung with a stun gun by the robbers

17
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,626
and passes out.

18
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:52,126
We come to a point where we figure

19
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:53,626
that the only choice we have is

20
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,526
to beat the robbers up ourselves.

21
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:58,726
It seems that they still have something up their sleeves,

22
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,426
but we'll nab them for sure.

23
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:05,926
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

24
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:08,526
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

25
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,526
A vicious battle with bank robbers.

26
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:12,526
What are they really after?

27
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:14,126
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:16,026
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,326
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:04,961
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Silence"

31
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:26,461
This foreign lady sure was a fox.

32
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:29,261
We could kill her off now,

33
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:33,061
but we don't want the cops hearing the gun shot

34
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:34,461
and storming in here.

35
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:35,561
Okay.

36
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:39,661
Right...

37
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:43,561
I got the money ready.

38
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:45,761
So could you please open the case?

39
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:49,161
Hey... is that it?

40
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:53,161
I'll bet you have a lot more stashed in a larger safe?

41
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,261
If you like, I can blow this place up

42
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,061
using explosives, you know!

43
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:01,961
Just be quiet and do what's written on this paper.

44
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,861
If you make noise,

45
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,461
I'm going to bust through your head.

46
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,861
Okay!

47
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,961
All those with no friends or acquaintances here,

48
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,961
come here and cover your eyes and mouth with masking tape!

49
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,861
We'll tie both your hands for you, get that?

50
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,361
Oh, it's me.

51
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,861
How's it on that side?

52
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,261
What the... did you regain consciousness?

53
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,861
Yeah.

54
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:44,661
But, my head's still dizzy

55
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,061
and I don't think I can walk alone yet.

56
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,561
I wish give me a hand here.

57
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:52,261
Okay.

58
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,261
Hang on.

59
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,961
Huh? What's up?

60
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,761
That guy woke up.

61
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:00,261
I'm going to go get him,

62
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,961
so take care of things here, will you.

63
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,061
Hurry, we don't have much time.

64
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,061
Yeah.

65
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:10,261
"Restroom"

66
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,961
Hey... you're still passed out.

67
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,761
What was that phone call a while ago, then?

68
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:21,461
Maybe he called from dreamland?

69
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:25,261
To let you know that a bank robbery

70
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:26,961
is something really not worth doing.

71
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:28,061
You brat, where'd you...

72
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,961
Hey, hold it!

73
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,961
Hold it!

74
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,361
You'd better hold it!

75
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:40,961
Or I'm going to kill you!

76
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,761
How is it, Conan?

77
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,061
Yeah, he passed out from a concussion.

78
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,061
Let's tie him up while we can with the toilet hose.

79
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:58,361
We did it!

80
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:01,661
Project toilet paper worked out great!

81
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,261
It sure was worth laying toilet paper all over the floor!

82
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:06,861
The tranquilizer gun is the ace in the hole,

83
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,561
I've got to save it for later.

84
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,561
Conan, what next?

85
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:14,161
What else?

86
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:15,461
We're going to call the other men

87
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,161
using his cell phone.

88
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,861
Because the number which displayed in the call history

89
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,061
right before the call I made

90
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,461
is the number of the other guy.

91
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:27,961
Oh, it's me.

92
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,461
How're things on that side?

93
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,761
What do you mean how are things?

94
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:33,061
Didn't I just tell you on the phone a while ago

95
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:35,361
that I was going to the beauty shop?

96
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,561
Because we're dating tonight, right?

97
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,961
Right, see you later then.

98
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,161
This guy called his girlfriend

99
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:46,461
just before committing the crime.

100
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,161
Gotta find another one...

101
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:49,661
All the other numbers

102
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:54,461
are mostly of the guy who's passed out in the restroom.

103
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:56,761
Hey Conan, what's up?

104
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,661
You've got to hurry and call him out!

105
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,661
He was saying something about not having enough time too.

106
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:02,661
Time?

107
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,261
We don't have much time.

108
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:06,161
Let's take off his mask and jacket

109
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,061
and seat him on the toilet seat.

110
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,061
What time is he talking about?

111
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,961
Are they going to be picked up by somebody?

112
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,361
Besides...

113
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:18,561
They're separating the customers,

114
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,861
putting all the friends and acquaintances together.

115
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:22,661
And they made the branch manager put the cash in the trunk alone.

116
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:25,461
Why did they divide the customers?

117
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,461
Why did they make the branch manager

118
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:30,361
put the cash in the trunk alone?

119
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:33,961
In the first place, why isn't this guy wearing a mask?

120
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,961
If the police charge in here,

121
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:36,961
his face would readily be exposed...

122
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,661
Don't tell me...

123
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:47,461
I'm done.

124
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,761
I see.

125
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,761
Good work.

126
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,361
Talk about taking forever.

127
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,761
The guy who went to get the man

128
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:01,061
who passed out in the men's room.

129
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,761
Five minutes have already gone by.

130
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:06,361
Let him be, we don't have time.

131
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:11,861
We've got to start finishing up the job!

132
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:12,861
"Teito Bank"

133
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:24,261
Everything is prepared, sir.

134
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,161
We're ready to go in!

135
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,561
Anytime!

136
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,861
Okay!

137
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,561
The technical backup team and control team

138
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:35,161
be ready to take action anytime!

139
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,961
-Roger! -Did the robbers make any demands?

140
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,261
Nothing, yet.

141
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,661
We've been trying to call for some time now

142
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,261
to the telephone inside the bank,

143
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,261
but the line's been busy.

144
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,261
Busy?

145
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,161
I'm sure that the police outside are wondering about us,

146
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,861
because we haven't made any demands yet.

147
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:57,861
But why didn't you just pull out the telephone line?

148
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:01,461
It's better that way.

149
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,161
It's better to make them think

150
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,661
that we're calling somebody, somewhere

151
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,261
and making demands.

152
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:12,561
That way we can keep them hesitating to charge in.

153
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,661
The guy who went to pick the other guy up in the toilet

154
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:17,061
hasn't come back yet.

155
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:18,661
Maybe he went weak in the hips

156
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,861
and can't bring him back alone?

157
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,861
The guy who's passed out is pretty fat too.

158
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,361
No problem.

159
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,861
You were given orders to do things right

160
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:31,661
just in case something out of the ordinary happened too, weren't you?

161
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,161
Besides...

162
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,761
this peppy foreign lady

163
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:41,361
who knocked that guy out in the restroom...

164
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,361
also going to cross over to the other world soon anyway.

165
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,161
You figured it out?

166
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:52,761
You mean you figured out what the robbers are after?

167
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:53,761
Yeah.

168
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,361
These robbers are probably...

169
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,361
going to disguise themselves as the hostages here

170
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,661
and make it out of this bank.

171
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,661
Disguise themselves as the hostages?

172
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,461
But, how?

173
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:11,861
You saw the robbers all dressed alike, right?

174
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,561
Yes.

175
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,661
And the guy who stung Jodie

176
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:22,261
with the stun gun and made her faint.

177
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,261
They all had the same mask on

178
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,961
and wore the same jacket.

179
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,261
The guy who was passed out in the restroom

180
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,261
was stripped of his clothes and mask

181
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,961
by the other robbers, right?

182
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:37,361
And the guy who came to pick him up

183
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,361
removed his as well.

184
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:40,561
In other words,

185
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:42,361
they're choosing five hostages,

186
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:45,261
the same number to cover themselves,

187
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,161
and fainting them with their stun guns.

188
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,561
After that, the robbers dress the hostages

189
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:49,761
as if they were themselves,

190
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:53,661
they plan to make their escape.

191
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:56,761
But, won't they be found out immediately?

192
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,761
Nope.

193
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,961
Since both of Jodie's hands, her eyes and mouth

194
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,561
were tied and covered with masking tape,

195
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:06,461
I'm sure the same goes for the other hostages.

196
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,461
I see!

197
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,861
If they can't see,

198
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,261
they wouldn't know what the bad guys are doing.

199
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:12,261
Yeah.

200
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:14,461
And besides, the fact that the robbers

201
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,161
were separating the hostages into those who had friends with them

202
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,061
and those who came alone,

203
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,661
is only further proof of that.

204
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:23,261
If the robbers choose five people from the hostages who came alone

205
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:26,561
and dress them up like robbers,

206
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,061
when all is over and done,

207
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,561
even if the five perish, no one would say anything.

208
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,761
Perish after all is over and done?

209
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,261
Why?

210
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,361
Why do you think the robbers made the branch manager alone

211
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:42,861
gather all the money there is in this bank,

212
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:45,761
and put it in the case that they brought along?

213
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:49,661
Isn't it because he knows most about this bank?

214
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:52,961
In most branches of small banks like this,

215
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,261
a hundred million yen is left in a place

216
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:55,361
where the cash is easily accessible,

217
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,361
and 200 million yen in the ATM.

218
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,761
There is usually a total of 300 million yen in cash.

219
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,861
To collect all that and to stuff it in a case alone

220
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,961
requires quite a lot of time.

221
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,561
Then, why did they make him do it alone?

222
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,361
They had no intention to put it in the case to begin with.

223
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,761
The content of the case is probably...

224
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:15,161
a bomb.

225
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:20,561
A bomb...

226
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:31,203
"Teito Bank"

227
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:32,803
A bomb...

228
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,603
just what do you mean?

229
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:38,303
The case with bombs will be put behind the counter.

230
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:41,103
And after the robbers put five hostages,

231
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:43,603
branch manager and Jodie to sleep,

232
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:45,503
they'll scatter the money that the branch manager had taken out

233
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,103
and set off the bombs.

234
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,203
The only thing left after the explosion

235
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:50,503
are the seven dead people

236
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,203
and money that is scattered all over.

237
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,903
To the police who enter the scene after the explosion,

238
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:59,003
it would look like the robbers tried to open the safe using explosives,

239
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:00,803
but it accidentally went off.

240
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,403
And the robbers who were carrying the explosives

241
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:06,603
got the branch manager and Jodie involved and exploded to death.

242
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:10,103
It would look like the crime didn't work out as planned.

243
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,503
Which means that the robbers...

244
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:15,103
had no intention of stealing cash?

245
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:16,203
Wrong.

246
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:18,703
They probably made the branch manager deposit a large sum of money

247
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:22,103
into a certain bank account by internet,

248
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,803
and are planning to later forward it to their own account.

249
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,703
An account some place abroad

250
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,303
where Japan won't be able to touch.

251
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:31,403
An intellectual crime?

252
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:34,203
No, they're a bunch of super amateurs.

253
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,603
Even if a total of 300 million yen were to be wired

254
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:40,203
to a foreign country from this bank,

255
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:44,303
any amount of cash exceeding five million yen that isn't accounted

256
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,403
will be stopped by law

257
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:49,603
at the foreign exchange center.

258
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:52,803
Some time ago, it was different,

259
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:54,303
but since there have been a lot of swindling

260
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,903
and money laundering in recent years,

261
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:01,403
they probably planned robbing this bank sometime in the past,

262
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:03,303
because it took them quite a number of months

263
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:06,403
to get the members and weapons together.

264
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:09,903
Which means their plan was meant to fail to begin with?

265
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:12,003
They sure are stupid.

266
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,403
But, their guns are for real.

267
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,503
The explosion is probably also.

268
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:21,103
If we take them lightly,

269
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:24,303
we can't bust in there and nab them, you know.

270
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,803
Bust in there?

271
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,203
How?

272
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,603
Are you going to shoot them with that gun?

273
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,603
No, I'm just going to keep this for them.

274
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,203
I won't shoot.

275
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,303
Well, I guess when we bust in there,

276
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:37,603
we'll do it outright openly.

277
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:38,903
What...

278
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:42,203
There are still three robbers left, you know.

279
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,903
They'll shoot us.

280
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:45,703
Don't worry.

281
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,103
When that time comes,

282
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,403
they won't be able to see us.

283
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,103
That time?

284
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:55,903
I'm sure that they'll shout the following to the hostages.

285
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:59,703
Darn! Let's just blow up the entire safe!

286
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:01,203
Come on and help, you guys!

287
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,903
They're making their move.

288
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,503
Shout?

289
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,103
You mean like now?

290
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,503
Yeah.

291
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:13,403
Ayumi, you keep the door of the elevator open and wait.

292
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:16,203
Genta, take the cart that is left in front of the elevator

293
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:19,203
to the counter where the hostages are gathered.

294
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:22,103
Mitsuhiko and I will go there ahead of you.

295
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:23,103
All right.

296
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,303
You can count on me.

297
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,603
Listen. Work quickly without making a sound.

298
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:27,903
Quick...

299
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,703
Hey, Conan.

300
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,403
Are you sure it's going to work?

301
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:47,103
They're all hostages

302
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,703
and none of the robbers are here.

303
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:50,803
I see.

304
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:52,703
In order to make themselves look like hostages,

305
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:55,503
they have their eyes and mouth covered with masking tape too,

306
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,203
so they can't see us.

307
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:08,903
Here goes.

308
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,903
Just as I thought, a little more than two minutes to go before explosion.

309
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,703
That's more than enough time.

310
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:24,503
Hey, Conan, I brought the cart.

311
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,203
Put this on top.

312
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,103
Ayumi, wait outside.

313
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:51,903
There was a strange sound just now.

314
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:53,003
Confirm what is was on the double.

315
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:56,003
-Yes, sir. -Something must've happened.

316
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:04,403
We somehow made it in time.

317
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:07,403
We were lucky it didn't explode right away.

318
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,903
It wasn't luck.

319
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,103
If they're going to fake being hostage,

320
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:13,703
they'll have to cover their eyes and mouths

321
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:16,703
as well as tie their hands behind them.

322
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,503
The guy who yelled a while ago,

323
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:22,903
after doing so, had to use his mouth to tie both his hands,

324
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:25,503
then go over to where the hostages were.

325
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,803
Then after covering his eyes and mouth,

326
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:30,403
had to pull his wrists inside the two arms that are tied

327
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:32,403
and then pull his legs through,

328
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:36,003
so that both his arms would be behind him.

329
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,203
If they hadn't left plenty of time to do that,

330
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:39,503
they wouldn't be at ease.

331
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:42,703
They figured that three minutes was enough.

332
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:46,203
But, why did they use a time bomb?

333
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:47,503
If they used a remote controlled bomb,

334
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:50,703
they could make it explode when they want to.

335
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,803
But they can't throw the controller

336
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,903
to a far distance

337
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:56,903
with both hand tied behind them.

338
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,403
I see.

339
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:05,403
But, how are they going to find the culprits

340
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,803
from among these people?

341
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,303
It's easy.

342
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:12,503
All we got to do is use their voice and say this...

343
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:15,503
Okay! Everybody stand up

344
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:19,703
and slowly walk towards the direction of my voice!

345
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:22,103
Understand? Slowly now!

346
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,803
Don't trip over the person in front of you!

347
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,303
Hey...

348
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:28,503
How can you tell...

349
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,403
I was told of this.

350
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:43,903
Was something changed?

351
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:46,903
This must be a mistake.

352
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:50,203
So, you three are the culprits?

353
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,503
The robbers themselves are the only ones who won't move

354
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:56,203
because something that wasn't planned was voiced.

355
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:03,003
Okay! First remove the masking tape of the bank man,

356
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,503
have him open the door.

357
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,703
Yep...

358
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,703
When the riot police come in take these three

359
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,903
and the guy that's tied up in the corridor,

360
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,603
as well as the guy who's passed out in the restroom...

361
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,903
Just who is passed out?

362
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:17,903
Conan...

363
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:22,603
That foreign lady and this brat,

364
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:23,903
what're with them anyway?

365
00:19:23,903 --> 00:19:24,903
Shoots...

366
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:27,203
I guess the explosion a while ago woke him up.

367
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:29,303
Hey! You brats over there!

368
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:32,503
If you don't want me to break his neck,

369
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,403
go in the counter and bring the guns over!

370
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:38,003
I'm besieging this place.

371
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:41,403
I'm taking you to hell with me.

372
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:44,403
What's this?

373
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,103
You've already got it.

374
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:53,103
I guess you'll have to die.

375
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:15,103
Who is it? Who fired?

376
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,703
Is it Jodie?

377
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:29,703
The riot police heard the gun shot

378
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,503
and burst in.

379
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:35,303
The robbers were arrested in no time at all.

380
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:03,203
"Teito Bank" -I'm glad you're all okay.

381
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,503
Well, it's just natural outcome.

382
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:09,103
Conan and a FBI agent were there.

383
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:13,403
No. This time...

384
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:16,003
It's thanks to the Youth Detective Squad.

385
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,103
-Well... -We didn't do that much.

386
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:22,903
We sure did a lot.

387
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:26,303
It's been bothering me for a while.

388
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,603
Jodie, you're an English teacher, aren't you?

389
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:32,103
Since when did you become a FBI agent?

390
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,503
That...

391
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:39,703
Don't tell me that you're just acting like you're one?

392
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:43,403
Genta, you pretend to be Kamen Yaiba a lot, don't you?

393
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,103
Right, I'm just pretending.

394
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:48,603
I see!

395
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,803
What's the matter?

396
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,603
You don't look happy.

397
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,603
I was just wondering

398
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:56,803
who shot at the culprit towards the end.

399
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:00,903
Jodie was passed out.

400
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:03,403
Was there anybody there

401
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:04,803
who could shoot in the condition he was in?

402
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,803
Shu?

403
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,203
Didn't you see him?

404
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:13,903
He was among the hostages, wasn't he?

405
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:20,703
You had it tough, didn't you, Jodie?

406
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:22,303
We were at that liquor store till a while ago,

407
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:24,103
so we weren't aware of anything.

408
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,203
And? Who was there?

409
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:30,203
Well...

410
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:32,203
Shuichi Akai died, you know!

411
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,403
Don't ever say that name again!

412
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:37,103
Is anything the matter?

413
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,703
No, it's nothing.

414
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:46,103
Just forget what I said.

415
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,520
The title of the next episode is a bit strange.

416
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,500
You've gotta watch.
