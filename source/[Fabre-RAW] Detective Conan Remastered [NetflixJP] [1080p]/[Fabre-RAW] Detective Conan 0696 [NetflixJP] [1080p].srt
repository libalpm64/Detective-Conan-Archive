1
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:06,855
This way, this way!

2
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:09,155
We've got a grave case!

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:11,991
We need your help, Detective Mouri!

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,255
I mean,

5
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:16,755
why do I have to keep kids company from so early in the morning.

6
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,155
You're the one who accepted the request, didn't you, Dad?

7
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:24,003
I didn't know that Yoko was going to be on this morning's Wide Show!

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,355
Everybody's so energetic from morning.

9
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,007
You can say that again.

10
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,755
Aim for a 100% solution.

11
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,955
Clear all mysteries and codes.

12
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,655
In flower gardens usually seen at district centers.

13
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,655
A twisted trick of a person who plunges to death.

14
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,355
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,019
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:42,855
His name is Detective Conan.

17
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:30,129
"Flower Garden Vandalism Conspiracy"

18
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,750
Beikacho district center?

19
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,150
Yeah, it's a facility where the local people can enjoy sports

20
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,450
or spend their time freely doing what they want.

21
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,650
At any rate, I don't smell anything fishy here.

22
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,147
Over here!

23
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,850
"Children's Flowerbed"

24
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,153
Isn't this terrible?

25
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:58,150
It's all messed up like a whirlwind went by or something!

26
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,450
The children all take care of this flower garden

27
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,950
from giving water to growing the flowers and plants.

28
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,750
And yet now days every morning it's always messed up like this.

29
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,850
Talk about nasty!

30
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,173
So, Mr. Mouri, please catch the culprit.

31
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,550
Discuss it with your teacher or mother.

32
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,950
Dad!

33
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,181
So, I guess it's impossible to ask Detective Mouri

34
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,550
to handle this case after all.

35
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,650
And yet, when we called him a while ago, he said, "Leave it to me".

36
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,950
Right, Genta?

37
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,850
What's the matter?

38
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,450
Strange.

39
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,750
What's wrong?

40
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,550
The brick that I made is gone.

41
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,650
It was around here somewhere before.

42
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,650
Maybe the one who vandalized this garden,

43
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,203
carelessly stepped on it or something and cracked it?

44
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,750
Darn! What a rat!

45
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,850
Let's nab the one who's messing up the flower garden with our own hands!

46
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,650
Let's catch him!

47
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,750
Yes!

48
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,750
No, children can't possibly handle it alone.

49
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,050
The one who's messing up the flower garden is doing so at night,

50
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,750
so there has to be an adult around.

51
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,550
Come on, Dad! Promise made is to be kept!

52
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,150
So, here comes the great detective.

53
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,229
I'm in no mood to babysit.

54
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,050
You've all come?

55
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,250
Who's that beauty?

56
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,250
Good morning, Ms. Yamazaki and Saki!

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,243
"Toshiko Yamazaki (43), Town Centre Staff Member"

58
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:27,950
It sure is upsetting to see it messed up like this every morning.

59
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,050
Are you an employee at this center, Miss?

60
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,750
"Saki Okamura (24), Town Centre Staff Member" -Yes, and who are you?

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,257
Yes, I am the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

62
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,850
who has been asked to investigate the flower garden vandalism.

63
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,050
You're a detective?

64
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,050
Hey! Stop dilly-dallying

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,267
and hurry up and clean up!

66
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,350
Yes, ma'am!

67
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,050
If you will excuse me.

68
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,750
Thank you for your patronage.

69
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,550
Oh. You're doing it all wrong.

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,750
"Ryunosuke Okuda (57)" -When amateurs do the flower garden,

71
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,550
"Flower Shop Owner" -they really spoil it.

72
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,285
We did ask you to deliver things,

73
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,850
but we never asked you to put in your two cents!

74
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,250
I wish you would leave fixing the garden to we professionals.

75
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,550
I'll keep the price down.

76
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,550
Young plants, fertilizers and the manual labor

77
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,450
it takes for fixing up, everything included.

78
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,750
I said, we don't need your two cents talk.

79
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,850
I tell you, people are all only interested

80
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,305
in ripping money off from each other.

81
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,307
People are all?

82
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:32,050
Then, with discount and all, how's this?

83
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,315
I'm sorry, as you can see, Ms. Yamazaki isn't interested.

84
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,050
You stay out of it!

85
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,650
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

86
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,323
Shut up! This property was originally mine,

87
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,325
so it's up to me what I want to do with it!

88
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,950
Miss, are you all right?

89
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,650
Yes, I'm fine.

90
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,050
I, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

91
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,335
won't let anyone who gets violent

92
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,050
with beautiful ladies get away with it.

93
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,650
A detective?

94
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,350
So then, the one who's messing up the flower garden

95
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,750
does so between the time

96
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,050
after the employees leave at sundown and the following morning.

97
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,355
Since when has this started happening?

98
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,050
It's the 3rd day already.

99
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,350
I'm sorry, I'm so busy in the morning.

100
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,850
So, that's it for playing detective!

101
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,150
By the way,

102
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,150
do you know of anyone who may want to harass the district center?

103
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,150
Maybe just one.

104
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,373
Oh, you mean him?

105
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,250
Go! It's time for children to go to school!

106
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,381
"Workshop"

107
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,350
The brick of the flower garden. Did you make it here?

108
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,350
Yes. Each is of different size and shape

109
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,750
because the children all baked it themselves.

110
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,393
The one who's messing up the flower garden

111
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,850
is stomping all over the hearts of the children.

112
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,850
I'm sure that the culprit will come

113
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,399
and mess up the flower garden tonight again.

114
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,350
What happens three times will happen for the fourth time!

115
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,850
Let's go on night patrol with Mr. Mouri

116
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,407
and nab the culprit!

117
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,250
They're really all out to go for it.

118
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,250
I see, is that right?

119
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,450
Your parents run a cafe.

120
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,421
I pass by that area a lot too.

121
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,423
Please do stop by one day.

122
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,425
I can at least serve you beer.

123
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:27,650
Really?

124
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,429
Why should it be one day? I'll go tonight!

125
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,650
Tonight?

126
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,150
Geez, cut out the intimate act!

127
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,750
Uncle Kogoro.

128
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,950
We want to go on night patrol

129
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,850
to catch the one who's messing up the flower garden.

130
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,350
Is 20:00 okay?

131
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,050
Okay, okay.

132
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,050
You're really reliable, aren't you?

133
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,950
Yes, I am, as you can see.

134
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,250
I guess it's embedded in the character of a detective

135
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,550
to punish the strong and help the weak.

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,150
Come on, you people, I shall see you to school!

137
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,450
I'll be waiting for you tonight then.

138
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,750
That's right.

139
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,850
Wait a minute, Ayumi.

140
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,650
Here, it's for you.

141
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,750
It's what I promised to give you last time.

142
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,550
It blooms at night. I took it from my garden.

143
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,479
Wow, super. Thank you very much.

144
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,650
I've got one more, so here's one for you too.

145
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,650
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,491
Here's another serving.

147
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,650
Thank you, Saki.

148
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,850
Welcome.

149
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,250
My.

150
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,350
You're...

151
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,350
Since my mother's taking a trip now,

152
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,250
I'm part-timing here at night.

153
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,450
This is a nice shop.

154
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,750
It's your parent's home.

155
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,650
Yes, they live on the 2nd floor up.

156
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,250
Would you like something to drink?

157
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,250
Thank you, but I'm sorry, we just came to get Dad.

158
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,950
You promised Ayumi and the others at 20:00, don't you, Dad?

159
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,527
How can I go home without drinking Saki's beer!

160
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,250
He's not going to budge an inch.

161
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,450
I'm sorry, I made him drink so much.

162
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,650
Geez.

163
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,350
We're late because of Pops.

164
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,450
It's already 22:00. Maybe the culprit's left already.

165
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,850
I wonder if the children's flower garden is okay?

166
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,553
The flowers.

167
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,250
What's the matter?

168
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,850
She is employee, Ms. Yamazaki.

169
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,550
Ran, call the ambulance and the police!

170
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,050
Okay!

171
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,350
Conan, look at that.

172
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,850
This flower petal.

173
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,750
Pops! Somebody fled!

174
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,050
You're not getting away!

175
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,850
Caught him...

176
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,050
It's him!

177
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,250
He is from the flower shop!

178
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:35,796
The victim is an employee of the district center, Ms. Toshiko Yamazaki.

179
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:39,696
The estimated time of death is around 20:00.

180
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,396
Although she had bruises all over her body, the direct cause of death

181
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:47,096
seems to be the impact of hitting her head on the brick.

182
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:50,896
The wound on her head matched the brick that was beside her.

183
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,996
The brick is said to be one that the children baked on their own

184
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,996
and can only be found here.

185
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,396
The person who found the body was...

186
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:59,696
Children shouldn't be walking around so late at night like this.

187
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,896
We were going after the one who was messing up the flower garden!

188
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,643
Mr. Mouri, chaperoned us!

189
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,196
Okay, okay.

190
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:09,496
And, who is he?

191
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,196
He's Mr. Okuda who owns a flower shop nearby.

192
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:16,196
When the body was found, he was hiding, then fled,

193
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:18,657
so we nabbed him.

194
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:22,996
That man hates our district center.

195
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:23,996
You are?

196
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:26,665
A colleague of Ms. Yamazaki who passed away.

197
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:31,296
That man used to be a florist here until a year ago,

198
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,296
but he evicted when the district center was built.

199
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,996
He still has a grudge against that even now

200
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,996
and comes to mess the flower garden up every night.

201
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,679
Right. Since my shop was forced out of here,

202
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,496
my business stopped going well.

203
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,996
It's only natural that I get pissed, right?

204
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,996
I did mess the flower garden up.

205
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:53,096
But, when I came today, the flower garden was already a mess,

206
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:55,496
and that woman was lying on the ground.

207
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,696
Inspector!

208
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:01,296
From the circumstances, Ms. Yamazaki probably

209
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:05,096
fell from around there of the emergency stairs.

210
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,596
Yes. According to forensics,

211
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:10,196
on the 3rd floor landing of the emergency stairs

212
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,196
there were traces of struggle seen from the shoe prints

213
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:16,396
of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda's gardening boots.

214
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:18,296
I got it, Inspector.

215
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:20,719
In other words, at 20:00.

216
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,723
Mr. Okuda at that landing, got into an argument with Ms. Yamazaki

217
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,496
and after struggling with each other, pushed her off.

218
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,896
At that time, he was scared and fled,

219
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:33,096
but came back around 22:00 to check things out

220
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:36,735
and ran into us who came on night patrol.

221
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,796
No!

222
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:41,596
That's the only place in the center where smoking is allowed,

223
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,996
so I took a puff there when I arrived in the morning.

224
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,745
Then, that woman came to chase me out,

225
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,596
and we got into a small brawl.

226
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:52,496
And? How about 20:00?

227
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:55,996
Could you tell me where and what you were doing?

228
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:59,296
At that time, I went to deliver bouquets,

229
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,761
but maybe it was a prank. The address wasn't correct.

230
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,396
I was driving around the night road on my compact truck.

231
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:06,765
Was anybody with you

232
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,767
or can somebody verify that for you?

233
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:09,696
No.

234
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,771
I see, so you have no alibi.

235
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,496
At any rate, please come to the station.

236
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,496
Hey!

237
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,996
Yes, sir!

238
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:23,296
I didn't do anything. It's some kind of mistake!

239
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,783
But,

240
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:28,787
what on earth did Ms. Yamazaki come to do here at 8:00 at night?

241
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:33,196
I think Ms. Yamazaki came to look for this.

242
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,096
I'm in charge of accounting,

243
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,496
but the books didn't balance out lately.

244
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:40,096
It seems the operating fees are being embezzled.

245
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,196
Embezzled?

246
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,296
Yes.

247
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:45,096
Ms. Yamazaki is probably the one who embezzled he money.

248
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,805
I think she realized that I was checking into it

249
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,096
and came to the center at night to hide the evidence.

250
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,096
But, I hid the accounting books, so...

251
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:56,296
I see! So, she ran into Mr. Okuda then,

252
00:13:56,296 --> 00:14:00,096
and was pushed off from the emergency stairs, eh?

253
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:01,996
The story fits right in.

254
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:03,596
Just as expected of the famed detective.

255
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:05,196
What a wonderful deduction.

256
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:08,827
Well, I can do this hands down.

257
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:17,796
It seems you're not convinced about the suspect being arrested.

258
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,496
Look.

259
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,841
What's that line?

260
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,296
It looks like a string or something was dragged along.

261
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,896
Ms. Yamazaki's shoestring probably came off

262
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,396
when they got into a struggle.

263
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:32,296
But, isn't that strange?

264
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:36,496
Yeah. The shoestring of the corpse was tied nicely.

265
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:39,796
Which means...

266
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:44,863
Officer Takagi.

267
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:48,196
What about the flower petal that was on the clothes of the corpse?

268
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,196
You mean this?

269
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:52,396
She fell onto the flower garden after all, you see.

270
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:55,996
It's not strange that a flower petal would be found on her clothes but...

271
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,996
Have the forensic check it anyway!

272
00:14:57,996 --> 00:14:59,296
Yes, sir!

273
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:07,796
It seems that the flower petal is not from this flower garden, is it?

274
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:08,896
No.

275
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:12,891
And besides, the color was lighter than when it was first found.

276
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,893
Maybe?

277
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,596
Is this the bag you received today?

278
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,496
Right.

279
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:25,596
I see. So, that's the story!

280
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,996
But, I don't have the evidence necessary.

281
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,896
But, it's good that the culprit was arrested.

282
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,196
That's right.

283
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:34,913
Moreover, the flower garden won't be vandalized again.

284
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,915
It's not good at all!

285
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:41,196
It hasn't been solved where my brick disappeared to!

286
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:45,896
The evidence should most likely still be there.

287
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,937
Hiding evidence, eh?

288
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,396
So, you were the real culprit after all.

289
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,896
Well, I was almost deceived.

290
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:09,496
A corpse full of bruises.

291
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,896
The brick that was next to it.

292
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,896
No matter how you look at it,

293
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,896
Ms. Yamazaki looked to have fallen to her death

294
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,996
from the emergency stairs, you see.

295
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,796
On the landing of the stairs,

296
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:23,296
the shoeprints of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda were found.

297
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:26,965
The way it is, it could only look as if Mr. Okuda

298
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,396
who had a grudge against the district center

299
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:30,196
pushed Ms. Yamazaki to her death.

300
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:34,296
You tried to frame Mr. Okuda who had no alibi up as the culprit,

301
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,596
but made two small mistakes.

302
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:40,596
The first is the victim's shoelaces.

303
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:42,096
On the landing of the stairs,

304
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:44,496
other than the shoeprints of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda,

305
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:47,996
there were traces of a string being dragged.

306
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:50,989
Most likely, when the two got into a struggle,

307
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,996
Ms. Yamazaki's shoestring untied.

308
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:54,993
But,

309
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:59,296
The shoestring of the corpse that was lying in the flower garden was tied.

310
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:05,496
Which means that Ms. Yamazaki didn't fall then.

311
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:08,196
Ah, the flowers that are in bloom on the counter

312
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,296
and the yard are beautiful.

313
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:14,296
The flower that blooms so late at night, is it an evening primrose?

314
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,496
Even primroses are white when they bloom at sundown,

315
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:21,996
but are said to gradually turn pink deeper into the night it gets.

316
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:25,996
The evening primrose was the other mistake you made.

317
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,696
Evening primroses bloom only at night,

318
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:31,396
so they are not grown in the children's flower garden.

319
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,696
Despite, this,

320
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:35,996
the petal of this flower was found stuck to the back of the corpse.

321
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:46,296
The fragrance of the evening primrose lead me to you, the real culprit.

322
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,496
Isn't that right, Ms. Okamura?

323
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:51,996
I have no idea what you are talking about.

324
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:55,053
As for the shoestring maybe somebody tied it for her?

325
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:58,296
Evening primroses can be found anywhere too, can't they?

326
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:02,296
Even the police say that the culprit is that garden vandalist man.

327
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:07,065
Right, everyone knew that Mr. Okuda was the vandalist.

328
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,067
He was in need of money,

329
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,796
so messed up gardens in order to sell young plants or bulbs.

330
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:15,073
And was trying to get jobs to fix the gardens.

331
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:20,096
So you schemed to frame Mr. Okuda up.

332
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:23,696
You witnessed Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda fighting with each other

333
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:28,596
on the landing in the morning, and decided to create a crime scene there.

334
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:31,096
And in order to get rid of Mr. Okuda's alibi,

335
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:33,396
you put in an order giving him false address

336
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:35,696
to make a delivery at 20:00.

337
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,396
What do you think you're saying?

338
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:40,696
Ms. Yamazaki died at 20:00, right?

339
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:44,096
At that time, I was part-timing at this shop,

340
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:47,105
and didn't go out anywhere between the hours of 19:00 to 21:30.

341
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:50,396
You should know because you were with me right through.

342
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,111
It's true that it's more than 5 kilometers from this shop

343
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,696
to the district center.

344
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:58,296
And it would at least take 10 minutes even to go and come back by car.

345
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,796
That's an interesting deduction,

346
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:04,796
but the most important part seems to be missing.

347
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,696
When Ms. Yamazaki fell to her death,

348
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:09,896
I wasn't able to be there.

349
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:13,131
The key is the brick.

350
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:16,296
You took advantage of the vandalism case that started 3 days ago,

351
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:21,496
and started removing bricks from the garden without anyone noticing.

352
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:24,796
And you lined it out on the garden of this cafe.

353
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:32,796
Ms. Yamazaki was not killed at the district center,

354
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,153
but rather, in this yard.

355
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,896
So, your alibi is not valid anymore.

356
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:43,161
In other words, this was a trick to fake the site of the crime!

357
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,696
Before opening the shop, you called Ms. Yamazaki over here,

358
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:49,796
put her to sleep after making her sniff a drug upstairs

359
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:53,796
and worked from 19:00 to 21:30 at the cafe on the 1st floor

360
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,996
and established your alibi.

361
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,175
Part way through your part time work,

362
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,696
you left the shop for just 5 minutes around 20:00,

363
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,496
saying you had to use the restroom.

364
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:04,496
You put on the shoes of Ms. Yamazaki who was sleeping,

365
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,796
and pushed her off the 3rd floor window

366
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:10,696
onto the bricks that are lined out in the yard, and killed her.

367
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:11,896
At that time,

368
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:15,596
the petal of the evening primrose attached to the corpse's clothes.

369
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:19,197
After that, you hid the body into the trunk of your car,

370
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,996
and after closing the shop,

371
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:25,203
you carried the body to the district center by car.

372
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,296
In the morning after hearing the conversation between Ayumi and I,

373
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:31,209
you knew that we were going on night patrol.

374
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,496
So, you decided to go there before us, to set it up

375
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:35,596
so that we would be the first to discover the corpse.

376
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:39,217
You probably thought that you'd have an immovable alibi.

377
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,996
Listening to you talk for a while,

378
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:43,996
isn't everything you said till now a nothing more than your imagination?

379
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:46,696
Do you have proof that I'm the culprit?

380
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:49,227
The bricks that you took from the center

381
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,896
should still be in your yard.

382
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,496
Hey, Conan!

383
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,396
Yes!

384
00:20:56,396 --> 00:21:00,596
Oh! Just as you said, Pops, there are a lot of bricks!

385
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,796
After transporting the corpse,

386
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:05,696
you were called right away for interrogation,

387
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:09,696
so you wouldn't have had anytime to clean up your yard.

388
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,996
If we check the bricks,

389
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:16,596
a trace that Ms. Yamazaki was killed here should be detected.

390
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:21,596
This is just my deduction.

391
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:25,263
You're the one who embezzled the management money, no?

392
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,265
Ms. Yamazaki who started looking into the embezzlement

393
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,196
became a burden to you.

394
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:33,596
That's right. I was in debt

395
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,896
and although I part-timed at my mother's cafe at night,

396
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,596
I still couldn't pay up

397
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,896
and stole money from the center.

398
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:42,796
Yamazaki who realized this

399
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:46,296
threatened to fire me.

400
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:51,696
That's why I... That woman...

401
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,996
My brick! I'm glad it's okay!

402
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:23,381
The brick that Genta baked...

403
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:25,696
Where? Where? What kind is it?

404
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,396
This.

405
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:31,389
-What? -Don't tell me this is...

406
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:33,391
Oh, you got it?

407
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:36,296
Right! Eels over rice!

408
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:39,397
-Not again. -Again?

409
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:41,796
Your feeling for eels over rice

410
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,196
is strong as any brick could be.

411
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,954
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:50,940
"Step ladder"

413
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,360
Hey, wait up! I'm going to the next case!

414
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,720
Pops, you're too attracted to the title of next week's episode.
