00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,260
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,860
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,760
In today's episode, a car explodes.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,860
The adult world is a bit complicated.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,560
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,560
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,060
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,220
Thanks for waiting.

12
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,420
What're you looking at so intently?

13
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,620
I was just remembering the past.

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,620
The past?

15
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,820
You may not know,

16
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,020
but in the past, in every bank,

17
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,820
there was a space open for the general public.

18
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,720
They had a bulletin board with messages

19
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,320
such as "Looking for a nice home for kitten" or whatever.

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,820
I once put up a please hire tutor message on the board, too.

21
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,320
Were you tutoring, Pops?

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,220
Really? I didn't know at all.

23
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,620
Well, I didn't have money,

24
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,020
but I married your mother while I was still a student.

25
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,720
So I had no choice but to part-time to make a living.

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,320
You and Mom had quite a tough time, I see.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
But, the one who really had a tough time

28
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,620
must've been the one who was taught by Pops.

29
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,020
You can say that again.

30
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,920
What're you talking about? I was a pretty good tutor.

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,320
As proof of that, the student I taught for 3 years,

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
entered the law department of Jonan University.

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Oh, right. She used to live in Beika Town!

34
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Follow me. I'll introduce you to her, Megumi!

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
Megumi?

36
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,020
Hey, wait. What was that?

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,020
Is she a woman?

38
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,620
How nostalgic.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,920
I've never been in this part of Beika Town very much,

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,020
but it hasn't changed much.

41
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,120
Are you sure you haven't seen that person for a long time?

42
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,320
Yeah. Her name is Megumi Tanaka,

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,020
and her father is a lawyer.

44
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,520
He used to let me drink beer after lessons.

45
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,820
That's what kept you in one place for so long?

46
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,520
What's with that car?

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Hey, hey!

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,920
Watch out, Conan.

49
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,020
Gosh. What's with that car anyway?

50
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,620
Speeding like that on such a narrow road.

51
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,720
Her house is right around that tobacco shop!

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,620
Maybe the person called Megumi has gotten married long ago,

53
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,820
and doesn't live there anymore?

54
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,120
Could be,

55
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,520
but there's also a possibility that she's still single.

56
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,820
Dad.

57
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,320
I hope you're not thinking of anything funny.

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Come of it.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
What can I do with you kids along with me?

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,320
Oh, it's her!

61
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,820
Megumi!

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,020
Mr. Mouri?

63
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,820
Hi! You've really grown to be an adult, haven't you?

64
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,620
Wait, Mr. Mouri!

65
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,320
All right!

66
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,720
Okay, okay.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,420
Hiromi.

68
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,920
Megumi!

69
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
My little sister...

70
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
Hiromi is inside.

71
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
What? Hiromi is...

72
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,420
There it is. A fire extinguisher.

73
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,420
Give it to me.

74
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll handle this.

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,620
Hiromi.

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,720
Megumi.

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,120
"Beika Town Hospital"

78
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,720
I am sure you are in shock because it is right after the accident.

79
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,820
-But may I ask you a few questions? -Yes.

80
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,320
Your name is Mrs. Sakihara, is that right?

81
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,620
"Megumi Sakihara (35)" -Yes, that's right.

82
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,120
The person who died in the car that exploded is

83
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,920
Ms. Hiromi Tanaka, your younger sister?

84
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
"Hiromi Tanaka (32)"

85
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,420
Yes, that's right.

86
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,120
An explosive was rigged on to the car.

87
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,020
Explosives?

88
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,420
Just as I thought.

89
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,820
Yeah. It seems that the explosive was rigged

90
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,620
onto the underside of the car together with an ignition device.

91
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,220
It was probably rigged so that when the tires turned,

92
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,820
an explosion would occur.

93
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,320
Yes, I also remember that the car exploded

94
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,220
soon after she reversed.

95
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
Ms. Sakihara.

96
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,020
I know how you feel, but you've got to rest a bit more.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,920
That house you came out of is your parents' house, isn't it?

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Yes.

99
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,920
My parents died in a car accident 6 months ago.

100
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
What? You mean your father?

101
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,420
Yes, that's right.

102
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,020
My sister's been living there alone ever since.

103
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,820
Was that car was your sister's?

104
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
No, it was mine.

105
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,020
Yours?

106
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,320
What?

107
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,020
That's the car that I drove all the way here

108
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,020
from my residence in West Tama today.

109
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,620
My sister's car was at an auto shop for a safety check,

110
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,320
so I parked my car in the empty garage.

111
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,420
Since I'm not good at backing up,

112
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,620
my sister was getting the car out for me, so I could head on home.

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,220
My sister...

114
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,020
She offered to back it out for me.

115
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,420
Which means that you were the one

116
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,020
who was actually supposed to be driving that car?

117
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,120
Yes.

118
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Then, the killer mistakenly killed your younger sister?

119
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,520
I don't know!

120
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
I don't know what on earth is going on.

121
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,720
Megumi.

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,620
Megumi, about what time did you leave your residence in West Tama?

123
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,320
A little before 2 pm.

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,920
Did you notice anything abnormal about the car back then?

125
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,820
No.

126
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,620
What time did you arrive at your parents' house?

127
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,220
I think it was around 2:30 pm.

128
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,620
The explosion occurred at 3 pm sharp!

129
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,820
If so, then it is most likely that the explosive was rigged to the car

130
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,320
during the 30 minutes period.

131
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,220
Do you have any idea as to who it may be?

132
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,720
Do you know if anyone may have a grudge against you?

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,120
No. But...

134
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,870
But?

135
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,270
About a week ago,

136
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,070
I was being watched

137
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,770
by a male stranger at a supermarket near my house.

138
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,220
A male stranger?

139
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,320
Yes. I pretended not to notice,

140
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
but I felt quite uncomfortable.

141
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
Do you remember that man's face?

142
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,020
Yes. He had a very characteristic face.

143
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,420
We'll get an officer who is good at drawing portraits,

144
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,620
so we'd like your cooperation.

145
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Megumi.

146
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,820
It didn't even occur to me that I'd be meeting you again like this.

147
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,820
I knew that you had become a famous detective, Mr. Mouri.

148
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,320
I used to always boast to my friends that you used to be my tutor.

149
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,920
I see.

150
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,720
I will surely track down the killer

151
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
who did such a terrible thing to Hiromi!

152
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,620
Please do that, Mr. Mouri.

153
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,420
Leave it to me!

154
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,120
What a surprise that she used to be a student of yours.

155
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
You also knew her younger sister too, then, didn't you?

156
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,320
Yes.

157
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,620
She was still in junior high school back then

158
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,220
and used to always serve us cake and tea.

159
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,520
Unlike her older sister, Megumi, who was quiet and easy-going,

160
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,820
Hiromi used to joke a lot, had many friends,

161
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,320
was outgoing,

162
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,820
and was very cheerful.

163
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,920
They don't seem to have changed much to this day.

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,520
After Ms. Megumi graduated from college,

165
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,720
she went to work for a securities company.

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,520
She stayed there only for a short while and got married.

167
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,920
She has no children,

168
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,720
but seems to be living a peaceful life as a housewife.

169
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,320
On the contrary, after Ms. Hiromi graduated from a two-year college,

170
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
worked as a free part-timer,

171
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,420
and even after reaching the age of 30,

172
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,920
still seemed to be living a carefree life.

173
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,420
It seems the investigation on Hiromi's going to take some time.

174
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,820
Inspector Megure.

175
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,020
The portrait is done.

176
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,920
Thank you.

177
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,020
Let me see, too.

178
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,620
He's...

179
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,520
Doesn't he look like that man?

180
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,320
Remember the driver who overtook us on our way to Megumi's house.

181
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,920
Although he was wearing sunglasses,

182
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,720
his hairstyle and chin look exactly the same.

183
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,120
Come to think of it...

184
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,920
He looks just like the man!

185
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
About what time did you see him?

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,220
About 10 minutes before we got to Megumi's house

187
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,620
at the alley about 500 meters before reaching her house.

188
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,620
Which means he could've been fleeing after setting up the explosive.

189
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,920
Do you remember the model and license number of the car?

190
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
Well...

191
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
It was a red RV, with a Shinjuku license number.

192
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,320
All right. Let's search for it immediately.

193
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,520
Excuse me, how is Megumi? She is my wife.

194
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,220
How is she?

195
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,320
Excuse me, but are you Mr. Kazuo Sakihara?

196
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
"Azuo Sakihara (37)" -Yes.

197
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,220
I got a call from the police saying that my wife had a bombing accident.

198
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,020
And, how is she?

199
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,120
Please don't worry, she's fine.

200
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,020
But, your wife's younger sister passed away.

201
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,920
Hiromi?

202
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,820
Oh, I mean...

203
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,120
Why her?

204
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,520
An explosive was rigged to your wife's car

205
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,020
but Ms. Hiromi was driving the car in her place.

206
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,420
Mr. Sakihara, have you ever seen anyone like this before?

207
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,420
I see. So you have, haven't you?

208
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,720
No, never.

209
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,320
Excuse me.

210
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,820
He sure is acting strange.

211
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,920
Inspector Megure!

212
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Investigation at the scene of the explosion has been completed.

213
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,720
How was the portrait?

214
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,020
Here it is.

215
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,720
Mouri and the others seem to have seen him

216
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,820
near the scene of the explosion.

217
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,920
That's reliable evidence.

218
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,020
This man...

219
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,820
What's up, Officer Takagi?

220
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,620
Well, I thought I saw him

221
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,420
among the papers of the case that Officer Sato is handling.

222
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
What?

223
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,720
You mean the one who was killed in Shinjuku?

224
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
Yes, I only took a glimpse,

225
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,720
but he looks a lot like the victim's husband.

226
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,220
All right. Check on that portrait right away

227
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,120
and contact Officer Sato.

228
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Yes, sir.

229
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,210
"Police Station"

230
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,610
Yes, they do look alike.

231
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,010
I've met the man himself,

232
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,310
so I think there is no mistake about it.

233
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,510
He's the husband of the woman who was stabbed to death on her way back

234
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,710
after shopping at a convenience store at night.

235
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,910
"Hiromasa Takahashi (33)" -He is Hiromasa Takahashi,

236
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,110
age 33, an employee at a chemicals company.

237
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,610
And over here is his wife, the victim,

238
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,110
Mrs. Sachiko Takahashi, age 27.

239
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,010
We're investigating a random murder.

240
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,510
She was covered by a very expensive insurance policy.

241
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,710
Her husband who is in debt was also a suspect.

242
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,810
However, he had a perfect alibi.

243
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,910
I see.

244
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,310
Is Takahashi's car a red RV with a Shinjuku license plate number?

245
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,010
Yes. Exactly.

246
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,310
What?

247
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,510
Now, it is quite definite that the man we saw was Takahashi.

248
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,310
And if he works for a chemicals company,

249
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,910
he could easily get a hold of explosives, too.

250
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,110
A random murder case and a bombing incident,

251
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,410
looks to be two very different cases,

252
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,410
but I wonder if there is any connection?

253
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,910
Although there are no names that correlate in both cases.

254
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,510
But, too many things fit in for this to be a coincidence.

255
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,910
Another deduction could be...

256
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,310
Officer Takagi,

257
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,810
you've got a cool looking badge there!

258
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,710
Please exchange it with mine.

259
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,910
No, Conan, this is not a badge.

260
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,910
Please exchange it with me.

261
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,710
-Exchange it with me, please. -Conan!

262
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,010
Hey! Don't you understand that you can't exchange it?

263
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,910
Exchange?

264
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,310
I've figured it out, inspector.

265
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,510
This is an exchange murder.

266
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,410
Exchange murder?

267
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,110
Yes.

268
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,310
If so, both incidents connect.

269
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,310
Do you mean...

270
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,510
that an agreement of an exchange murder

271
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,310
was made between Kazuo Sakihara and Hiromasa Takahashi.

272
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,410
First, Sakihara kills Takahashi's wife, Sachiko.

273
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,410
Next, Takahashi kills Sakihara's wife, Megumi.

274
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,310
I see.

275
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,410
When Sakihara saw the sketch of Takahashi at the hospital,

276
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,310
he looked out rightly shocked.

277
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,910
That's because he knew that Mr. Takahashi was the killer.

278
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,910
But, why did Mr. Sakihara want to kill his wife?

279
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,910
That can be imagined from his remark when he found out

280
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,910
that the one who died was his wife's younger sister.

281
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,310
Hiromi?

282
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,310
He's remark sounded obviously more intimate

283
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,110
than just a brother-in-law relationship with her.

284
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,510
All right.

285
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,310
Let's investigate the case with all that was pointed out just now.

286
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,610
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

287
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,310
Mr. Takahashi?

288
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,710
You seem to be in a rush, but are you going anywhere?

289
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,210
Darn!

290
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,410
Freeze!

291
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,610
You're arrested on charges of assault and battery!

292
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,510
Darn!

293
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,810
There is a bomb in the bag.

294
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,210
What?

295
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,010
We did it, Officer Takagi!

296
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,110
Indeed.

297
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,410
"A few days later" -After Sakihara saw the sketch,

298
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,810
he informed Takahashi to run for it.

299
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,010
But, that in turn, was a breakthrough for us.

300
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,610
After Sakihara hearing that Takahashi had admitted the crime,

301
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,810
also resigned and confessed that he had killed Takahashi's wife.

302
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,110
He seems to have talked Takahashi into committing an exchange murder

303
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,310
when they happened to see each other at a bar.

304
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,510
They never met after that first meeting,

305
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,910
all arrangements were done by phone.

306
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,910
They used the payphone so that no proof would be left.

307
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,010
Sakihara had a phone exclusively for himself in his study upstairs

308
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,710
and took all his calls with that phone.

309
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,710
That's why Megumi didn't realize what was going on.

310
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,010
And, what was Sakihara's motive?

311
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,510
Just as you had deduced,

312
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,410
Sakihara had an intimate relationship

313
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,210
with Megumi's younger sister, Hiromi.

314
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,910
Sakihara seems to have thought up killing Megumi,

315
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,610
in order to come up with cash for opening a boutique

316
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,710
that Hiromi said she wanted to start.

317
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,110
Because if Megumi dies,

318
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,910
all the money that he inherits from her,

319
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,510
and the money for the insurance that she is covered by

320
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,410
would become his.

321
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,410
How cruel. Poor Megumi.

322
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,110
Does Megumi know about this?

323
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,010
Yes. Although it seems she couldn't make herself believe it at first,

324
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,110
all she could do after finding it to be true was cry.

325
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,410
It's understandable,

326
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,910
because although she wasn't involved in the crime at all,

327
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,510
she was backstabbed by her younger sister.

328
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,510
I'll go and look in on her in a few days.

329
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,910
That's a good idea.

330
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,510
So, the case has been solved and is closed.

331
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,910
Help her out like an old friend, will you?

332
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,310
Yes, sure thing.

333
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,610
I'll see you, then, Ran.

334
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,010
Goodbye, Inspector Megure.

335
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,010
I wonder if everything has really been solved?

336
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,810
I have a feeling

337
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,610
that something is being overlooked.

338
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,110
"A few days later" -Dad!

339
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:28,310
Dad, you promised to meet Megumi at 1 pm, didn't you?

340
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,110
Look. We're an hour early.

341
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,910
Let's go have some coffee.

342
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,510
Isn't this the supermarket where Megumi mentioned she saw Takahashi?

343
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,810
Conan.

344
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,110
Hurry, come.

345
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,210
Okay.

346
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,910
Dad, isn't that Megumi?

347
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,110
What? Megumi?

348
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,010
Hey, Megumi!

349
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,410
Hey!

350
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,710
She's gone.

351
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,210
Conan?

352
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,610
She reversed out...

353
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,410
of such a narrow parking space.

354
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,010
Didn't she mentioned...

355
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,210
Since I'm not good at backing up,

356
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,910
my sister was getting the car out for me, so I could head on home.

357
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,610
My sister...

358
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,710
She offered to back it out for me.

359
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,910
But, what I saw,

360
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,910
doesn't look like a person who has trouble backing up the car.

361
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,710
Then why did Megumi ask Hiromi for substitution?

362
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,010
Because of that, the explosion killed Hiromi.

363
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,310
Can this really be an unlucky coincidence?

364
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,110
Maybe...

365
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,110
What if maybe Megumi already knew everything?

366
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,310
This case has not yet ended.
