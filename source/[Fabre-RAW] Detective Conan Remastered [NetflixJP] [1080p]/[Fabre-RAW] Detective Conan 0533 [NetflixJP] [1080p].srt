1
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:03,983
The boy that Ms. Kurumi Shodo

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:07,987
"Kurumi Shodo (39)" -befriended at the beach 30 years ago,

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,839
saved her life from a traffic accident,

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,639
she owed her life to him.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,339
Kurumi says that the lottery ticket she happened to buy

6
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,139
was a winning ticket for 1 billion yen

7
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:19,239
and she wants to give it to the boy who saved her.

8
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:22,001
So, she contacted TV stations and magazines.

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,139
The clues are her memory of the summer days

10
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:27,439
and the large scar that the boy got

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,839
when he saved her from the accident.

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,439
Two men appear when she calls out for the boy.

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,015
Mr. Ryuhei Kusumoto has a large scar on his back

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,039
and Mr. Sogo Banba has a scar on his chest.

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,539
Both scars are large, extending in one straight line.

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,023
In order to discern which is the real man

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,839
we all go to visit the Shodo residence but,

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:51,239
there we find the officers of the First Investigation Division

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,639
secretly staking out in pursuit of a killer

20
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,839
whose time is about to expire.

21
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:58,739
That culprit also has a straight lined scar on his body.

22
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,041
However, we also find that

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,639
the butler at the Shodo residence,

24
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:06,339
Mr. Taisuke Hoya has a scar on his back.

25
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:10,049
Who on earth is the "boy of her memory"?

26
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,053
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

27
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,439
Saturday nights are for mystery.

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,439
With the deadline approaching, a first love comes to light.

29
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,939
The case of the scar takes an unexpected turn!

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,539
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,339
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,065
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,988
"The Scar that Invokes the Past"

34
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:16,175
No way.

35
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,988
The butler had a scar on his back too?

36
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:22,788
Yes. Although unlike Mr. Kusumoto and Banba's scar,

37
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:26,488
his scar was smaller that had only about 15 cm.

38
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:29,088
There's a chance that Hoya the butler,

39
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:32,488
may turn out to be the murderer too.

40
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:33,488
Why?

41
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:36,588
Isn't the scar on the murderer a big one too?

42
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,197
Well, when the Superintendent slashed

43
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,588
the killer and wounded him,

44
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,488
he was dazed out,

45
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,388
so it could be that he doesn't remember

46
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:47,588
the accurate length of the scar.

47
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,588
Besides, it seems as if that murderer

48
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:52,488
is very cautious too.

49
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:56,888
After that killer was slashed by the Superintendent,

50
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,888
he fled by car,

51
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,188
but when the car was found later,

52
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:05,388
no signs of his prints nor blood was detected at all.

53
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:08,988
The sheet covering the driver's seat was torn off,

54
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,888
so the killer probably wiped away his prints that were in the car

55
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:14,233
after tearing off the part where his blood stains were.

56
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:19,788
But, what makes you say that the butler may be the killer?

57
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,388
If the guy is cautious,

58
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:23,988
it's hard to believe that he would publicize himself,

59
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:27,088
even for the sake of receiving money.

60
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:30,249
After all, luminol reaction which usually detects

61
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:32,588
the traces of blood even after being wiped off,

62
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,688
wasn't detected.

63
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,257
The scars of the three men.

64
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,188
There's big one on Mr. Kusumoto's back

65
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:43,888
and Mr. Banba's chest.

66
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:46,788
On Mr. Hoya's back there is a small scar.

67
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,588
Mr. Kusumoto used to be thin when he was a child

68
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:53,588
and, Mr. Banba used to be a bookworm.

69
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,088
The boy in her memory

70
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,988
was knowledgeable of the sea and fish.

71
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:59,888
His favourite drink is ginger ale.

72
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:03,088
His favourite food are sushi and fried noodles.

73
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:05,588
He is a very honest person.

74
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:08,588
The nickname his classmates named him

75
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:09,888
was Gari.

76
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:12,988
Yes.

77
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:17,788
How is the investigation coming along?

78
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:20,988
Well... Nothing definite has come up yet.

79
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,301
I see.

80
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,188
Well, there's still more time.

81
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,888
A slight meal is ready, so you can eat if you like.

82
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:30,088
Light meal?

83
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:33,188
Let me guess, it's...

84
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:34,688
sushi?

85
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:37,788
Yes, amazing how you know.

86
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,788
Well, you see...

87
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:42,321
I've got a secret to tell you.

88
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:45,388
A little more below.

89
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,331
What're they talking about?

90
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,335
Will you please do so then?

91
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,288
Okay.

92
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,788
How surprising, though.

93
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:04,343
I thought that you were just a short high school boy

94
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:08,347
that still didn't go through a voice change.

95
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,888
But, you're still such a little boy.

96
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:15,888
It's as if Sherlock Holmes is pretending to be a child.

97
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,488
Really?

98
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:21,088
I can see what normal people can't.

99
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,488
I'll be waiting in my room, then.

100
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:27,888
I'll leave the rest up to you.

101
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,088
Mr. Detective.

102
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,888
Yes.

103
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,488
Super premium sushi for sure.

104
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:45,688
Why don't you have some too, butler?

105
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:49,088
Kurumi said for you to eat together with us.

106
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,389
Yes.

107
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:51,888
I guess so.

108
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:02,401
Natural stuff is good after all.

109
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,688
No, this is artificially bred fish.

110
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,188
Just what're you talking about.

111
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:08,188
This is natural stuff.

112
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,688
Right, Mr. Detective. Don't you think so too?

113
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,088
Oh, well...

114
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,988
I really can't tell myself...

115
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,417
Dad?

116
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,488
Natural or artificial, you say?

117
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:25,888
-Who cares? -Who cares?

118
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:27,788
It's pretty important, I'd say.

119
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:28,988
I see.

120
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:31,088
So, is it that you want to make an impression on me

121
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,188
that the boy she's looking for

122
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,388
is knowledgeable about the sea and fish and likes sushi.

123
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,437
Is that what you're trying to get me to see?

124
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,088
Oh, no.

125
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,688
Well, I guess it can't be helped

126
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:45,388
because 1 billion yen is hanging out there.

127
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:49,088
Talking of sushi, when that boy bought the pack of sushi,

128
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,988
what did the boy do after doing so?

129
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,988
The change was 100 yen more than what it was supposed to be,

130
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:55,388
so I went to return it.

131
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:59,288
I can't take what's not mine.

132
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,388
That's strange.

133
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,088
What is?

134
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:05,388
Well... the honest boy who said that

135
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:08,488
he can't accept what's not his

136
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,688
is obviously trying to take off with 1 billion yen

137
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,473
that should be going to someone else.

138
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:18,477
What're you talking about?

139
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,888
Kurumi is saying that she's going to give the 1 billion away

140
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:24,483
as a token of her appreciation to the person who risked his own life

141
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,588
to save her from a traffic accident.

142
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:30,488
What's wrong with accepting it?

143
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,888
You saw when taking a bath with me didn't you,

144
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,288
the scar from the accident back then.

145
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:38,497
No, the scar on my back

146
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,188
is indeed the scar I got during the accident.

147
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:46,188
True, you had a large scar about 30 cm long,

148
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:50,788
but that is again exactly what made me doubt you.

149
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:55,588
Kurumi answered the interview on TV, didn't she?

150
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:58,788
That the scar extended from one end to the other.

151
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,888
She doesn't remember if the scar was on the chest or back,

152
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,188
but it was a big scar.

153
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,523
She said she was sure of that.

154
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:08,088
Then, how old were you then?

155
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:11,288
Around 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary school.

156
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:14,533
Really? If the boy was in 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary,

157
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,888
a scar reaching from side to side would be about 15 cm...

158
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:21,088
Well. I guess...

159
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:24,088
When I first got the scar, it was about that long, but...

160
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:26,888
As I got older and my body got bigger,

161
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,188
my scar got bigger too.

162
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,551
Don't you know?

163
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,188
Scars don't get larger even if a person grows up.

164
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:38,088
-What? -What?

165
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,888
If you get a scar that's 15 cm,

166
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,488
the scar stays the same size until you die.

167
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:47,088
Well, I was pretty big for my age.

168
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,567
Me too.

169
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,288
Mr. Kusumoto.

170
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:54,888
Didn't you say that you were very thin when you were a child?

171
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,288
I did...

172
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:00,088
He probably said he was skinny

173
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,688
after hearing that the boy she's looking for

174
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,788
was nicknamed Gari.

175
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,188
He probably mistook it for "gari-gari" which means skinny.

176
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,288
He was actually nicknamed Gari

177
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:11,688
because he was a bookworm.

178
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:14,288
Gari because he was a bookworm?

179
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,688
Do you know?

180
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:20,599
When that boy ate fried noodles at the beach house,

181
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,888
he put a lot of red ginger on it.

182
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:25,588
What's that about?

183
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:27,988
I don't know about it.

184
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,609
It's only natural that you don't know about it.

185
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,888
I heard about it for the first time today too.

186
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,988
It's a trump card.

187
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:38,617
Don't you understand yet?

188
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:42,188
The boy liked ginger ale,

189
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,988
bought sushi packs often

190
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:48,088
and used to put a lot of red ginger on his fried noodles.

191
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:52,388
I see. That boy liked ginger.

192
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:55,088
There's ginger in ginger ale

193
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,088
and the ginger that comes with sushi

194
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:00,288
is ginger marinated in sugar and vinegar.

195
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,888
Which means that the reason

196
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,088
the boy got the nickname Gari was because...

197
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:04,643
Yes, that's right.

198
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:08,647
He was probably called Gari because he loved ginger.

199
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,288
That's right, isn't it?

200
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:12,651
You didn't even bother to eat the sushi

201
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,088
but went right for the ginger and ate it all up,

202
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,588
didn't you, Mr. Hoya?

203
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,659
No way.

204
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,661
You mean the real guy was here?

205
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:27,588
Yes. He has a scar about 15 cm on his back too.

206
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,088
So, there's probably no mistake about it.

207
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:32,671
Then, why doesn't he come right out and say so?

208
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,088
He could get a billion yen.

209
00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:39,388
I can't accept that money.

210
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:43,788
Because if I didn't tell her to stay,

211
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:47,788
she may have not gotten into the accident.

212
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:49,988
That's why I decided to watch over her

213
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:51,288
without revealing my identity.

214
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:53,088
But, it seems that you couldn't do so

215
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,488
without revealing your true identity.

216
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,288
Do you know why?

217
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,488
Kurumi who knew that you're the type

218
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:02,701
that would never accept what is not yours,

219
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,488
went on air and publicized

220
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:07,588
that she wanted to give you the billion yen?

221
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,709
It's because she wanted you,

222
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,688
who was right beside her to come out on your own.

223
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,488
And to tell you to not publicize something like that

224
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:18,717
because it may bring about imposters.

225
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:22,721
Then... Kurumi knew, after all.

226
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,988
Yes, she was aware

227
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:29,988
that Mr. Hoya was the boy she had known back then.

228
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:32,188
That's why she made him wash my back in the bath tub

229
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,733
where the air conditioner was out of order.

230
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,388
She didn't say anything about the red ginger till today.

231
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:40,739
She served sushi as a late-night meal.

232
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,988
She did all this to drop hints at me.

233
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:47,188
So, what now, Mr. Hoya?

234
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:50,288
Kurumi is waiting in her room.

235
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,588
But... Well...

236
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,288
I...

237
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:59,288
You'll be fine.

238
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:02,788
I'll go tell the lady for you in your place.

239
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:07,188
If you like, shall I go tell her for you?

240
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:09,388
I really don't want people who are just after the money

241
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,288
lying and saying that they are the ones

242
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,771
that she is looking for besides.

243
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,777
Okay. I'll go tell her myself.

244
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,388
He seems to have been urged to do what he has to do.

245
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:30,789
Yes.

246
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:37,088
Jeepers. I'd like to tell the truth if I could, but can't.

247
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,788
Just who are talking about?

248
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,088
Kamen Yaiba.

249
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,488
He can't afford to have people know his true identity.

250
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:48,588
Then, I guess I'll be going.

251
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,388
Bye.

252
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,488
Hold it, will you?

253
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:57,088
Police?

254
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,288
I... I was just joking.

255
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,088
I had a scar on my chest

256
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,821
that I got when I got hurt surfing, so...

257
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:05,388
No, the one that we want

258
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:08,088
is the guy with the large scar on his back.

259
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,388
You. That is.

260
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:12,388
Because after all,

261
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:16,088
that wound is the straight-line scar

262
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,988
what Superintendent Matsumoto left on the serial killer 20 years ago

263
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:22,588
when he cornered the culprit.

264
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:23,788
What?

265
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:28,188
Back then, I didn't know if the scar was on the chest or the back but...

266
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:30,849
it cleared after I got the mail from Mouri.

267
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,851
Mail?

268
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,088
Oh no.

269
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:36,588
I've got to return Pop's cell phone to him.

270
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,188
Normally, when people are wounded,

271
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:42,288
they reflexively cover that area with their hands.

272
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:45,988
So, the fact that there was no luminol reaction detected

273
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,867
on the steering wheel of the car that was abandoned

274
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,588
was because the killer couldn't reach his wound.

275
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:55,388
In other words, he was wounded on his back.

276
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,877
Tearing away the cover of the driver's seat

277
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:03,188
in order to hide the blood stains inside the car gave you away.

278
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:06,588
Oh, no... That's not it.

279
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:09,788
The scar on the back of a man I met before looked cool,

280
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:11,788
so I copied him and scarred my back.

281
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:14,388
You'd better cut out your wisecracks.

282
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,888
It's true, please believe me.

283
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:20,488
Was that man whistling?

284
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:21,988
How about it?

285
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,888
Yes.

286
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:25,388
If I remember correctly,

287
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:28,288
it was a tune that was popular about 20 years ago.

288
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:30,288
You're not lying, are you?

289
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:31,488
No.

290
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:33,988
Superintendent.

291
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:36,588
Popular 20 years ago.

292
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,488
That's the tune of the serial killer.

293
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,408
Ryuhei Kusumoto, age 42.

294
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,808
Around the time the incident occurred 15 years ago,

295
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:56,708
he seems to have been abroad home-staying.

296
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,708
This has been confirmed,

297
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,308
so I guess he could be cleared from the list of suspects.

298
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,408
I see.

299
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:06,108
He seems to have met the man with the scar on his back at a sauna

300
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:10,008
just before he left to go abroad to home-stay.

301
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:12,108
He seems to have had a towel over his head,

302
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:14,208
so didn't see the face of the man.

303
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,408
The man seems to have laughed and said,

304
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,957
"This scar was made on my back 5 years ago

305
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,408
by the police and is a crest of courage.

306
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:23,408
You want to have one like this too?"

307
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:24,963
Is anyone at that sauna?

308
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:28,967
Officer Sato and Takagi are staking out there right now.

309
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,808
Tell them to stay on their guard.

310
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:32,971
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,708
He's a vicious killer who killed a total of 3 people,

312
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,208
2 people 20 years ago and 1 person 15 years ago.

313
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,608
No, there's one more.

314
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,308
Did you forget?

315
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,708
I'd never forget

316
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,989
about Superintendent Morimura who died on duty

317
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,308
because of that incident.

318
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,408
After all, he's the one who taught me all I need to know

319
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:58,208
about being a police detective.

320
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,908
Superintendent Morimura.

321
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,508
After you died on duty,

322
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:11,908
you were specially promoted 2 ranks,

323
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:14,408
and I've finally caught up to your rank now.

324
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,408
But, I still don't understand

325
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:19,017
the meaning of the words you said back then.

326
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:24,208
Matsumoto, there's some meaning

327
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:28,208
behind the tune that... that guy is whistling.

328
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,029
I'm dead sure... there's something.

329
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:36,608
What on earth could there be, Morimura?

330
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,208
So there was nothing after all.

331
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,408
Nothing at all.

332
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,408
Well, it can't be helped.

333
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,808
It's an incident that happened 15 years ago.

334
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,045
I guess so.

335
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,047
The building itself seems to have been renovated,

336
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,008
and the people who come here seem to have changed too.

337
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,051
Come to think of it,

338
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,053
the sauna at 5-chome seems to have been greatly renovated

339
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,708
and has a good reputation.

340
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,708
That's right.

341
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,208
Why don't you invite Officer Chiba and go there with him?

342
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,408
I'll go, alone.

343
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,708
Did you ask me to come with you?

344
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,108
Of course!

345
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,108
Then, why don't we do this?

346
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,508
If we get to arrest this serial killer

347
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,508
before the expiration date,

348
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,108
let's go to a hot spring together.

349
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,308
But, we've only got three more days to go.

350
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,708
Take me to a hot spring.

351
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,908
You know what...

352
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:25,508
I wonder, is it okay?

353
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:29,908
For officers to be acting lovey-dovey on duty.

354
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,091
Oh, no. We're not acting lovey-dovey.

355
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,108
We're questioning the people around here...

356
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,808
Don't tell the children what you don't have to.

357
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,408
I know.

358
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:44,008
If I put together the details of the incident that was aired on TV

359
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:47,105
and what Superintendent Matsumoto said,

360
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,708
the first incident happened 20 years ago.

361
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,608
The victim was a doctor, aged 50,

362
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,708
called Mr. Tsuguharu Bokawa.

363
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,608
The murder weapon was the Japanese sword that he owned.

364
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,808
Two days later,

365
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,408
the professor of the science and technology department

366
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,808
of Tohto University, Mr. Atsunori Mugita, age 42,

367
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,008
was killed with the same Japanese sword.

368
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:10,808
When the officer who was asking questions in the area

369
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:13,808
about a car that was seen often and thought to be suspicious,

370
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,133
it fled and ran over the officer.

371
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:18,808
The officer as a result died on duty.

372
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,708
Superintendent Matsumoto who cornered the car

373
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,508
was attacked by the culprit

374
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,143
and was hurt in the left eye,

375
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:28,608
but despite being hurt grabbed the sword from the culprit

376
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:32,008
and slashed him leaving a straight-lined wound on his back.

377
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:34,108
And, five years later,

378
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:36,508
Lawyer Susumu Nabei, age 34,

379
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,608
was killed at his residence with a knife that was in his house.

380
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:42,908
First the victims were knocked out by a stun gun,

381
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:47,165
then viciously slashed using a Japanese sword or a knife.

382
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,808
In all three incidents

383
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:51,169
there were no signs of the door being forced open,

384
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,908
so investigation was carried out under the presumption

385
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,508
that it was committed by an acquaintance.

386
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:56,308
No common points what so ever were found among the three victims,

387
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:59,177
and the investigation was coming to a dead end.

388
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,708
Is that correct?

389
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,208
Yes.

390
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,508
But, I don't understand.

391
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:07,208
The first and second victims were killed with the same weapon

392
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,908
so it was probably the same killer.

393
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,208
Right.

394
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,008
A knife was used to commit the murder five years later.

395
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:16,608
How did you figure out it was the same culprit?

396
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:17,908
Well, that's...

397
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,197
That was because the letter

398
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,508
-that was on the victim's body was... -Hey, Officer Sato.

399
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:25,708
You're telling her about it too.

400
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,808
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,708
I can't seem to stop myself when they ask me questions.

402
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,208
-So, there are only three more days to go... -They're still broadcasting

403
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,508
-Do you think the police... -that incident now.

404
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,608
will be able to arrest the culprit, Mr. Hiramune?

405
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:41,219
Well, I think it's impossible judging from the present circumstance.

406
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,608
"Doji Hiramune (41)" -The culprit probably

407
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,308
has all the curtains closed,

408
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:45,708
and has all the telephone jacks pulled out

409
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,608
to keep out of contact from everything on the outside.

410
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,908
He's probably shivering in bed waiting

411
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:52,908
for the three days to go by.

412
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:56,008
He's probably trying with all his might

413
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,408
to keep a low profile and pass the time away.

414
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:01,808
If this isn't true, come to here to me.

415
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,508
That is, if you want to waste all the effort

416
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:08,208
you put into fleeing and hiding for 15 years.

417
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,008
I know that man.

418
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,008
He lives in the same condo as me.

419
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:14,608
Well, we're just about to go over

420
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,608
to your place to play.

421
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,608
We may just run into that man.

422
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:20,908
True.

423
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:26,608
Well, the serial killer may come along too?

424
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,808
No. I hope he doesn't.

425
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:31,269
Ai, you're frightening.

426
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:34,108
Be careful going home, okay?

427
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:37,275
If the killer comes make sure to contact us.

428
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,508
-Yes! -Yes!

429
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:44,108
A certain letter on the bodies of the victims?

430
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,308
Get a load of that.

431
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,308
There's good view of all the buildings in the distance too!

432
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:54,008
I'm sure the night view is also beautiful too.

433
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,293
I'm back!

434
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,708
I bought some juice.

435
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,808
We also got a lot of candy while we were at it.

436
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,008
"Masked Yaiba"

437
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,908
Did you get some Yaiba chocolate too?

438
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,008
Of course.

439
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,108
Come to think of it,

440
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:09,308
we passed a weird man by the entrance.

441
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,108
Weird man?

442
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:14,108
He was wearing a long coat that didn't seem to fit this season

443
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:16,108
and was whistling a tune.

444
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:18,908
What?

445
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:20,708
What kind of guy was he?

446
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,308
Did you see his face?

447
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,408
No. I couldn't because it was covered

448
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:25,808
with his hat, hair and mustache, but...

449
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:27,008
Listen, all of you.

450
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:30,008
Don't leave this room till I return.

451
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:33,331
Don't tell me that he was actually provoked

452
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,333
by Mr. Hiramune who appeared on TV a while ago,

453
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,335
and really decided to come?

454
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,108
The serial killer?

455
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,042
Next Conan's Hint:

456
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,220
"Z".

457
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,750
Ayumi, I'm with you!

458
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,427
Aren't you going to protect me?

459
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,020
Mitsuhiko, what're you going to do?
