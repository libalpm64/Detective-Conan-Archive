1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,160
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,060
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,160
This episode features Sonoko in her natural state.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Danger, romance and fate awaits.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,760
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,060
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,370
"Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story (Part 1)"

9
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,970
"Izu"

10
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,470
Perfect!

11
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,370
Sonoko, what in the world are you taking?

12
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
If it's a close up of your rear as you fixed your bathing suit,

13
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,870
a real close up!

14
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,270
It's eye catching!

15
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,570
Why did you take a shot like that?

16
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,270
It's obvious, isn't it?

17
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,770
When Shinichi gets back,

18
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,370
I'm going to show it to him!

19
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,870
What?

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,270
I'm sure he'll be thrilled!

21
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,370
You're nuts!

22
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,970
Shinichi would not be pleased by those pictures!

23
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,470
Conan, you agree with me don't you?

24
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,170
What?

25
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,270
Yes.

26
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,170
What does a kid know?

27
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,670
Good grief. I wish I were back to normal!

28
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,470
Sonoko, what's wrong with you?

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,970
You've been acting so mean lately!

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,470
Don't mind me.

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,670
I'm just jealous.

32
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,970
What? But, why?

33
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,870
Was it something I did?

34
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,770
Do you know why?

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,270
Do you know why we came here for these three days and two nights?

36
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,470
To look for guys, as always, that is your motive, isn't it, Sonoko?

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,570
That's right!

38
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,770
And this time, I've got my girl-next-door act perfect!

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,370
What?

40
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,170
What do you mean by that?

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,670
Whenever we travel,

42
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,670
we always stay at my family's vacation home or some fancy hotel.

43
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,170
"Gosh, The likes of her are beyond my reach!"

44
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,770
To relieve the fears of such men,

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,370
I deliberately picked this rundown inn for us this trip!

46
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,970
So that is what this is all about.

47
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,970
What a waste of energy.

48
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,170
And still...

49
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,570
Sonoko...

50
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,070
In the train coming over here,

51
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,770
at the fireworks display site near the inn last night,

52
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,470
and even here on the beach today...

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,070
All the guys that have come up to us,

54
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,370
every one of them were after you, Ran!

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,770
I don't think that's true...

56
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,570
Never mind, forget it!

57
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,870
I took some candid shots of you in your underwear.

58
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,770
I'll just show those to Shinichi too!

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,870
What?

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,270
Hold on!

61
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,970
Sonoko, wait!

62
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,170
I'll never forgive you if you do that!

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,870
I was just kidding...

64
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,470
I didn't take those pictures!

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,870
Sonoko, you little...

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,270
Good grief. She was lying.

67
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,070
Hey, ladies.

68
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,570
Are you free?

69
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,470
"Tadahiko Michiwaki" -How about having lunch with me?

70
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,170
Of course, it'll be my treat!

71
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,870
Yes! I'll be happy to...

72
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,670
I bet you're after Ran too. Aren't you?

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,170
-What? -Go ahead, take her!

74
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,670
She's at her prime!

75
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,770
Sonoko!

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,470
But don't try anything funny!

77
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,870
She's already got a boyfriend!

78
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,570
No. The one I was asking out...

79
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,170
was you.

80
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,570
You're kidding!

81
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,170
Isn't that great, Sonoko!

82
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,170
How exciting!

83
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,370
I don't believe it!

84
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,670
There is no way someone would pick Sonoko.

85
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,070
Something's fishy here.

86
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,170
There's got to be a catch somewhere!

87
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,970
But there is no sense worrying about it.

88
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,770
Shall we go?

89
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,070
I'll just stay here with Conan for a while longer.

90
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,070
"House of Sea"

91
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,370
So you're a student at Beika University!

92
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,070
Ran's father graduated from there!

93
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,370
Yes, that's right

94
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,670
I don't understand.

95
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,670
She always looking for guys

96
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,170
but when she's with one, she's so uptight.

97
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,370
So what brings you here to Izu?

98
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,770
I'm just getting over breaking up with my girlfriend.

99
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,470
She shattered my heart.

100
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,670
I felt so lost and was looking at the ocean.

101
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,670
Then I saw an angel.

102
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,170
If my instincts are correct,

103
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,870
you're going to turn out to be my savior.

104
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,770
Your savior...

105
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,370
Here's your beer! Sorry for keeping you waiting.

106
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,770
Thanks...

107
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,070
"Makoto Kyougoku" -Sir, please don't drop

108
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,970
your cigarette ashes on the floor!

109
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,770
It makes cleaning up harder!

110
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,870
Sure thing.

111
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,370
What a rude waiter.

112
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,870
Hey. Haven't we seen that waiter somewhere before?

113
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,670
Of course, we have.

114
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,670
His father owns the inn we're staying at!

115
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,770
I heard he comes back during the summer break to help out.

116
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,870
How do you know all this?

117
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,370
He was staring at us from the doorway

118
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,470
so I asked someone working at the inn!

119
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,870
Then I wonder why he's working here?

120
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,570
It's probably under the same management!

121
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,970
The Kawara Inn where we're staying...

122
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,470
So, you're staying at the Kawara Inn?

123
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,370
Yes, that's right.

124
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,970
Oh, my... That is so close to the hotel I'm staying at!

125
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,270
How about it then?

126
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,670
Why don't we all have dinner tonight

127
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,270
at that fancy restaurant on the beach,

128
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,970
I'll pick you up in my car!

129
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,170
Really? Are you sure?

130
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,470
On one condition, you bring your camera!

131
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,670
-What? -What? Why's that?

132
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,970
I just heard from one of the locals,

133
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,670
something happened on the beach close to the restaurant.

134
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,370
Like what?

135
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,070
Yes. It was almost a year ago to this date.

136
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,170
A young girl with long brown hair was murdered,

137
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,070
she'd been stabbed in the abdomen.

138
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,570
-Murdered? -Murdered?

139
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,870
Yes. It seems like she was attacked

140
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,470
while on her way to that restaurant

141
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,770
but there were no witnesses

142
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,370
and the case is still being investigated!

143
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,270
A year's gone by since the incident,

144
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,570
the customers have forgotten the incident

145
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,370
and business at the restaurant is booming, but...

146
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,670
There's one problem,

147
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,670
the girl seems to have taken a liking to the restaurant,

148
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,770
she still appears there even now.

149
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,970
She what?

150
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:09,370
Photos taken in the restaurant show her grotesque figure!

151
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,470
What a lie...

152
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,270
That's why I wanted to test the rumor

153
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,870
and see if such a picture'd turn out!

154
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,870
What do you think?

155
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,870
I still have about ten shots left...

156
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,070
No way! Don't you dare take your camera!

157
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,870
But if we showed it to Shinichi,

158
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,370
he could probably figure it out.

159
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,370
Besides, I'm going to show him

160
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,070
the other pictures I told you about are in this camera.

161
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,470
Listen to me!

162
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,070
That good will it does to show him pictures of someone unidentifiable!

163
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,570
With his deductive powers,

164
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,770
I'm sure he'll be able to figure out who it is in a snap.

165
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,870
Good grief!

166
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,570
Deductive powers?

167
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,070
This girl's boyfriend is a detective!

168
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,070
Oh, really?

169
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,670
By the way, what kind of photos are you talking about?

170
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,670
Wait until you hear...

171
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,070
Sonoko!

172
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,170
Here is your order! Fried noodles!

173
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,770
Customers are lining up so please eat fast!

174
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,770
That is it with that guy.

175
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,470
Does he have a grudge against us or something?

176
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,570
"Shoji Terabayashi"

177
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,670
Let's not go to that restaurant.

178
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,470
It's just too spooky.

179
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,170
Don't worry!

180
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,770
It's just a rumour.

181
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,870
Besides, a whole year's gone by since it happened!

182
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,970
If she did appear there as a ghost,

183
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,970
I'm sure she's grown tired of the place by now.

184
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,470
Hey, did you hear?

185
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,770
They found another one in the woods along the railroad tracks!

186
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,770
Another what?

187
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,270
A body!

188
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,270
Another girl with long brown hair's been murdered!

189
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,770
I'm going to have a look!

190
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,370
Conan, don't go!

191
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,970
Conan!

192
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,270
Good grief, he's so curious.

193
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,870
"Officer Yokomizo" -She's been stabbed in the abdomen.

194
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,170
Just like the victim last year.

195
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,870
Yes. This victim also seems to be a tourist.

196
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,570
By the way, what's the estimated time of death?

197
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,870
Let's see.

198
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,470
Sometime between 8 to 9 pm last night.

199
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,870
About the time the fireworks display ended.

200
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,870
What?

201
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,470
Isn't that about the time we passed here last night?

202
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,270
Yes, I think so.

203
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,770
That's scary.

204
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,170
Don't be silly. No one would attack you, Sonoko!

205
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,270
But look! I have brown hair too!

206
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,470
Can you guarantee I won't be the next victim?

207
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,370
I don't want to die in a place like this.

208
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,470
I haven't done any of the things I want to yet.

209
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,970
Sonoko.

210
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,570
Don't worry.

211
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,070
I'll protect you while we're here in Izu!

212
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,970
By the way, I think it'll be best to eat at a different restaurant.

213
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,870
You're right. And no cameras either!

214
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,770
I agree!

215
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,470
I'll pick you up at 7.

216
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,370
Wait for me in front of the inn!

217
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,870
Okay.

218
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,170
That man...

219
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,870
I'm sure he was at the beach side concession just now.

220
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,570
I'll see you later then.

221
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,970
All right! I'll be looking forward to tonight!

222
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,070
-Let's change and go back. -Okay.

223
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,070
Hey!

224
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,870
Why if it isn't Ran and Sonoko!

225
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,570
I didn't know you were in Izu.

226
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,470
Yes, we came to do some swimming.

227
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,470
So Detective Mouri is with you too?

228
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,470
No. Only the three of us came on this trip.

229
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,570
Three?

230
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,170
Hello.

231
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,470
So you're the one who is guarding these two ladies?

232
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,870
Stay on your toes.

233
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,470
Yes, sir!

234
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,570
And you two be careful too!

235
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,270
There has been a terrible crime.

236
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,170
Yes. We'll be careful.

237
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,370
I'll be going then!

238
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,770
Give Detective Mouri my regards.

239
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,970
I will!

240
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,970
He hasn't changed at all.

241
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,570
He's still energetic but somehow unreliable.

242
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,270
If your father were here,

243
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,870
he'd solve the crime in no time.

244
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,670
Trust me. Officer Yokomizo is more reliable than Pops Kogoro.

245
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,970
Oh, no! It's starting to rain!

246
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,470
I wish he'd come soon.

247
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,470
Patience, don't be so anxious!

248
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,670
Heroes always arrive late!

249
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,470
Stop that! You're embarrassing me.

250
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,870
What'd he put this umbrella here?

251
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,870
Does he mean we can use it?

252
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,370
Maybe he has a crush on you, Sonoko.

253
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,570
What?

254
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,170
Why, Sonoko... Aren't you the popular one!

255
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,770
For goodness sakes, he's so gloomy!

256
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,470
You're right. After all, you have Michiwaki, Sonoko!

257
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,470
Ran, stop. You're embarrassing me...

258
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,970
Oh, no! I left my purse in the room.

259
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,170
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

260
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,270
Okay.

261
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,570
What's the matter, Ran?

262
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,970
That guy wearing the glasses...

263
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,870
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.

264
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,770
Yes. Probably in this inn.

265
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,270
No. Not here.

266
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,570
Somewhere else...

267
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,270
Are you sure?

268
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,470
Yes...

269
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,970
Where?

270
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,570
Where did you see him, think, Ran!

271
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,870
Ran!

272
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,260
Sonoko, what's keeping you?

273
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Don't tell me you're changing your clothes...

274
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,060
Sonoko! What happened?

275
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,560
A man attacked and ran out through the window!

276
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,660
What?

277
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,960
Darn it! He got away.

278
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,060
I was so scared!

279
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,760
Why would someone attack you?

280
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,260
I don't know.

281
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,060
When I opened the door to this room,

282
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,160
that man was going through our things,

283
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,060
I was going to scream but he grabbed me!

284
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,160
Going through their things?

285
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,960
He probably wanted to steal our underwear!

286
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
The pervert!

287
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,860
What did he look like?

288
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,060
You saw his face, didn't you?

289
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,360
I didn't have a chance!

290
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,060
Besides, the room was dark

291
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,960
and I was so scared that I nearly fainted.

292
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,360
But, how'd you know it was a man, Sonoko?

293
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,060
While we were struggling, I bit him!

294
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,760
Right on his hairy upper arm!

295
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,160
Nice going...

296
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
What's going on?

297
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,060
What are you doing in the dark?

298
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,660
Michiwaki...

299
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,260
My car engine had problem on the way

300
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,660
so I ran over, sorry I'm late.

301
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,160
But how'd you know this was our room?

302
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,360
You weren't waiting at the entrance

303
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
so I asked the clerk.

304
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,560
His shirt's wet...

305
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,460
And his pants are splattered with dirt.

306
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,960
Could it be...

307
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,260
Michiwaki, can you take your shirt off?

308
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
What?

309
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,660
I want to see your upper arm.

310
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Conan.

311
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,460
I don't know what's going on

312
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,260
but is there something on my arm?

313
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Nothing?

314
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,060
There's no sign of Sonoko's bite.

315
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Satisfied now, kid?

316
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,460
Is something wrong here, folks?

317
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
He's bandaged.

318
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,960
That happened to your arm?

319
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,260
Oh, this. A guest got drunk and bit me the other night.

320
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
When was that?

321
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,160
Please answer me!

322
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,360
I don't think he's the one.

323
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,460
The man who attacked me was pretty hairy.

324
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,760
You were attacked?

325
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,460
Yes! A man came in through that window

326
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,360
and was searching through our things.

327
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,960
Sonoko just happened to come back to the room

328
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,660
and she was attacked!

329
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,860
But it seems he got away empty handed

330
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,460
because Conan and I arrived!

331
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,360
It was probably just a thief or something.

332
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,260
It happened once before.

333
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,460
It happened before?

334
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,860
Why didn't you warn us?

335
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,560
I did.

336
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,260
Didn't I tell you to secure the storm shutters.

337
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,860
Besides, it's quite late

338
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,360
and look how you're dressed.

339
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,660
Your belly button's showing.

340
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,860
Besides, you don't even look good in that...

341
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,060
How dare you!

342
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,360
This is my favorite outfit!

343
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960
Don't worry. You look good in anything.

344
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,360
Whether it's a yukata or a bathing suit.

345
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,060
What do you think you're doing?

346
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,460
I'm moving you into another room.

347
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,260
We have another room available.

348
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,960
But if you prefer to spend the night

349
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,760
in a room a stranger broke into,

350
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,960
that I'll be fine with me.

351
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,460
No...

352
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,960
And I suggest you forget about going out tonight,

353
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,060
have dinner in our dining room.

354
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,560
Your assailant may be waiting out there for you.

355
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,260
What do you think, Ran?

356
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,160
Let's have dinner here.

357
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,860
Hey, the food here is pretty good.

358
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,260
If we'd known before, we should've had dinner here last night.

359
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,760
If you had made reservations,

360
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,160
we could've prepared an even fancier seafood dinner for you.

361
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,060
Of course, this meal would be on the house.

362
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,360
But in exchange...

363
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,660
We'd appreciate you didn't go telling people that

364
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,860
a thief runs around our inn.

365
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,060
All right... I won't tell anyone!

366
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,660
That there's a knife wielding underwear thief in this place!

367
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,060
He had a knife?

368
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,360
What?

369
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,460
That's right!

370
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,360
Some might seeped in through the crack of the door

371
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,160
and I caught a glimpse of it.

372
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,760
The blade of the knife flashed!

373
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,460
Don't tell me it's the same guy who killed the girl they found in woods

374
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,560
near the railroad tracks this afternoon

375
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,060
and the girl with long brown hair was also found stabbed

376
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,260
in the abdomen here in Izu last year.

377
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,860
But if it is, why's he after Sonoko?

378
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,660
Because she has brown hair?

379
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,860
That's ridiculous!

380
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,160
Wait a minute.

381
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,360
The guy who attacked Sonoko

382
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,360
was going through the luggage!

383
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,060
What could have been in those bags

384
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,460
that had anything to do with the murder?

385
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,860
A camera!

386
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,260
Could there be a picture in it of the crime?

387
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,560
Sonoko!

388
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,060
Did the man who attacked you take your camera?

389
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,560
It was still in my bag!

390
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,660
But the back of the camera was open.

391
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Then did he get the film?

392
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,960
It wasn't there in the first place!

393
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,260
I took all 36 shots,

394
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,060
so this afternoon I brought it to be developed

395
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,660
so I could look at them during dinner tonight.

396
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,560
See! They've been developed!

397
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,860
Well then. May I have a look?

398
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,560
-Go ahead. -Wait a minute!

399
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,960
Don't worry!

400
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,660
I took your pictures out. It's with me.

401
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,960
Sonoko, you sneak! You made me scared!

402
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,860
Do you know these people?

403
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,960
You sure took a lot of pictures of couples.

404
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,060
She took those before she met you.

405
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,660
She was in a very foul mood.

406
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,160
She took those while making fun of them!

407
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,860
Ran...

408
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,360
That's strange.

409
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,560
Nothing looks out of the ordinary

410
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,960
and the victim's not in any of them either.

411
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,460
Besides...

412
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,060
Although we passed the spot where it happened last night,

413
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,860
Sonoko didn't take any pictures there.

414
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,760
So why did the killer think she took a picture that night

415
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,460
that would incriminate him?

416
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,860
I don't understand.

417
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,360
Something she said at the beach concession bothers me though.

418
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,060
With his deductive powers,

419
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,360
I'm sure he'll be able to figure out who it is in a snap.

420
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,160
"House of Sea" -If the killer was at the concession then,

421
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
But...

422
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,260
would that consent make him misunderstand?

423
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,660
Hey, ladies.

424
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,060
You said you were leaving tomorrow afternoon, didn't you?

425
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,260
Yes.

426
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,860
Then, shall we go to that haunted restaurant in the daytime?

427
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,360
-What? -Yes. Let's go!

428
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,760
It's not scary in the daytime!

429
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,560
All right, but no camera!

430
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,360
Yes, I know!

431
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,560
It might be my imagination but it feels like somebody is watching us.

432
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,660
And the guy in the glasses

433
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,160
that Ran says she saw somewhere bothers me too.

434
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,860
Then there's the man who attacked Sonoko.

435
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,160
Was he really just some small-time thief?
