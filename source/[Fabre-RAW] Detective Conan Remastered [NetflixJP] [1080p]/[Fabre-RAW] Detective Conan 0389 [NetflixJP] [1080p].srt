1
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,880
Deduction in Sakurajima!

2
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,780
Hand-made liquor brings about a sad result.

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,880
Pops is drunk but the case is solved!

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,280
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,080
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,280
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:01,735
We accompanied Pops and came to Kagoshima,

8
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:05,535
and visited the Takakuma Brewery, the maker of distilled spirits.

9
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,235
The crime occurred just as we were enjoying going sightseeing

10
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:14,235
guided by Fumiko, the wife of the president of the brewery.

11
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,335
The managing director Shinsuke Tatsumura

12
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:21,235
is taken away from his home by someone.

13
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,135
Two days later,

14
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,335
his dead body is found!

15
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,035
What? The killer is among us?

16
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:34,235
We can't find anybody who had a grudge against Mr. Tatsumura

17
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:37,635
other than the people of this brewery.

18
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:39,735
I'll bet Mrs. Shiraishi is in agony,

19
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,435
being that everyone close to her is being suspected.

20
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:47,135
But...

21
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:51,235
I'm sure the killer is among the people here.

22
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:59,435
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma (Part 2)"

23
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,735
How was it, after listening to each one's story?

24
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:08,235
Nothing gained.

25
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:11,235
Everyone has a motive and each person's alibi is not definite...

26
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:14,035
And yet, we don't have enough to go on to arrest anyone either.

27
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:16,535
Don't you? There are two things to go on...

28
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:19,935
Why did the killer go trough the trouble

29
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:23,035
of taking his corpse out of the house.

30
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,235
Moreover, why did the killer notify the police

31
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,335
of his whereabouts two days later?

32
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,935
If only both mysteries can be figured out...

33
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,435
Dad!

34
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:34,235
That's for being sassy saying something so obvious.

35
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,835
Why don't you hurry up and solve the mystery then?

36
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,135
Mr. Mouri, you're going to ask us questions again

37
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,435
"Satoshi Shiraishi (30)" -tomorrow, aren't you?

38
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:43,235
"Takakuma Brewery Owner" -Yes, from morning...

39
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:45,035
If it's okay with you, please spend the night at our home.

40
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,235
Ms. Maezono says she'll do so

41
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,235
because going back and forth is too much trouble.

42
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,535
That'll be a great help. I'd sure love to...

43
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:52,635
Okay.

44
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,635
He's not the killer.

45
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:58,035
If he were, he wouldn't let a detective spend the night at his house.

46
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,835
The ones who look most unsuspicious

47
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:01,935
are the ones who are most suspicious.

48
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,635
Talk about suspecting anything and everything.

49
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,535
This is no laughing matter,

50
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,435
I don't have the slightest idea either.

51
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,935
"Takakuma Brewery"

52
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,735
Two mysteries...

53
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:21,135
I'm sure there is an answer...

54
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,035
a reason why the killer had to do both.

55
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:27,935
Good morning!

56
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,335
Good morning.

57
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,435
It seems that everyone is already here and working.

58
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:36,935
I see. Making sake starts from early in the morning.

59
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,035
My husband gets up at 04:30 am

60
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:40,835
and goes into the storeroom at 05:00 am.

61
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:43,535
It sure is hard work.

62
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,235
Sake is a "living creature."

63
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,135
Once you start preparing it,

64
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:50,935
you cannot take your eyes off it.

65
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:52,435
"Fumiko Shiraishi (27)" -That's why you can't do something

66
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:55,135
"Satoshi's wife" -like leave the brewery to go kill someone.

67
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,835
You can't do something like that, can you?

68
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,635
I came to tell you that breakfast is ready.

69
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,435
-Thank you. -Thank you.

70
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,435
Anytime you're ready is fine.

71
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:07,935
"The workers who love sake making would never leave the brewery."

72
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,535
If that's true...

73
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:15,935
Dad, what're you laughing about?

74
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:19,035
I figured out the mystery, both of them.

75
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,935
Really?

76
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:24,335
The killer is Hitomi Maezono!

77
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,335
Why do you say it's her?

78
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:32,435
"Hitomi Maezono (25)" -Because she's the only woman among the suspects.

79
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,135
The first mystery,

80
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,835
why did she go through the trouble of carrying the corpse out of the house?

81
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:42,635
Mr. Tatsumura is has a stout physique,

82
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:46,835
so everybody would think that it is impossible for a woman to carry him.

83
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:48,035
That is, it would make people think

84
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,635
that a woman couldn't possibly be the killer.

85
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:52,935
It was a scheme to deceive others.

86
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,735
Then, what about the second mystery?

87
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,835
"Why did she notify the police of his whereabouts?"

88
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,335
Why else?

89
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,235
She wanted the dead to rest in peace as soon as possible.

90
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,835
Her kind womanly side took over.

91
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,835
Therefore, the killer is none other than and can only be Hitomi Maezono.

92
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:16,135
I wish Officer Shinfuku would hurry over here.

93
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:19,435
-I'll let him in on my perfect deduction... -But, Pops...

94
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:22,235
-What? -You said it's impossible for a woman to carry him,

95
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,735
and yet Ms. Maezono did so?

96
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,535
If it's impossible, I don't think she can.

97
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:34,635
Well, that's, you see, she may not look it but she's extremely strong.

98
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,335
I'm sure she's lifting weights or something.

99
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,635
Go take a peek in her room.

100
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:47,635
I'm sure she's got a super muscular body.

101
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:48,835
Don't worry, even if you take a peek,

102
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,735
since you're a child, she'll overlook it.

103
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,335
No darn way!

104
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,935
Help me out at work a little, kid!

105
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,435
Come on, how can you even think of making a child take a peek!

106
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:02,235
No, well, I'm talking in terms of pure detective work.

107
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:04,835
Give me a break.

108
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:07,635
"Seiichi Orita (60)" -No, it's not that I'm slacking off.

109
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,435
I'm taking a break, because we're changing shifts.

110
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:13,435
At this age we can't help but get exhausted.

111
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,835
How nostalgic thinking about times back then.

112
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:22,435
Is that you, sir?

113
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:24,235
20 years ago.

114
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,835
With Mr. Tatsumura,

115
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,335
and the person in the middle is the previous president,

116
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,235
who died last year.

117
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,335
And who are those children?

118
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,435
The current president.

119
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:35,835
He has a younger sister.

120
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:40,035
She's not his younger sister, but it's Fumiko, the president's wife.

121
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:41,835
They were childhood friends.

122
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:45,235
See, this guy next to me is her Dad.

123
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:48,235
We used to work here together.

124
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:57,635
The previous president only had one son.

125
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:01,635
So, he took care of her as if she were his own daughter.

126
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:06,635
Fumiko's father was also a very experienced worker

127
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:09,035
but poor thing, he died of an illness

128
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,135
soon after Fumiko entered junior high school.

129
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:17,235
But the previous president was not one to abandon the bereaved family.

130
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:20,535
He encouraged them and continued to help them out making a living.

131
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:23,035
He made sure Fumiko graduated from college.

132
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,735
He even helped her go through nursing school.

133
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:27,835
The previous president was a life-saver

134
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,535
for Fumiko and her mother, wasn't he?

135
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,235
Come to think of it...

136
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:38,135
Weren't you a nurse at the Chuo Hospital before?

137
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:41,035
Yes. I was, until 5 years ago when I got married.

138
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,335
She used to be a nurse before, right?

139
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:45,335
Yes. That's why she used her connections of the past

140
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:48,935
to get the managing director Tatsumura an appointment at Chuo Hospital.

141
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:50,135
An appointment?

142
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,635
For a physical exam.

143
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,935
He mentioned something like that the other day.

144
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,635
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

145
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:03,435
You see, the physical exam took longer than I expected...

146
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:05,935
If she knew the day before that something like that would happen to him,

147
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:08,835
I think Fumiko wouldn't have recommended him to get a physical.

148
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,135
You mean Mrs. Shiraishi is the one who recommended

149
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:12,435
the physical exam to Mr. Tatsumura?

150
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,135
There is a physical exam every year,

151
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:18,235
but the managing director never underwent one.

152
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:21,335
However, she kept insisting he get one because he was working too hard.

153
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:24,835
And, he was murdered the following day.

154
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:27,235
A physical exam?

155
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,335
Don't tell me that?

156
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,335
Is anything the matter?

157
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:31,335
No, not really.

158
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,635
Okay, I guess I'll go back to work then.

159
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:37,635
I need to get things done before the police come and questioning me again.

160
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:38,935
See you, sonny.

161
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,035
It's not impossible.

162
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,735
Rather, if that method was used,

163
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,435
the two mysteries will also be solved.

164
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:49,935
But, I have no proof.

165
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:53,335
Sakurajima.

166
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:55,135
If I remember correctly, back then...

167
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,135
That's right!

168
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,135
"Kagoshima North Police Station"

169
00:09:57,135 --> 00:09:58,435
Mr. Mouri.

170
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:01,235
I was just thinking of heading that way...

171
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,235
I have a favor to ask you before you do...

172
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:09,135
Yes, I would like you to check Mr. Tatsumura's corpse for me.

173
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,835
No, what I want to know is whether on the clothes he was wearing...

174
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:20,135
Come on, show your super muscle physique!

175
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,735
Just what do you think you're looking at?

176
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,635
Officer Shinfuku and the others have arrived!

177
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:24,635
Yes, ma'am!

178
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,135
Goodness.

179
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:29,835
Getting right to the point,

180
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,535
the stuff was not found on his clothes at all.

181
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:33,635
What's this about?

182
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,235
All right. This is it...

183
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:39,835
You know, what you asked us to do a while ago...

184
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:43,235
Oh, no, Dad. You mean you asked a favor and forgot what you asked?

185
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:48,635
Oh, that stuff. Oh, so nothing was on at all...

186
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,135
He's really good at playing along.

187
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:52,535
And, who is it?

188
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:53,835
Who is what?

189
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,835
Didn't you say that you knew on the phone?

190
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:59,035
And you said you would reveal who the perpetrator when we are here.

191
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,835
Who is the killer?

192
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,735
Did you really say something like that?

193
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,035
I feel like I sort of did.

194
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:07,235
You see, the killer is...

195
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,535
a woman.

196
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,935
-Hitomi Maezono. -Hitomi Maezono.

197
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,135
Dad!

198
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,135
My reason for coming to that conclusion is...

199
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:16,335
Pops, this is your chance to show everyone your real ability.

200
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:17,435
I guess so.

201
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:31,335
This Managing Director Tatsumura's homicide case...

202
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,735
Who is the killer?

203
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,335
The real killer is...

204
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,935
Sakurajima?

205
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,535
Is something wrong with the mountain?

206
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,135
No, nothing in particular.

207
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:53,935
Officer Shinfuku!

208
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:59,435
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

209
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,690
What is it, Conan?

210
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,390
He's gone. Conan?

211
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,490
He probably went outside thinking that Sakurajima erupted or something.

212
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,090
Mr. Orita, this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

213
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,390
Excuse me, I'd like to take a picture.

214
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,690
Quiet!

215
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,290
In preparation for killing Mr. Tatsumura,

216
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,790
the killer also schemed an alibi trick.

217
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,590
-Alibi trick? -Alibi trick?

218
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,190
I had an idea of what the trick is,

219
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,690
but I needed proof.

220
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,390
And that's why I asked you to do me that favor.

221
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,490
The "ashes" of Sakurajima, you mean?

222
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,790
Yes, if there was any found on the clothes Mr. Tatsumura was wearing...

223
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,490
There was none whatsoever on his clothes.

224
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,690
However, I already checked

225
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,890
with the Kagoshima District Weather Station a while ago

226
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,290
and found that on the day of the incident,

227
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,590
in the Kagoshima city area where Mr. Tatsumura's house is,

228
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,990
ashes were falling all the way through,

229
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,090
from around noon to midnight.

230
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,990
Doesn't something feel sandy?

231
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,090
Now that you mentioned it...

232
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,390
It's probably the ashes.

233
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,790
Yes, ashes were falling back then.

234
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,490
Isn't it odd?

235
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,290
We arrived at his house at 6:00 in the evening.

236
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:30,890
If Mr. Tatsumura was killed and carried out just about that time,

237
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,290
it's only natural that ashes would have been on his clothes too.

238
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,890
But, there were no ashes on his clothes at all.

239
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,190
In other words, Mr. Tatsumura did not leave home at 6:00 sundown,

240
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,090
but before the ashes came falling

241
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,690
that is some time in the morning.

242
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,090
I see.

243
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,990
No, but then...

244
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,890
Yes, there's a discrepancy.

245
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,790
It's blood.

246
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,190
I wonder what that blood stain was, Mrs. Shiraishi.

247
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,890
I was mistaken about one thing.

248
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,290
The reason you went out of your way, that day to take us sightseeing...

249
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,190
I thought it was because Mr. Tatsumura asked me

250
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,090
to pose for advertisement of your product...

251
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:33,590
Mr. Mouri, please refuse what Mr. Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday.

252
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,790
I thought that you showed us around

253
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,390
because you wanted me to refuse his offer.

254
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,690
It wasn't?

255
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,790
You did so to establish your alibi

256
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,290
and to set us up as witnesses to testify that Mr. Tatsumura was killed

257
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,490
just before we arrived at his house.

258
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,190
Am I not right,

259
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,390
Mrs. Shiraishi.

260
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,090
No way...

261
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,190
Mr. Mouri.

262
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,290
I said a while ago that the real killer is a woman.

263
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,090
-A woman... -You're referring to Ms. Maezono?

264
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,790
I'm talking about Mrs. Fumiko Shiraishi.

265
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,290
You offered from your side to take us sightseeing.

266
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,090
That morning you...

267
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,590
made up some excuse and summoned Mr. Tatsumura out to the park.

268
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,690
Mrs. Shiraishi.

269
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,890
Mrs. Shiraishi.

270
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,090
She probably said something like, "I'd like to talk to you,"

271
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,890
and made him get in the car once more

272
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,690
and put him to sleep...

273
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,490
Getting anesthesia ready

274
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,290
and getting blood samples were easy for you to do

275
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,390
for you were a nurse before.

276
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,390
Then, after that you came to pick us up at the hotel.

277
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,990
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

278
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,990
-Good morning. -Good morning.

279
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,390
Good morning.

280
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,090
You spent the whole day with us

281
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,390
and cleverly lead us to Mr. Tatsumura's house.

282
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,190
It's open.

283
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,190
I'll go check inside.

284
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,690
Mr. Tatsumura, this is Fumiko.

285
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,090
And, you carried out what you schemed in the living room...

286
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,990
Mr. Mouri!

287
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,990
Mrs. Shiraishi!

288
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,290
What's the matter?

289
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,790
Out of the two mysteries one of them,

290
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,590
why did the killer go out of the way to carry the corpse out, rather...

291
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,990
you didn't carry him out.

292
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,290
There was no corpse in that house to begin.

293
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,590
But the lights in the house were on, weren't they?

294
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,890
Before you came to pick us up,

295
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,190
you borrowed the keys from Mr. Tatsumura who was asleep

296
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,390
went into his house, turned on the lights

297
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,090
as well as unlock the front entrance door at that time.

298
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,190
So, that's the story...

299
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,490
Hold on a second!

300
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,090
Now for the second mystery...

301
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,790
Wait, Wait a minute, I said.

302
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,890
What you're saying is strange. It's totally strange.

303
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,490
You seem to want to insist that Fumiko is the killer,

304
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,490
but she was with you all day that day.

305
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,190
There's no way she could've done it.

306
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,790
When on earth could she have done it?

307
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,590
Right, Dad, when?

308
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,490
Right after the you know what, right Mrs. Shiraishi?

309
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,590
I'm sorry to have gotten you involved in something bothersome like this.

310
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,590
After you dropped us off at the hotel...

311
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,590
That's when.

312
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,990
You got a bronze statue

313
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,790
just like the one at Mr. Tatsumura's house beforehand.

314
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:29,890
In other words, this case occurred after the police began investigation.

315
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,190
It was a blind spot.

316
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,390
It can't be helped.

317
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,790
No one ordinarily checks for alibis after the investigation starts.

318
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,690
You tried to make us think that the estimated time of the murder

319
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,590
was just before we arrived at Mr. Tatsumura's residence.

320
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,990
Doing so would give you a perfect alibi.

321
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,690
Because after all you were with us right through.

322
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,990
The second mystery...

323
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,090
Why did the killer notify the police

324
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,190
of the whereabouts of the corpse two days later?

325
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,990
Two days having past,

326
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,890
it's hard to determine an accurate estimate,

327
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,890
but there seems to be no doubt that the time of death

328
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,090
is between sundown to night that day.

329
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,090
If the corpse was discovered immediately,

330
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,290
the estimated time of death would come out accurately.

331
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,590
On the other hand, if the corpse is left as is for many days,

332
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,490
it would be impossible to figure it out.

333
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,190
Either way, would make meaningless the alibi that is perfect.

334
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,890
That's why it was best for the corpse to be found two days later.

335
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,490
Mr. Mouri, when and how did you figure out I committed the murder?

336
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,990
On the day before the incident,

337
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,690
you recommended Mr. Tatsumura to go get a physical exam, didn't you?

338
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,190
That...

339
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,690
What do you mean?

340
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,690
If you take a blood sample, the trace of the needle would be left behind,

341
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,790
and that would bring about suspicion during the autopsy.

342
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,790
But, if he gets a physical the day before,

343
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,990
blood samples would naturally be taken.

344
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,690
In other words, she injected him in the exact same place

345
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,390
that he was injected the day before.

346
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,890
I see.

347
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,990
But, why...

348
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,690
Why did you kill Mr. Tatsumura?

349
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,990
I was scared.

350
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,890
I thought that if he kept on staying at this brewery,

351
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,190
one day someone would be influenced by him

352
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,090
and stop making sake the old way,

353
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,790
as a result dropping the quality of our sake.

354
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,690
That someone who was concerned only about making money

355
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,090
would one day come along.

356
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,490
No way, Mrs. Shiraishi.

357
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,290
Not among anyone of us, never!

358
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,790
Maybe now...

359
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,290
But, people change when various things happen.

360
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,990
Mr. Tatsumura... changed too, didn't he?

361
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,690
I'm to blame. I'm... to blame for all this...

362
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,990
I should've fired him.

363
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,790
Not being able to get rid of somebody who saved the brewery

364
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,090
is one of your good points. It's okay.

365
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,090
But, why... why did you...

366
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,090
I just wanted to look good.

367
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,790
I wanted to say, I'm the one who saved this brewery.

368
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,190
Of course she is not be forgiven for killing someone.

369
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:07,690
But, she did what she did wanting to repay your father for his kindness.

370
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,990
To father...

371
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,290
One who never forgets a kindness received.

372
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,890
Your wife is just like you, a woman of Satsuma for sure.

373
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,090
Fumiko.

374
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,790
Of course we're alike.

375
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,490
We're husband and wife.

376
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,890
Don't bother seeing me off.

377
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,390
You have to hurry back to the brewery.

378
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,890
Mrs. Shiraishi...

379
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,490
Fumiko...

380
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,990
There are people throughout Japan

381
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,590
who are waiting for the sake that you make.

382
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,890
I'll wait for you too.

383
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,590
I'll wait till you come back

384
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,390
while continuing to make genuine sake.

385
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,490
A case was thus, closed.

386
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,890
They don't have it here after all, the Takakuma.

387
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,390
Takakuma, Takakuma...

388
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,090
Who cares, I'll just get anything that's around!

389
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,590
You're still buying?

390
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,890
It's more quantity than quality after all...

391
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,490
Black vinegar is good for the health.

392
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,990
Like father like daughter, really...

393
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,517
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:36,117
"The news"

395
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,617
The next episode is Love Story 6?

396
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:39,717
I think this will continue till the 100th episode.

397
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:41,117
I feel sorry for the two.
