1
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:04,425
Ms. Kobayashi witnesses a murder

2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:07,025
during the night of the fireworks.

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:09,425
Never mind, just give me that!

4
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:10,725
I'm going to kill you.

5
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:13,525
Are you all right?

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,325
The victim is the woman owner of a pawn shop,

7
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,225
Ms. Akira Sumida.

8
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:24,003
Among the people who held a grudge against her,

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,225
three people were brought in as suspects

10
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,007
because they had no alibi on the day of the murder.

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,725
However, despite Ms. Kobayashi overhearing quarreling

12
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:33,025
between the culprit and the victim,

13
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:35,425
she was unable to select a voice

14
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:38,025
that matched the bellowing from the recorded voices.

15
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:40,725
Ms. Kobayashi is acting strange.

16
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:45,025
She for some reason seems to be avoiding Inspector Shiratori.

17
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:46,825
It seems she misunderstood

18
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49,225
the relationship between Officer Sato and Inspector Shiratori.

19
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:53,425
Inspector Shiratori visits Teitan Elementary School

20
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,225
to get rid of her misunderstanding but...

21
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:59,425
I've met you long, long time ago.

22
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,525
The little girl that stopped some boys

23
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,725
from shoplifting in a bookstore.

24
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:06,925
I was moved by that girl.

25
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:09,725
That's why I became a police officer.

26
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,925
After seeing how courageous you were.

27
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:15,625
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

28
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,925
Besides, isn't that girl...

29
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,925
I think you've mistaken Officer Sato for me, haven't you?

30
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,225
If you will excuse me...

31
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,065
Wait.

32
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,725
Brooding over passing seasons

33
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,725
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

34
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,625
Both love and the case is solved at once?

35
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,625
News about Thief Kid comes bursting in too.

36
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,095
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,097
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,425
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:30,189
"Timeless Cherry Blossom Love Affair"

40
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,641
It seems that your trump card...

41
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,195
didn't work for you.

42
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,241
It's because you keep putting it off and don't tell her about it.

43
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:41,941
Besides, didn't you change the story too?

44
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:44,203
You didn't become an officer

45
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:48,207
because you saw Ms. Kobayashi bite back at the shoplifters,

46
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,209
but because of the cherry blossom flower decoration

47
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,841
she made out of a paper straw wrapper and gave to you, right?

48
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,215
Right, right.

49
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,241
It's because Ms. Kobayashi told you that Cherry blossoms are a mark

50
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,841
that all people of the police have on them

51
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,041
and that they symbolize strength, kindness

52
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,441
and is an awesome flower of justice isn't it?

53
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,741
No.

54
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:09,741
I thought it better to tell her that I became a police officer

55
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,241
because I saw how courageous she was.

56
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:14,541
I think that the words "courageous" and "police detective"

57
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:19,841
made Ms. Kobayashi imagine Officer Sato, who resembled her.

58
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,141
I'll go rephrase my sentence.

59
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,941
No good.

60
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:26,245
Making excuses from now would only worsen the situation.

61
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,741
I don't think she'd even give you a chance to talk.

62
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,541
What should I do, then?

63
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,641
There's only one way...

64
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,341
If you arrest the culprit that Ms. Kobayashi witnessed

65
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:40,741
and prove that her testimony was correct,

66
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,241
maybe she'll open her heart.

67
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,263
No, but...

68
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,841
But, weren't there any suspects

69
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:49,241
that matched the voice that Ms. Kobayashi heard?

70
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,269
No.

71
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,241
She did say that she saw the silhouetted figure

72
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,041
of the culprit flee, though.

73
00:04:55,041 --> 00:05:00,041
It seems that all she could tell was that the woman had breasts

74
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,941
and had her long hair bunched and tied in the back.

75
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:05,241
Besides, the mover's truck-like vehicle

76
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,941
with large numbers "0" and "9" printed on it,

77
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,041
that she also saw hasn't been found either.

78
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,341
What kind of people were the suspects?

79
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:14,293
A former leader of a woman motorbike gang

80
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,841
with a foul mouth, Ms. Kikuna Kagitani.

81
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:20,299
And the woman owner of a Japanese cuisine restaurant,

82
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,301
who had a cold, Ms. Ryoko Takimoto.

83
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,541
Finally, former high school baseball player who hurt his shoulder

84
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:30,309
and is now working at a host club, Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

85
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:34,041
But at this point it's difficult to pinpoint the culprit

86
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,741
based on Ms. Kobayashi's testimony.

87
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,941
Then, are saying that Ms. Kobayashi is lying?

88
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,741
Ms. Kobayashi would never lie.

89
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,941
No.

90
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,341
Then, all we have to do is make a deduction.

91
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:48,327
That is, why Ms. Kobayashi was put under that illusion?

92
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,041
-An illusion? -Right. An illusion.

93
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,041
Conan!

94
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:59,041
What's up, Conan?

95
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,339
Was someone there?

96
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,141
Yes, a suspicious looking silhouetted figure

97
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,041
was looking in on us.

98
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,345
Wasn't it the culprit?

99
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:07,741
It's possible.

100
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:11,041
Since it seems that the culprit saw Ms. Kobayashi's face.

101
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,351
Idiot.

102
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,353
You can't tell who or where the person is

103
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,941
from by just looking at someone's face.

104
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:19,141
The culprit is probably is a camera brat

105
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,041
who relishes sneakily taking pictures of little girls or something.

106
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,361
What?

107
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,641
Well, staying here isn't going to get us anywhere

108
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:26,041
so let's head home.

109
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:30,141
Ms. Kobayashi said she'd be working late today again making texts,

110
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,641
so she won't be coming out for some time yet.

111
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,941
Hey, Conan!

112
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,641
-Please wait! -Conan!

113
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,385
Hey, you guys...

114
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:04,403
Yes, this is Teitan Elementary.

115
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,405
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

116
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,041
I'm calling from the police.

117
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,409
May I speak to Ms. Kobayashi please?

118
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,741
I'm Kobayashi.

119
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,341
I said I have nothing more to tell the police.

120
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,841
The car with the numbers "0" and "9"

121
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,441
that you witnessed has been found.

122
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,741
We've taken a picture of it,

123
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,341
so I was wondering if you could confirm it.

124
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,541
Yes. Then please come with that picture at a later date.

125
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,741
No, since I wanted you to confirm it right away,

126
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:35,141
I had the guard open the gate for me,

127
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:36,435
and I'm already in the school building.

128
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,437
I see.

129
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,141
Then, please come to the teachers' room.

130
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:42,241
How about the music room?

131
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,443
The thing is, this is my alma mater,

132
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:46,441
and I used to belong to the brass band club.

133
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:50,449
I felt so nostalgic that I was looking around here and there.

134
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:51,941
Really?

135
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:53,641
I'll see you in the music room, then.

136
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,441
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

137
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,841
This school is his alma mater?

138
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,741
I wonder what year he graduated.

139
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:06,465
Maybe he used to be my classmate.

140
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:20,041
But the music room was renovated last year

141
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,841
and all the walls and desks were changed,

142
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,041
so how could he feel nostalgic?

143
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:31,141
Besides, his voice just now sounds familiar.

144
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,141
"Music Room"

145
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,041
Make sure you be careful when you fall.

146
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,341
Darn. What the...

147
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,545
Who the hell are you?

148
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,547
The Metropolitan Police Department First Investigation Division,

149
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,241
Criminal Investigation Section 3,

150
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,341
Assistant Inspector, Miwako Sato.

151
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:34,941
Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

152
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,555
An officer?

153
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,141
Aren't you a teacher?

154
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,561
The real teacher was taken into custody

155
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,541
in the corridor by Officer Shiratori

156
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,641
and they switched.

157
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:51,141
Which means that you knew that I'd come here?

158
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:52,571
Yes.

159
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,541
By what Ms. Kobayashi testified.

160
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,575
Don't be ridiculous.

161
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:58,577
She also said unreliable things such as the culprit is a woman

162
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,741
or that she saw a car with the numbers "0" and "9" printed on it.

163
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,583
Isn't she, that teacher?

164
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:06,585
She's not unreliable.

165
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,941
The culprit just looked like a woman to her.

166
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,591
Your elbow, when she saw the silhouette of you fleeing,

167
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,593
just happened to look like the breast of a woman

168
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:18,041
since you had one hand on the shoulder that you hurt.

169
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,941
In addition, since there were several incidents

170
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:23,041
in which a woman mugger was attacking in that area,

171
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,441
it's understandable that she probably intuitively thought

172
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,605
that the culprit was a woman.

173
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,941
Besides, that lady,

174
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:31,341
no matter how you look at her, she's a man.

175
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:33,341
The arguing voices that Ms. Kobayashi heard

176
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,241
were that of a man and woman

177
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:38,617
and if the corpse that was found later was that of a man,

178
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:42,341
it's understandable that she would think that the culprit is a woman.

179
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,341
Is this how the deduction goes?

180
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,141
Yes. Because she wouldn't possibly think

181
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,741
that the shouting voice was that of the victim.

182
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,631
Well... you too seem to have tried to deceive everyone

183
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,633
by cutting off your long hair.

184
00:10:56,041 --> 00:11:00,041
And the numbers that Ms. Kobayashi saw on the car at the site

185
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,741
were not "0" and "9" but rather,

186
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,441
the alphabets "O and S".

187
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:10,041
It's standing for Osaka Smile Transport Company.

188
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,041
They looked like numbers because they were cut off by a wall.

189
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:19,541
That car was that of Dr. Agasa's friend who was moving.

190
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,541
I confirmed with the driver of the truck just a while ago.

191
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,141
And he said that he saw you

192
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:28,441
and the victim go into that alley of the murder site.

193
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,841
By the way,

194
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:36,341
you found out that Ms. Kobayashi was an elementary teacher

195
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,541
because I called out "teacher" at the scene of the crime.

196
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,641
After all, if a child calls out teacher,

197
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:43,741
the first thing that comes to mind

198
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,341
would be an elementary school teacher.

199
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:48,041
So, you asked around the elementary schools

200
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,341
in the vicinity and found her.

201
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,341
You attempted to shut her up, didn't you?

202
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:52,691
Yes.

203
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,241
I was going to threaten and scare her

204
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,041
before she recalled everything,

205
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,641
and stop her from testifying further.

206
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,641
I didn't want to land up in prison

207
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:04,441
just for killing that devil.

208
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:08,341
But that devil lent you 5,000,000 yen, didn't she?

209
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,941
Yes, right.

210
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:13,241
It costs money to continue pursuing a dream.

211
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,715
Treatment fee for my shoulder as well as for training.

212
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:20,741
That lady seem to have been a fan of high school baseball,

213
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,741
knew me and had high hopes for me.

214
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,941
But as soon as she found out that I damaged my shoulder for good,

215
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,441
she started acting totally different

216
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,241
and treated me as if I were a broken piece of junk.

217
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,541
I still had hopes of being a batter,

218
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,941
but she pressed me every day to give her back what she lent me.

219
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:38,041
She went as far as to tell me

220
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,739
that I could join life insurance so to give her my seal.

221
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,541
Which means that the remark of the victim,

222
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,341
"Never mind, just give me that" was...

223
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,841
Yes, she meant my seal.

224
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:51,841
She was planning to make me join life insurance then kill me.

225
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,753
That's why I killed her before she got to kill me!

226
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,241
I did it to continue pursuing my dream!

227
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,757
I killed her in self-defense!

228
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,541
Criminal Code 36.

229
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,341
When someone suddenly wrongly infringes on you,

230
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,541
any action performed out of necessity to protect oneself

231
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,041
or another is not to be punished.

232
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,341
In case the degree of protection

233
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,241
exceeds what is considered enough,

234
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,441
the punishment may be lessened

235
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,141
or exempt after taking into account all circumstances.

236
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:22,781
This is the provision described under self-defense.

237
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,041
During the time the crime was committed,

238
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,785
you had a knife in your possession and had the intent to kill.

239
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,141
Therefore, neither of what I just stated applies to you.

240
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,741
In addition, using a bat, a tool that should be used

241
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:37,141
to pursue your dream, as a weapon to shut someone up,

242
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:41,341
you don't even the tiniest right to talk of your dreams.

243
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:44,241
Criminal code provision 255.

244
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,805
Anyone who takes the possessions of another

245
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,807
will be punished for stealing...

246
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,841
and serve a sentence of less than 10 years.

247
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:58,817
Maybe long ago I met you at a bookstore.

248
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:03,641
So, you finally remembered.

249
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,641
From way before these children were born,

250
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,841
I was in love with you.

251
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:16,841
Yes.

252
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,741
Dorky.

253
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:20,841
Come, come now.

254
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:22,041
Hey, hey, Conan.

255
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:26,141
Is she the teacher that Shiratori is head over heels over?

256
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,741
Yes.

257
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,741
She sure looks familiar.

258
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,441
It's you, she looks like you.

259
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:34,853
You mean you served as her double not realizing why you were doing it.

260
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:43,941
Mr. Shiratori.

261
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:46,865
We're going to go eat lunch from now, would you...

262
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,641
No, I'm not going.

263
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,441
Because I have this.

264
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,873
See you, then.

265
00:14:56,641 --> 00:15:00,241
I'm sure that's home-made lunch made by Ms. Kobayashi.

266
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,141
Home-made lunch.

267
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,341
Ms. Sato?

268
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,441
Sato!

269
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,441
Please make lunch for me too, next time...

270
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,541
Lunch... next?

271
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,897
If you're going to the convenience store to buy lunch,

272
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,541
will please get me one too.

273
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,341
I'll leave what you'll buy up to you.

274
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:24,903
As long as it fills me up, anything's okay.

275
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,341
Yes.

276
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,909
Mr. Takagi, hang in there.

277
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:37,527
"Second term"

278
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:38,917
Did you see that?

279
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,627
Thief Kid's news this morning.

280
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:41,827
I saw it. I saw it.

281
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,927
He seems to have sent out a letter of challenge again.

282
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:48,727
He is after the big jewel owned by Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.

283
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,427
The horn of the giraffe.

284
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:53,927
It seems to be valuable amber that is embedded with a seed

285
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,227
from several million years ago.

286
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:58,627
But, he's sure sending his letter of challenge out early.

287
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:02,227
Regarding the amber that was discovered at the old temple,

288
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,927
wasn't it just last week?

289
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,027
Well, since they had it advertised on TV

290
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,927
and in newspapers every single day,

291
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,927
even Thief Kid would take the bait.

292
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,327
But wait, do girrafe have horns?

293
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,827
They do. Two small ones.

294
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,827
You're talking about giraffes.

295
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:22,527
The one in question is said to be completely covered in golden scales,

296
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,927
is shaped like a deer,

297
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,527
has a cow's tail and a horse's hooves.

298
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,027
Growing from its dragon-like head is a single horn.

299
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,971
It's a divine beast from Chinese mythology.

300
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,027
Then, it's akin to azure dragon and white tiger.

301
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,827
So have you been summoned again?

302
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:42,027
No, I haven't heard anything yet.

303
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:45,527
How about, Edogawa?

304
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,527
Looks like you're having another duel with Thief Kid.

305
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,627
Do you have a strategy prepared?

306
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,327
No.

307
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:54,993
Just Conan again?

308
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,727
How nice. We want to duel with Thief Kid too.

309
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,427
It can't be helped.

310
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:03,627
Conan is the one who chases Thief Kid away every time.

311
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:07,027
Members of the Youth Detective Squad, how about a word too?

312
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,727
What is it?

313
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,227
Will you tell us what you intend to do?

314
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,427
Why them too?

315
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:17,015
Haven't you heard about it yet?

316
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,017
Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki announced it

317
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,327
at the press conference today.

318
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,021
This time, he said that he would ask

319
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:26,027
all the members of the Youth Detective Squad to help him.

320
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,027
No way.

321
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,127
Why?

322
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,627
Advisor,

323
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:33,427
I have my doubts about letting the children

324
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,827
into the site where Thief Kid is planning to attack.

325
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:39,927
Can't you tell from looking at his letter of challenge.

326
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,327
The night of the next full moon at 7 pm,

327
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,045
I will go to get a hold of the horn of the giraffe.

328
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:48,727
From Thief Kid.

329
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:51,927
Let's cut out all childish acts this time

330
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:55,053
and decide victory by adult methods.

331
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,327
That guy goofed from his side.

332
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,227
Mentioning adult methods,

333
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:02,327
he means don't call children.

334
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,627
In other words, Thief Kid is not at home with kids.

335
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,727
Not at home with kids?

336
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,067
Right.

337
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,069
No matter how good he is,

338
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:15,073
he can't disguise himself as a child who is short.

339
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,827
Therefore, my strategy is to call a lot of children

340
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:20,127
that he doesn't want around.

341
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:21,927
I see.

342
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:23,727
Moreover, the night of the full moon

343
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,127
that he warned of is the day after tomorrow.

344
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:29,527
It's the day that the typhoon will strike that mountain temple.

345
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,089
His hand glider that he's so at home with

346
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,527
probably can't be used blocked by the rain and wind.

347
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:38,527
Thief Kid without his wings is no more than a baby.

348
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,827
I will capture Thief Kid along with the Youth Detective Squad

349
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:44,527
in front of the TV camera,

350
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:49,107
and end my autobiography with beautiful victory.

351
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:02,427
You all look good,

352
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,627
in that detective parker.

353
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,127
-Thank you. -Thank you...

354
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,827
Then, let me introduce myself.

355
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:12,827
"Juri Shinkai (37)" -I'm journalist Juri Shinkai.

356
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,127
How do you do?

357
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:18,227
The one sitting next to me is cameraman, Mr. Masui.

358
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,827
"Shougo Masui (41)" -How do you do?

359
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:23,141
And the one in the front seat is...

360
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,143
Let's see...

361
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,627
"Tsutomu Hizumi (38)" -Hello.

362
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,147
I'm Hizumi in charge of audio.

363
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,151
I heard that the audio man was young man.

364
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,627
They couldn't get a hold of him,

365
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:38,927
so I ended up coming here all of a sudden.

366
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,159
I hope that young punk didn't take off

367
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,427
because he panicked about the typhoon that's coming.

368
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,727
It started to rain.

369
00:19:57,427 --> 00:20:00,727
I've been waiting for you members of the Youth Detective Squad.

370
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:04,527
How do you like it? The clothes that I gave you?

371
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:07,185
Did you make this parker for us?

372
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,187
Yes. I thought you'd look more

373
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:12,027
like the detective squad with uniformed clothes.

374
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,527
Thank you. We love it.

375
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:19,197
And? Where's the horn of the giraffe?

376
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:21,227
The way I see it...

377
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,927
there's a large pillar in the center

378
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:26,927
and on all four corners

379
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,327
there are a white, black and green

380
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,227
and red pedestal.

381
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:34,827
A copper pedestal.

382
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:38,027
The color is faded, and the upper part is bumpy.

383
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:40,027
It seems like a statue of something was attached there,

384
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,627
but was taken away.

385
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:43,827
Look. Look.

386
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,027
There's what looks to be a keyhole.

387
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,527
Yes.

388
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:50,127
Hold it.

389
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,427
Hey, don't touch it.

390
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,427
Inspector Nakamori.

391
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,327
You should've at least told the brats

392
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:59,227
that a slight electric current is applied to the pedestal.

393
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:02,227
Children don't learn unless you give them pain.

394
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,327
And where's the horn?

395
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,627
I'll let you see it right now.

396
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:12,427
By using these four white, black, red and green keys.

397
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:13,727
Inspector Nakamori,

398
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,427
I'd like your men to help me.

399
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:21,027
Sure. Make sure you turn the electric current off.

400
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,263
Stop the electric current once.

401
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,327
Roger.

402
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,267
Are you going to use the keys that are the same color as the pedestals?

403
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,427
Yes.

404
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,273
What's this sound?

405
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,275
It's the sound of the electric current flowing

406
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,927
to the pedestal being cut off.

407
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,927
Each sound corresponds to the green,

408
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:43,281
red, white and black pedestal's

409
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,927
electric current being turned off.

410
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:47,285
Inspector, please send the signal.

411
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:48,727
Okay.

412
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,289
-All right. One, two... -What's that sound just now?

413
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,291
-That's... -three.

414
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:03,927
The pillar in the middle is...

415
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:05,303
Cracking open.

416
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,627
Something's coming out...

417
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:07,727
From inside.

418
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,127
So, this is the giraffe.

419
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,227
Awesome.

420
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:23,321
So, the yellow jewelry on its head is the...

421
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,827
Yes, it's probably the amber that's being referred to

422
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:28,027
as the "Horn of the Giraffe."

423
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,327
Beautiful.

424
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:34,627
Okay. Come whenever you like, Thief Kid.

425
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:39,327
I'm going to get you for sure this time.

426
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,194
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,440
"Sparrow".

428
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,900
We'll capture Thief Kid.

429
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,427
-Yes. -Yes...

430
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,980
They're all out to get.
