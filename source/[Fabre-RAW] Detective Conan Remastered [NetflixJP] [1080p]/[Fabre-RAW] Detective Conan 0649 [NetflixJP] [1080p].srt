1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,329
At the Mouri Detective Agency,

2
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:07,229
a man who showed up after following the three ladies,

3
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,529
intimidated everyone with his gun and bombs,

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,329
and besieged the entire place.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,993
Pops and Ran who were at the scene,

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,029
as well as Sera, who we met during the haunted hotel case,

7
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,329
all became hostages.

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,029
The man's name was Isao Sawaguri.

9
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,005
He's the elder brother of Miku Sawaguri,

10
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,929
a mystery writer who killed herself at a hot spring inn a month ago.

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,529
Sawaguri who refused to believe that his sister committed suicide,

12
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,529
ordered the great detective Sleeping Kogoro

13
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:39,429
to shed some light on the truth.

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,729
The three ladies he brought here

15
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,529
were all amateur mystery writers and friends with Miku.

16
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,429
An unmarried woman who is helping her family's stone-dealer's store,

17
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,429
Ms. Tamami Mitsui.

18
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,229
Ms. Shinobu Yuchi, the once-divorced,

19
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,229
who now works at the neighborhood bakery.

20
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,529
And a homemaker and the wife of a seal cutter craftsman,

21
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,529
Ms. Sumika Nihei.

22
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:02,829
Sawaguri suspected that one of them murdered his sister

23
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,729
and made it appear to be a suicide.

24
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:10,329
The three stayed at the same hotel with Miku

25
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,429
and visited her room in succession

26
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,829
to have her autograph their books

27
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,329
just before she died.

28
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,629
Although Miku had been posting what had transpired via SNS,

29
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,329
she had nicknamed the three Elephant, Fox, and Rat,

30
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:29,529
leaving us wondering about who was who and the order of their visits.

31
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:33,429
The last to have visited Miku's room

32
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:35,029
and thought to be responsible

33
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,729
for disguising her murder as a suicide was the Rat, but who was it?

34
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,829
But then, Sawaguri announced that once the culprit is revealed,

35
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,129
he would kill her and commit suicide.

36
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:50,629
How am I supposed to rescue Ran

37
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,029
and the others without any fatalities?

38
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:15,029
If all cases were men,

39
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,629
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

40
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,117
Adrenaline races at the Detective Agency

41
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,119
where Ran takes action in a surprising manner.

42
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,929
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:23,729
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,125
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

45
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:55,967
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Sniping)"

46
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,567
Darn.

47
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,221
Trying to play smart with me, little witch.

48
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,223
You've got quite the nerve.

49
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:09,067
You do know what's going to happen, right?

50
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,667
Hold it. It wasn't her, the one who did it was...

51
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:12,667
It was me.

52
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,567
I was the one who made her do it.

53
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:20,239
Shinichi Kudo did.

54
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,967
Shinichi Kudo?

55
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,267
Shinichi?

56
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:33,567
Conan's using someone else's voice again.

57
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,867
Yeah.

58
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,667
All right. It's getting pretty late.

59
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,567
Time to get to bed, you guys.

60
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:42,567
-But, we... -Hey, just, hurry.

61
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,067
I thought it'd be best if I could also hear the details of the case,

62
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,269
so that I'd be able to answer your demand.

63
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,967
Unless, you have any objections against my involvement?

64
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:58,067
No, with a famous high school detective getting involved,

65
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,567
I'm all the more assured.

66
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:04,667
Then please tell Detective Mouri to take camera phone pictures

67
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,867
of all the case related materials you brought,

68
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:09,767
and send them to Dr. Agasa's computer.

69
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,367
You should also send along

70
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,067
pictures of the three books Miku autographed.

71
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:17,267
Also, it'd help if you could put me on a speaker phone.

72
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,297
Yes.

73
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,267
Hey, hustle up and take them.

74
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:25,167
I know.

75
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,167
Shinichi.

76
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,267
Why is he on Conan's phone?

77
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,667
Judging from the monitor here,

78
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:40,319
the page appears distorted only on Nihie's autographed copy.

79
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,667
Does it actually look that way?

80
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,467
Yes, only the autographed page is wrinkled

81
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,327
as if it were wet once and then dried.

82
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:49,767
Don't tell me...

83
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:50,967
It was you!

84
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,467
It wasn't me.

85
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,767
Plus, if it had gotten wet then,

86
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,767
wouldn't the entire book have become wrinkled?

87
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,667
Suppose so.

88
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,667
Next about Yuchi's autographed book,

89
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,345
it looks like a brand-new copy

90
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,667
without any finger marks or creases.

91
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,367
Is it really the first edition?

92
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:16,355
Yes, it does say here that it was from the first printing.

93
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,067
It's because I made sure to keep it safe,

94
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,667
given that it's a precious signed copy.

95
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:26,667
And as for Mitsui, it's a bit torn, isn't it?

96
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,167
It is. I see the tear mark.

97
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,371
That's because after Miku had finished autographing my book,

98
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:36,375
she was being mean and wouldn't let me use the toilet in her room.

99
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,167
Being mean?

100
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,167
That day, I had an upset my stomach

101
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,767
and even though I really had to unload,

102
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:47,567
Miku wouldn't let me use the toilet in her room.

103
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,967
She refused, telling me it was because she was going to use it soon.

104
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,967
But I knew she was just trying to bully me.

105
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,395
Since she also lied about having taken a bath in her room

106
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,399
even though she'd just come back from the large baths.

107
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,401
How'd you know she lied?

108
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,067
Because when I was leaving Miku's room,

109
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,967
I accidently put her slippers on,

110
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:11,167
and they were soaking wet and warm.

111
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:14,413
When I went to her room,

112
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,267
I lined up her slippers as well

113
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:21,467
but they were neither wet nor warm at all.

114
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,423
Are you sure you didn't put your own slippers on?

115
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,425
Since it looks like you have greasy skin.

116
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,767
How rude. I have dry skin.

117
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,431
What a noisy bunch of old women.

118
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,467
Cheeping and chirping like a bunch of lilt birds.

119
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:39,367
Well, I admit I've also been called annoying by my sister,

120
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:43,467
so she gave me the weird nickname of Bush warbler.

121
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,667
Bush warbler?

122
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:50,449
Bush warbler, Elephant, Fox, and Rat...

123
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,467
I see, I've got it.

124
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,467
Miku's nickname scheme.

125
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:08,467
It seems this'll come to an end even without having to trouble Kudo.

126
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,473
If that's the case, no doubt the culprit is that person.

127
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:16,867
Looks like you've got that face

128
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,767
you always get when you've figured it out,

129
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,467
but what now?

130
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,967
Even if you've come up with the right culprit,

131
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,067
there'll still be two corpses

132
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,867
hitting the floor in that detective agency.

133
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,267
Hey, what do you mean?

134
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,967
What you just said about how this might come to an end

135
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,495
without having to trouble Shinichi?

136
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,497
The reason I propped your cell phone open

137
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,967
with the strap mascot and preserved the connection,

138
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,503
was so that Conan could learn about the case

139
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,505
and investigate it for us.

140
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,867
The incident happened last month on the 4th,

141
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:50,767
the same day your neighborhood association

142
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,511
went on their hot spring trip, right?

143
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,567
What's more, the inn they stayed at was, Furitsukaya,

144
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,517
where that bomber man's sister,

145
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:02,867
novelist Miku Sawaguri, supposedly committed suicide.

146
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,167
Is that so?

147
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,767
Yes. There was a fax with information

148
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:10,529
about the neighborhood association's hot spring outing

149
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,767
on your papa's desk.

150
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,967
The fact it was left out

151
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,535
means that your papa didn't go on that outing.

152
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,167
Since there were details such as a map to the inn,

153
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,541
and meeting places on the fax,

154
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,567
he would've brought it with him if he had gone,

155
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,967
and wouldn't have put it back on his desk upon his return, right?

156
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,567
That's why I left the phone connected,

157
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,967
hoping that Conan would get the story

158
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,967
from those who went to the hot spring trip.

159
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,067
But for some reason,

160
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,067
Shinichi Kudo answered Conan's phone.

161
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:42,867
Well, I don't know what sort of connection Conan has

162
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,867
with that famous high school detective,

163
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,467
but that bomber guy is convinced

164
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,367
that his sister didn't commit suicide,

165
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:53,367
and that someone among the three killed her,

166
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,067
he plans to commit murder-suicide with the culprit

167
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,467
once he finds out who she is.

168
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,267
So at this point, I have no choice

169
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,867
but to have him negotiate with the bomber man and talk him down

170
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,567
or so I had thought,

171
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,367
but now that's not necessary anymore.

172
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,867
How come?

173
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,767
You see that light outside the window?

174
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,597
That's probably proof

175
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:22,167
that the police have arrived at the building across the street.

176
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,267
Sniping Support Unit in position.

177
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,167
We've got eyes-on.

178
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,611
And the Takedown Unit?

179
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,613
In position at the agency entrance.

180
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,615
Ready to break through on your order.

181
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:37,667
Copy that.

182
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,067
Attention, all units.

183
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,567
Suspect is acting alone,

184
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,267
however we have info that he is armed with a handgun

185
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,767
and has a large number of bombs in possession.

186
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,467
Until I give the order standby

187
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,629
but be ready to move on a moment's notice.

188
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,631
So the police are here?

189
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,667
First to come was the Special Investigative Team

190
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,637
made up of the Criminal Investigative Department First Division,

191
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,639
abbreviated as SIT.

192
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,567
When hostage-taking incidents occur,

193
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,167
they roll out with heavy equipment,

194
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,767
and if the culprit doesn't respond to persuasion.

195
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:14,367
They're forcing their way in and taking decisive action.

196
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:20,067
So even now, they should be on the other side of that door,

197
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,667
on the watch for an opportunity to charge in.

198
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,867
What?

199
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:27,167
The fact that they're on the roof with the intent to snipe

200
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,967
means the Special Assault Team, SAT has also come to back them up.

201
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,967
Did Shinichi call for them?

202
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,667
Well, even if he didn't, they'd still come.

203
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,667
Since in order to evacuate the customers from the shop downstairs,

204
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,367
he'd have to explain the situation to the police.

205
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:47,467
But, judging from how the police have yet to start talking him down,

206
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,967
it appears they have extreme confidence

207
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,567
in your boyfriend.

208
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:55,567
He likely requested the police not to make moves

209
00:11:55,567 --> 00:12:00,367
and guaranteed to talk the bomber man down himself, I'd wager.

210
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,667
After all, we're dealing with a crazy man

211
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,703
who has bombs strapped to himself

212
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,267
and his finger hovering over the switch.

213
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,967
If they make the wrong move and barge in

214
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,067
or snipe in a place that isn't a vital point,

215
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,711
it'd enrage him

216
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,267
and he'd press the switch

217
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,067
and we'd be blown to smithereens.

218
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,767
In order for that not to happen,

219
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,467
he'd either need to be persuaded,

220
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,721
or taken down with one shot.

221
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,723
Hey, what's the hold up?

222
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,467
Haven't you figured it out yet, Shinichi Kudo?

223
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,167
I know we already sent them to your computer.

224
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,167
My little sister's posting on SNS just before she was killed.

225
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,667
These postings told of

226
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,737
how my sister let each of these three people into her room,

227
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:43,067
and how she autographed first-edition copies of her debut work for them.

228
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,743
And the postings were...

229
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,867
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

230
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,167
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

231
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,467
that pesky Elephant.

232
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,267
Next to come was Fox.

233
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,567
Trying to stir up an argument again, freaking annoying.

234
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,267
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

235
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,761
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

236
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,367
I'll make short work of the autograph

237
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,367
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

238
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,767
Darn, she's still here.

239
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,367
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

240
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,771
What should I do?

241
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,167
And her posting ends here.

242
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,267
In short...

243
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,367
It was one of these three people,

244
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,967
the ones who were the last to come,

245
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,067
that killed my sister and made it look to be a suicide,

246
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,785
that freaking Rat.

247
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:33,067
Hey, you guys.

248
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,267
Didn't I tell you to go to bed already?

249
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:38,167
But, we're so worried that we can't sleep.

250
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,067
And there was something we forgot to mention.

251
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,367
When we went to ask people about the case,

252
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:46,367
most of the neighborhood association members said...

253
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,967
that about two or three days ago,

254
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,067
a brown-haired man in camouflage

255
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,811
had come around asking the same things we did.

256
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,815
That man had shown them a book

257
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,817
and some photographs while asking

258
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,367
whether they had seen any of the three women

259
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,767
loitering around the inn

260
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,467
with his sister's debut book in hand.

261
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,067
I see.

262
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,829
So he'd already gone around asking for information.

263
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,833
It seems you've also done your own research,

264
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,367
How far have you gotten?

265
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:17,367
Well...

266
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,839
I did sniff out a whole lot about these three.

267
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,841
Sumika Nihei is high-strung

268
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,467
and even went as far as to line up

269
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,467
all the slippers of guests she didn't know.

270
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,847
And didn't get along with my sister

271
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,767
who was sloppy in comparison.

272
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:34,867
And since Shinobu Yuchi had been in the hot spring all the time.

273
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:38,367
Perhaps she was in fact washing the blood that splattered on her

274
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:42,067
after cutting my sister's wrist?

275
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:45,467
And Tamami Mitsui was seen rushing out of my sister's room

276
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,567
with her book in hand

277
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,467
by a guest from a room, three doors down.

278
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,867
So, hurry up and tell me.

279
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:55,267
Which one was it?

280
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:58,267
The murderer who my sister nicknamed Rat.

281
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,367
How is it?

282
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,967
Can you make the shot?

283
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,267
Negative.

284
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,567
The Detective Agency sign on the window glass

285
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,667
and Detective Mouri behind it are blocking the target.

286
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,567
Shinichi.

287
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,967
Perhaps you're thinking,

288
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:18,267
"Shinichi, why haven't you solved it yet?"

289
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,567
It's all right.

290
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,167
I'm sure he's already figured everything out.

291
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,367
That the Rat who killed Miku Sawaguri...

292
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,367
was her, namely Tamai Mitsui.

293
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,967
There's only one reason why he's not saying it,

294
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,467
once the bomber man knows who the culprit is,

295
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,267
he'll commit murder-suicide with her.

296
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,667
Looks like we'll have to use an alternative method

297
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,923
in order to prevent having two victims.

298
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:48,367
Although, it'll only turn two into one.

299
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,767
Hey.

300
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,767
That cell phone's been connected for quite a long time,

301
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,367
how's the battery doing?

302
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,667
Shouldn't we connect it to the AC adapter?

303
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,467
Right, you're right.

304
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:07,467
If I recall, it's in the drawer of Mr. Kogoro's desk, right?

305
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,967
Did I put it in there?

306
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:13,367
Hey, take it out now and connect it.

307
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:14,953
Are you sure?

308
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,955
You don't want to do it yourself?

309
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:20,167
If Kogoro has a weapon

310
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,567
or something hidden in that drawer,

311
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,267
he could counterattack, you know?

312
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,467
This guy...

313
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,167
Don't tell me...

314
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,667
Out of the way.

315
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,367
I'll find it.

316
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,967
The suspect has moved towards us.

317
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,867
He's in sight.

318
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,867
It's possible to snipe now.

319
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,267
What?

320
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,467
Do we shoot?

321
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:55,467
Shoot.

322
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:00,667
Shoot.

323
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:18,311
What the heck are you doing?

324
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:20,011
Do you want to die?

325
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:21,611
It's chilly tonight,

326
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,911
so I think it's best to close the curtains.

327
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:27,611
Also, the AC adapter is inside the cabinet,

328
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,411
I'll get it.

329
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:31,811
The curtains are closed.

330
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:34,111
Sniping the target is no longer possible.

331
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,311
You...

332
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,035
What were you thinking?

333
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,911
I'd hate to see someone die in front of me is all.

334
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,411
What do you mean you'd hate?

335
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:42,711
Plus...

336
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,911
Shinichi would never allow anyone to die.

337
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,045
Never.

338
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,411
Now, Shinichi Kudo.

339
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,911
I've sent everything you need for your deduction.

340
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,211
Who the heck killed my little sister?

341
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:59,057
If you still don't know, then I've got no choice.

342
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:02,111
Hate to do it, but I'll blow this agency to smithereens.

343
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,011
Although all I really want to do

344
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,611
is to ice that freaking Rat who killed my sister.

345
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,011
It's all right.

346
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,811
Please calm down.

347
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,111
Because I know the identity of the Rat.

348
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,073
Really?

349
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,211
Yes.

350
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,811
Don't... don't tell me,

351
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,111
he's going to name the culprit?

352
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:22,211
Shinichi?

353
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,411
I'll start with Elephant,

354
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:27,511
who was the first to visit Miku's room for an autograph.

355
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:30,311
If her hair hadn't dried from the bath,

356
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:33,091
her body should've been hot and humid too.

357
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,093
If she were to autograph in such a state,

358
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,311
the heat and dampness would wrinkle the paper, right?

359
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,099
So that means,

360
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,711
the Elephant who came first has got to be

361
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:45,103
the one who has the book with the autographed page wrinkled,

362
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,611
that is, Ms. Nihei.

363
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,511
Nihei has a methodical personality

364
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,109
to the extent of being too high-strung.

365
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,711
Unless something like that happened,

366
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:56,511
I bet she'd never treat the book roughly nor crumple it.

367
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,511
And when Ms. Nihei went to the room,

368
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:03,511
she said she lined up Miku's slippers too, right?

369
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:08,511
The fact that those slippers were neither wet nor warm...

370
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:11,129
means that Miku didn't go to the large baths,

371
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:14,311
but without a doubt took a bath in her room.

372
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:18,911
Since taking a bath in her room would not require her to wear slippers.

373
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:24,211
Why, then, were the slippers accidentally worn by Mitsui

374
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,611
as she was leaving Miku's room soaking wet

375
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:29,147
causing Mitsui to mistakenly think

376
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,511
that Miku had come back from the large bath?

377
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:37,155
The deal with the slippers was that Yuchi came there

378
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,911
shortly after taking a bath.

379
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:44,111
And inadvertently wore Miku's slippers on her way out,

380
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:47,165
Yuchi's remaining warm and dampened slippers were then worn by Mitsui.

381
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,511
In short, Elephant was Nihei,

382
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,211
next to show up was Fox, or Yuchi,

383
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:58,211
and leaving Mitsui to be Rat, the last one to come along.

384
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:00,911
I see, so it was you?

385
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,911
The freaking Rat who killed my sister?

386
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,811
What the...

387
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:07,811
You're only basing that decision off some slippers.

388
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,711
It wasn't just the slippers.

389
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:12,111
The nicknames Miku gave you all

390
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,811
were in fact based on colors.

391
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,111
Color?

392
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,195
In Japanese,

393
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,211
there are colors bearing the names of animals, right?

394
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,511
Like camel-color or Japanese ruddy duck-color.

395
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:23,811
Are you sure?

396
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:25,203
If you keep talking,

397
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,311
we'll really end up with two dead people here, you know?

398
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,611
Moreover...

399
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:32,811
Right in front of her, who believes in you.

400
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:36,211
The fox-color, or golden brown,

401
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:39,611
would be the color of the bread Yuchi bakes at her workplace.

402
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,219
Elephant means ivory-color,

403
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:44,811
the color of the seals Nihei's husband carves.

404
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,011
Incidentally, Miku's brother Isao's nickname

405
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:51,229
Bush warbler would resemble olive-green.

406
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:53,611
Taken from the name of the survival games

407
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:57,611
team Isao serves as the leader of, the Green Cap.

408
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:01,239
And Rat of course means the grayish rat-color,

409
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,811
the color of the stones Mitsui's family stonemasonry business deals with.

410
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:09,247
In other words, the Rat that was the last to show up to Miku's room...

411
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:11,249
Ms. Mitsui,

412
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,711
it can't be none other than you.

413
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:36,211
Just as expected of the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

414
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,611
Well done.

415
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:40,111
The dirty Rat, who freaking killed my sister, Miku

416
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:45,283
and made it look like a suicide, Tamami Mitsui...

417
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:48,711
He's made it clear that you were the one.

418
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:50,211
No, no...

419
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:52,911
I would never kill Miku.

420
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,611
Don't play dumb with me.

421
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:59,297
The famous high school detective is saying you're the culprit.

422
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,911
But... but it really wasn't me...

423
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:08,211
Any excuses you have I'll hear you out on the other side.

424
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,309
My sister's waiting in the other world.

425
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:16,111
Well, don't forget, you two karate kittens.

426
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:19,317
About the fact that I've got bombs strapped to my body.

427
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:23,311
And that as long as I can kill this witch,

428
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:25,611
I don't mind dying.

429
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,211
Darn.

430
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:32,211
Shinichi Kudo. What the heck are you going to do?

431
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:34,711
Shinichi, please.

432
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:37,335
Stop Sawaguri.

433
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:39,337
Shinichi.

434
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,140
"Toilet".

436
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,972
-Shall I take the stage from here? -No, that's okay.

437
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:09,427
-What'd you say? -Let Shinichi handle this.

438
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,760
Not you too.
