1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,540
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,640
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,440
Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,640
leaves the secret of the organization somewhere.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,060
"The Hidden Secret in the Toilet (Part 1)"

9
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,160
Do you know?

10
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
What?

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,660
If you put those on,

12
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,560
nobody will ever guess your identity.

13
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260
You fool!

14
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,960
Don't run, Ai.

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Don't run from destiny!

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,660
Besides, I gave her my word

17
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,860
that I would look after her if she gets into trouble.

18
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,760
Because she's not as tough as she looks.

19
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,260
There's medicine.

20
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,060
It seems like a doctor examined me.

21
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,660
But I don't remember that.

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,660
The only thing I remember

23
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,760
is that Doc carried me

24
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,360
and we left the department store.

25
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,060
If I remember correctly,

26
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,360
after that I...

27
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,760
How stupid of me.

28
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,260
If they had found me, I would be in no circumstance

29
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,460
to be dreaming something like that.

30
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,760
Dr. Agasa wouldn't be dozing off like that...

31
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,860
Doc?

32
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,760
Doc!

33
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,360
Hey, Ai.

34
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,760
So, you're up?

35
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,060
Tomato juice...

36
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,860
Tell Doc

37
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,560
not to drink canned tomato juice while surfing the Internet.

38
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,960
He always falls asleep part way and spills it.

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,760
By the way, why are you here?

40
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,460
I had this bad feeling, so I came to check on you.

41
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,660
I told Ran that I would help Doc take care of you.

42
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,160
Well, it seems it wasn't worth the worry,

43
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,260
so you can go back to sleep.

44
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

45
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,260
Your rice porridge is ready!

46
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,560
It's not as good as the one at Tamaga-tei, but...

47
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,660
She went to sleep?

48
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,960
That's strange.

49
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,260
I thought she was up just a minute ago.

50
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Okay, then. I'll leave this here.

51
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,760
After Ai eats this, tell her to let me know how it tastes.

52
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,160
See you. I've got to go and see Sonoko.

53
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,860
Go out the same way you came in.

54
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,160
Go through the basement

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,060
and then through the back door, right?

56
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,360
You'd better hurry and get the front door fixed, Doc.

57
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,460
Yeah.

58
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,660
Bye, Conan.

59
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
Thank you, Ran!

60
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,660
What's with you?

61
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,060
You're really good at fake crying,

62
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,060
but you're the pits when it comes to faking being asleep.

63
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,360
What is wrong with you?

64
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,660
She came all the way here to make rice porridge for you

65
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,160
and you ignored her completely!

66
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,660
I didn't ask her to do it for me.

67
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,160
I understand you don't care much for people like Ran

68
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
who like to take care of other people, but still...

69
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,060
She did make it for you,

70
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,560
so eat it before it gets cold.

71
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,160
You don't understand anything, do you?

72
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,560
Well, it's not that I want you to know either.

73
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,860
Anyway, we're lucky that the weekend has arrived.

74
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,360
Yeah. We can't let Ai go walking around

75
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
when weird guys are sniffing around.

76
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
It's hot.

77
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,060
It seems like Ai's recovering from her cold too.

78
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,960
At this rate, we may be able to go visit

79
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,260
Ai's father, Dr. Miyano's friend next week.

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,460
Hey. What is that about?

81
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,360
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

82
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,560
I asked my doctor acquaintances about Dr. Miyano

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,360
and found out that he had a childhood designer friend

84
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,660
who was with him together

85
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,760
in elementary, intermediate and high school.

86
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,560
Apparently, this designer helped him bind a book

87
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,160
that he had privately published.

88
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Although the book didn't sell well,

89
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,260
the design was innovative

90
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,460
and was reputed highly among the other doctors too.

91
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,960
If we see that person, we may be able to find out something

92
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,660
about the men in black you're looking for

93
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,160
and about Ai's parents too.

94
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
My father and mother...

95
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,660
You're not well at all!

96
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,260
We don't need to go today, do we?

97
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,360
We don't know where they're looking out for us, you know.

98
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,460
Aren't you the one who wants to go?

99
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,860
Well, it's true that I'd like to see him

100
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,260
to find out about those guys, but...

101
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,660
Then, stop blabbering.

102
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,360
Well, it's true that I'm worried,

103
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,760
but we're fine right now.

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm sure they haven't grasped anything on us yet.

105
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Yeah, I guess so.

106
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,560
If my deduction's correct...

107
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,760
we should all be in the world beyond by now.

108
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
"Dejima's Design Office"

109
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes. It's true that Atsushi Miyano and I

110
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,860
were childhood friends.

111
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,360
But unfortunately, I haven't seen him for the past 30 years.

112
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,460
The last time I saw him

113
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,660
"Souhei Dejima (54)" -was when he rented this house

114
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,360
"President of Design Office" -that he inherited from his parents to me.

115
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,060
Does that mean...

116
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,260
this house belongs to Dr. Miyano?

117
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,160
Yes. I wanted a design office,

118
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,960
so he said that he'd rent it to me

119
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
since he'd be leaving his house empty for a while.

120
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,660
I see.

121
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,960
I've been renting this house ever since for 30 years.

122
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,060
This is where father was born and raised.

123
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,960
Then, where did Dr. Miyano live after lending this house to you?

124
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,460
Beats me.

125
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,660
He said that he was going to a large research laboratory

126
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,960
of a sponsor that approved of his theory.

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,760
But I have no idea where that is.

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,860
-It's those guys. -Yes.

129
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,060
Most probably.

130
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,860
And? Did you not hear from Dr. Miyano after that?

131
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,460
No, I only received a postcard

132
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,460
saying that he got married.

133
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,160
That person came once when you were out, President Dejima.

134
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,460
-What? -Remember?

135
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,060
"Ukihiko Zaitsu (41)" -You would go out for walks

136
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,860
"Designer" -when you couldn't think of design ideas

137
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,360
and would stay out for quite some time.

138
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,960
He happened to come by just at that time.

139
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,460
He came along with a pretty foreign wife

140
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,560
and a cute, little girl who was about four or five years old.

141
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,360
He seemed to want to talk to you about something important

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,860
and he ended up spending the night here, then left.

143
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,360
I told him that you might be back soon, but...

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Didn't I tell you about it?

145
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,860
No!

146
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,860
By the way, his wife's name was Elena.

147
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,760
I think his daughter's name was Akemi.

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,060
My older sister...

149
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
Something seemed odd about them, right?

150
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,260
"Tetsuo Imai (52), Designer" -Yeah.

151
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,860
His daughter's mischief was really hard to handle.

152
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,760
She hid our tools all over the place.

153
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,260
She saw how troubled we were and seemed to enjoy it.

154
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,060
His wife remained quiet all the while,

155
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,360
so we thought she couldn't understand Japanese,

156
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,560
but later, she spoke in Japanese with her daughter.

157
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,260
Meanwhile, Dr. Miyano kept looking out the window

158
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,460
and seemed to be concerned about something.

159
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,860
Come to think of it,

160
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,860
a car was parked for some time outside this house.

161
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,260
It was a black car with smoked glass.

162
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,660
They were being watched.

163
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Hey, when was that exactly?

164
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,160
It was just after we reformed the old house

165
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,760
into an office, so...

166
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,560
I think it was about 20 years ago.

167
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,960
Did Dr. Miyano say anything to you before he left?

168
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,560
No.

169
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,660
Nothing that I remember.

170
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,560
By the way, what's your relationship with Dr. Miyano?

171
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,660
Oh, well. We're both doctors...

172
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,560
He's going to finally get married at his age!

173
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,060
But he didn't have the doctor's address,

174
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,460
so he came to ask you for it!

175
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,960
-Right? -Yeah...

176
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,660
I'll go buy lunch pretty soon.

177
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,760
Okay, get me a hamburger then.

178
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,860
"Isamu Natsuhori (35)" -You want the usual teriyaki and fish

179
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,560
"Designer" -with medium-sized french fries

180
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,760
and corn soup, right?

181
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,960
What else?

182
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,360
I'll have the same food as the president.

183
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
I'll have the same,

184
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,460
but add an apple pie and two large-sized coke.

185
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,060
You always drink too much.

186
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,460
That's why you have to go to the toilet so many times.

187
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,860
Sorry, I'm so much like a kid.

188
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,060
Imai, will you please get coffee for the guests too?

189
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,460
Yes, sir.

190
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,860
So, I don't know Dr. Miyano's address either.

191
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,060
I don't want to be rude,

192
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,760
but since we have work to do, after you drink your coffee...

193
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,260
Yes, of course.

194
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,460
Akemi dropped by some time ago.

195
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
She did?

196
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,060
Why...

197
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,740
Do you remember the girl?

198
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,440
The cute girl who came to use the toilet.

199
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,540
She greeted us saying, "Long time no see",

200
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,740
and we were surprised by that.

201
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,140
Was she Dr. Miyano's daughter?

202
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,640
What? Didn't I tell you?

203
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,740
I said, you didn't tell me!

204
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,040
Sorry!

205
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,340
Did that woman really come just to use the toilet?

206
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,940
Yeah. But she did say something strange.

207
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,740
She said she was embarrassed that she came to use the toilet,

208
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,240
so she mentioned not to tell anybody about it.

209
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,140
I wonder who she wanted to keep it a secret from.

210
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,340
Hey, wait.

211
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,340
There.

212
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,740
You're both going in together?

213
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,940
There's no doubt about it.

214
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,340
Akemi definitely hid something here.

215
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,840
Yeah, it's somewhere in this toilet.

216
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,140
But even if she hid something in a small toilet like this...

217
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,940
I'm sure that someone would've found it already.

218
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,840
Yeah. It's very likely.

219
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
But still...

220
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,340
we might just discover something.

221
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,040
Clues that will shed light on who those guys are.

222
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Hey!

223
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,140
Hurry!

224
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Will you please hurry up?

225
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,540
I guess we'll search again later.

226
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,640
Yes.

227
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,740
Thanks for waiting!

228
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,240
Do you kids want to have some too?

229
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,140
No, thanks.

230
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,540
Hey, did anything strange happen

231
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
after that woman came?

232
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,240
Yeah. A burglar broke in.

233
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,440
And it happened twice.

234
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
A burglary?

235
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,540
Nothing was stolen though.

236
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,740
Is your stomach okay?

237
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,340
Yeah, it's getting better somehow.

238
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,540
The problem's the other thing though.

239
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,240
After that woman came...

240
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,940
for some strange reason...

241
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,340
For some strange reason?

242
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,740
President...

243
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,540
President...

244
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,440
Was he poisoned to death?

245
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,540
Yes.

246
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,040
The victim is Mr. Souhei Dejima, 54 years old,

247
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,340
the president of this design office.

248
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,940
He seems to have been eating his burger for lunch

249
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,640
together with the other three employees there,

250
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,540
when he suddenly started suffering and collapsed.

251
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,240
And who bought the hamburger?

252
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,040
I did.

253
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,140
Which means you had the most probable chance

254
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,040
of poisoning the hamburger.

255
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,540
Wait... wait a minute!

256
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
The president picked the hamburger on his own.

257
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,140
Besides, he picked up

258
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,640
the teriyaki burger that everyone else also ordered.

259
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,040
I couldn't have poisoned the hamburger

260
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,140
because I had no idea who would pick up the hamburger he did!

261
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,540
Is that so?

262
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,040
Right.

263
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,840
It could be that the poison was on something

264
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,040
that President Dejima always used.

265
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,840
Where is his desk?

266
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Here.

267
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,140
Whose seat is this next to him?

268
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,040
Mr. Imai's.

269
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,240
Then, he would've been able to use the poison

270
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,840
without being noticed.

271
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,040
That may be my seat, but...

272
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,840
Before eating the hamburger,

273
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,740
the president had eaten some cookies as well.

274
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,940
See that empty cookie packaging

275
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,740
next to the coffee cup on his desk?

276
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,940
I brought that from the kitchen.

277
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,640
Since he asked me to bring coffee for everyone,

278
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,340
I brought his coffee for him too.

279
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,540
I see.

280
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,240
If the poison was on something that the president used,

281
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,640
are you saying that he would've died when he ate the cookies?

282
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,040
What's this medicine?

283
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,340
It's medicine for constipation.

284
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,040
The president had a bad case of haemorrhoids

285
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,440
and used to drink it all the time.

286
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
I see.

287
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
However, he would over drink it at times

288
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,140
and get a bad case of the runs.

289
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,940
Yes, especially recently.

290
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,540
Yeah, he went to the toilet just before eating the hamburger too.

291
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,740
He had a stomachache and ran to the toilet.

292
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,140
The toilet?

293
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,040
Did anyone go into the toilet before the president did?

294
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,840
Well, I went in before I went to buy lunch.

295
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
I went in after him.

296
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
And after me, Mr. Zaitsu.

297
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,340
Then, after that the president went in,

298
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,040
came out and ate the hamburger?

299
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,540
Yes.

300
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,340
In other words, if you had put poison

301
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,640
somewhere around the toilet...

302
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,540
You must be kidding!

303
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,840
It's true that I went into the toilet before the president,

304
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,240
but it wasn't right before he went in.

305
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,940
Before the president went in, these children went in

306
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,740
right after me.

307
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,840
Conan?

308
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,240
And Ai and Dr. Agasa too?

309
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,840
Oh, well, we just happened to come by

310
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,940
because we had some business with Mr. Dejima.

311
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,240
You people sure get mixed up in all kinds of cases, don't you?

312
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,340
You're starting to look like Mr. Mouri.

313
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,540
So? Which one of you went in first?

314
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,540
We went in together.

315
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,940
What? You used the toilet together?

316
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,340
Well, I dropped my loose change somewhere.

317
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,040
I thought maybe it slipped through the space under the door

318
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,540
and rolled into the toilet,

319
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,440
so we looked for it together, right?

320
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Yes.

321
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,940
We looked for the thing that Akemi hid from the eyes

322
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,440
of the guys of the organization.

323
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,640
If so, where could the poison be?

324
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,540
Then, why not check all the way

325
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,640
from the work place to the toilet?

326
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,940
From the work place...

327
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,240
To the toilet?

328
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,540
After eating the cookies, the president went to the toilet,

329
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,440
went back to the work place, and ate the hamburger.

330
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,340
Then, he collapsed, didn't he?

331
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,140
This means that the poison

332
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,040
may still be somewhere around here!

333
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,540
Because from the time the president collapsed

334
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,640
to the time you came here,

335
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,840
nobody left the work place, took anything out,

336
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,040
threw away or wiped anything.

337
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,240
I see. Let's start checking anyway.

338
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,440
Yes, let's do that and check everyone's body.

339
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,240
What? There's no poison reaction anywhere?

340
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
No. Nothing was found from the toilet, corridor,

341
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,740
work place and everywhere else that the victim could've touched.

342
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,340
But the strange thing is,

343
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
there was a reaction by the right side of the victim's slacks

344
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,740
and the place where the belt holes are.

345
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,740
The same goes for the victim's left fingertips, his handkerchief,

346
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,440
and the wrapper of the hamburger he was eating.

347
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
But it was a very small amount,

348
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,840
and it seemed that the victim

349
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,340
touched the wrapper with his poisoned hand.

350
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,640
But why was there poison only on his left hand?

351
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,140
I get it! The handle of the coffee cup!

352
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,840
If the poison was put on the handle,

353
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,240
he would eat the cookie with his right hand

354
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,940
and poison would go on his left hand when he drinks the coffee.

355
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,740
If so, even if he went to the toilet after that,

356
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,840
if he opened and closed the door with his right hand,

357
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,940
there would be no poison reaction in the toilet.

358
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
In other words, the killer is

359
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,840
the one who brought him the coffee.

360
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,040
It's you, Mr. Imai!

361
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,940
No, Inspector!

362
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,840
We of course checked

363
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
the handle of the coffee cup and the cookie bag,

364
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,040
but there was no poison reaction.

365
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,740
Oh, is that so?

366
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,240
Besides, the lever to flush the toilet is on the left side.

367
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
If the poison was on his left hand

368
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,940
before he went into the toilet,

369
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,840
when he pulled his slacks up and down,

370
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,340
the poison would most likely be on the left side of his slacks.

371
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,540
So, why was there poison on the right side of his slacks?

372
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
I have no idea.

373
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,040
Did the president have some kind of habit?

374
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,840
Was he left-handed?

375
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,140
The only characteristic I can think of

376
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,440
was that he was very neat and loved coffee.

377
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,740
He was neat and loved coffee?

378
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,040
He always wiped his hands first

379
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,640
with wet tissue before he sat at his desk.

380
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,140
It took me 10 years

381
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,940
before I succeeded in making coffee the way the president liked.

382
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,640
Did you see any suspicious people watching this house?

383
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,440
No. We were burglarized twice.

384
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,140
But nothing happened after that.

385
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,540
Burglarized?

386
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,740
Yes. The burglar broke in through the window.

387
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,040
Ai, don't tell me that the burglary is...

388
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Yes.

389
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,640
It sure is similar

390
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,040
to the way those guys get rid of their target.

391
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,140
They leave no evidence

392
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,540
and vanish like the fog.

393
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,660
"Toilet equipment"

395
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,160
A shocking message is left for Ai in the next episode.

396
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,680
-How shocking is it? -Shocking enough to make you cry.
