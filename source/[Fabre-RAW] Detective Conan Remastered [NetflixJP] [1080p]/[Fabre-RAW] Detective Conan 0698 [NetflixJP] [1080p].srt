1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,655
In the morning of our day off,

2
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:05,255
in order to do our homework of sketching,

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,987
we came to the suburbs of Beika City.

4
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:11,991
-Hey. -Don't tell me that, that's a...

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,655
No doubt about!

6
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:15,995
That's indeed a UFO!

7
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,555
An Adamsky type!

8
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:19,655
It really existed!

9
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,355
Hey, hey.

10
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,755
Conan Edogawa.

11
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:24,003
Look.

12
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:31,755
What on earth...

13
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,655
Aim for a 100% solution.

14
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:38,017
Clear all mysteries and codes.

15
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,755
A UFO crashes and is found in the dry riverbed.

16
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,021
What is the secret that the victim hid?

17
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,555
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:45,655
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:47,555
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:34,133
"Unbelievable! UFO Crashes"

21
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:38,407
-Right now, we know that... -Officer Takagi!

22
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,807
You!

23
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:44,143
You shouldn't do this!

24
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,145
You're supposed let children into the site.

25
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:50,707
Well, but they insisted that they are your friends, so...

26
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:53,007
Friends maybe, but...

27
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,507
What an unlucky person, though.

28
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:57,707
To be crushed by a UFO

29
00:02:57,707 --> 00:03:01,007
that came flying from way out in outer space.

30
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,907
Hey... You shouldn't be here!

31
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,165
Did they find the spaceman that was on board?

32
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:09,007
Huh? No... Well, rather...

33
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,507
Did he get away?

34
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:13,807
I guess you would call it hit-and-run in earth terms?

35
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,907
-Yeah. -No, that's not it.

36
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:18,177
Hey, Officer Takagi.

37
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:22,181
The flap of his pocket is ripped off.

38
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:23,407
Yeah.

39
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,507
It seems he hooked it onto something and it got torn.

40
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,307
Rather, give me a break, Conan.

41
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,807
He's wearing clothes that pretty flashy.

42
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,407
Who is he, anyway?

43
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,307
Yes...

44
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:42,007
The victim is Mr. Osamu Iwabuchi of Beikacho, age 22.

45
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:45,607
The estimated time of death is around 01:00 yesterday.

46
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:48,807
He was crushed twice by that UFO and died.

47
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,207
This is all the information we have for now.

48
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,607
Now that you know, hurry out of here.

49
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:56,207
He was crushed twice.

50
00:03:57,407 --> 00:04:01,107
Two bruises in two separate places were seen on the corpse.

51
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,507
Well, on the 2nd bruise, there were no signs of life.

52
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:07,107
It seems he died from the first impact.

53
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,507
At any rate, I can't afford to have Inspector Megure

54
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:12,607
see me with you people.

55
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:14,907
I found it!

56
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:17,407
Here you are!

57
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,007
-Who is he? -I wonder.

58
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,307
I looked all over for you!

59
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:26,007
My flying saucer!

60
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,807
Hey, you!

61
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,507
Just what're you doing? Get down!

62
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:33,107
Give it back to me!

63
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:37,307
Give it back? Who on earth are you?

64
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:39,707
Me? I'm...

65
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:45,007
I'm Doctor Shozo Konuma, a physicist.

66
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:48,007
I worked alone for 30 years for this!

67
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:52,271
I absorbed all my time and energy for this flying saucer!

68
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:53,707
What?

69
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:57,507
You mean it didn't come flying from outer space?

70
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,007
Exactly!

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,707
It came from my research lab a little ways from here.

72
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:05,707
But it's still incomplete. I wonder how it flew over here.

73
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,707
How strange.

74
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:13,507
I'm part-timing at night at a convenience store.

75
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:14,607
To make money for this research,

76
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,807
I also went to work last night,

77
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:19,007
and when I returned to the lab this morning, it was gone.

78
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:22,707
Well, if the person who made it says it's incomplete,

79
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,303
there's no way it could fly.

80
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:25,707
-But... -But...

81
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,707
Doctor Konuma.

82
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:31,307
Wasn't that truck also at the lab last night?

83
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,707
That?

84
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,307
It's true that I always have it parked with the key inside it.

85
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:39,007
Because it's troublesome to look for the key.

86
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,307
Then, the story's simple.

87
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,007
That UFO didn't come flying,

88
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:46,907
but was brought here by someone on that truck.

89
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:48,327
I see.

90
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,607
Come to think of it, it's so simple.

91
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,707
What a waste it was to get thrilled over it.

92
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:55,307
But if it didn't come flying here,

93
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:58,337
why was he crushed by that UFO?

94
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:02,107
What? Did my flying saucer crush somebody?

95
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:05,207
We, the police think this is a homicide.

96
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,207
Homicide?

97
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,347
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:13,007
The culprit probably fainted the victim Mr. Iwabuchi beforehand,

99
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,207
laid him down in this dry riverbed.

100
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,807
Then dropped the flying saucer that he brought from your lab

101
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:20,707
down from the bridge.

102
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:23,207
-And twice, too. -My god.

103
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,107
But, Officer Takagi...

104
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:29,507
Why did the culprit go out of his way to use the flying saucer?

105
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:32,371
That's what bothers me.

106
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,373
At any rate, Dr. Konuma,

107
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,007
would you please take us to your lab?

108
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:40,907
I don't mind, but will you give this back to me?

109
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:44,907
I'm sorry, but it's a vital piece of evidence.

110
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,385
Just as I thought.

111
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:50,389
Okay, kids. Leave the rest to the police.

112
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,207
Yep!

113
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:54,407
We have to work on doing our homework of sketching.

114
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,407
Hang in there, Officer Takagi.

115
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:59,507
-Bye. -See you later.

116
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,807
See you.

117
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:07,007
Can you really make a flying saucer in a place like this?

118
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,907
True.

119
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:10,407
Why are you here?

120
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:11,807
What do you mean why?

121
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,907
Of course we came here to sketch this lab!

122
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:17,107
Is that so?

123
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:20,407
The exterior is probably shabby to protect secrecy,

124
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,421
to keep everyone else away from here!

125
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:23,607
I see!

126
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:27,607
Then, I'll bet the inside is full of super computers and such!

127
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:30,707
Okay, let's look inside then!

128
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,707
Yeah!

129
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:35,607
I wonder about that.

130
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,707
"Let the UFO fly to outer space"

131
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:49,507
How do you like my Konuma Flying Saucer research laboratory?

132
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:53,107
At any rate, we need clues to the culprit.

133
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,007
-Let's search. -Yep.

134
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,107
Right.

135
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,457
Where was that flying saucer kept?

136
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,307
It was suspended over there.

137
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:05,207
I wanted to dream of it flying.

138
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:08,107
He had it hanging from the ceiling.

139
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:19,407
It sure is rusty.

140
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,407
It probably broke off

141
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,107
when the culprit removed the flying saucer.

142
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:25,407
It seems to have been ready to broke off to begin with, anyway.

143
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:27,307
Officer Takagi.

144
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,907
Look.

145
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,407
There's something like this here.

146
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,307
It's not mine.

147
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,107
Just as I thought.

148
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:37,607
There's something that looks like a name here.

149
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,207
Mannen?

150
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,807
Mannen...

151
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,507
I don't know that name!

152
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:44,503
It's the culprit's hat!

153
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,807
The culprit's name is Mannen.

154
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:51,107
Conan. Over here.

155
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,107
-This is... -Yep.

156
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:57,107
It's his, right?

157
00:08:57,107 --> 00:09:00,519
I didn't see that piece of cloth yesterday, though.

158
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,907
Which means that, not only this person called Mannen,

159
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:07,107
but Mr. Iwabuchi who was killed was also here.

160
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:10,007
They probably came here together.

161
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,531
-Chiba. -I investigated and found that

162
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,307
Mr. Osamu Iwabuchi had a person

163
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:17,307
that he thought of as a brother, that he got along with.

164
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,607
This is the victim, Mr. Iwabuchi.

165
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,539
Yes.

166
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:24,907
And the other half of this odd couple is Sadao Mannen.

167
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,545
He is like a "big brother" to Mr. Iwabuchi.

168
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,107
-Mannen? -Mannen?

169
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:30,549
And these two were at a restaurant yesterday.

170
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,407
That's why I'm telling you that I'll pay off

171
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,807
everything I owe you altogether tomorrow!

172
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:36,907
Right, "Buchi"?

173
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:40,907
We're expecting big cash to come in.

174
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:44,107
It's highly probably that they broke in here last night

175
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,907
to search for valuables.

176
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:48,007
But if Mannen is the culprit,

177
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,569
why would he have killed his "kid brother"?

178
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,907
That too, but it's hard to think that

179
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:56,575
they came here to look for cash too, though, no?

180
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,577
True. No offense,

181
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,407
but there's nothing here that looks valuable enough to sell off.

182
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:05,807
There is! That treasure!

183
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:06,907
"Let the UFO fly to outer space"

184
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,307
I bought at the end of last month.

185
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,407
It seems to be the work of a famous calligrapher,

186
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,407
and cost me 50,000 yen!

187
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:16,595
-50,000 yen? -50,000 yen?

188
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,207
It was sold to me at this very cheap price

189
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,599
because the seller thought it was just the thing for me.

190
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,207
He was a man called Mr. Okura.

191
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,907
Well, that's not it.

192
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:28,607
Okura...

193
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,607
Do you mean Kinji Okura?

194
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:32,907
Yes.

195
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:35,407
Kinji Okura, the loan shark?

196
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,707
Yes. Mannen and Iwabuchi

197
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:41,707
were both hired by him as money collectors.

198
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,307
They were henchmen of Okura!

199
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:47,907
Is Mr. Okura a problem?

200
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,407
He's suspected of tax evasion.

201
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:54,907
The National Tax Office raided his place at the beginning of this month

202
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:56,907
for hiding assets in the billions,

203
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,307
but God knows where he hid it.

204
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:03,307
They weren't able to come up with the hidden asset after all.

205
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:09,207
So, that's the kind of guy he was, that Mr. Okura.

206
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:11,207
He's a money-monger.

207
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:15,407
He used to boast that anything under a million yen is not money.

208
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,407
-Strange. -Yeah.

209
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:19,607
I wonder if a guy like him

210
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:22,007
would sell a fake hanging scroll for 50,000 yen.

211
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,663
Then maybe the two snuck in here

212
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,907
by order of Mr. Okura?

213
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:32,107
No, Kinji Okura died the day before yesterday

214
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,207
in a traffic accident.

215
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,407
Huh?

216
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:38,107
But maybe he's not totally uninvolved, right?

217
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,007
Because the two people working under him suck into the place

218
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:44,207
where he sold the hanging scroll to.

219
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:47,007
It's true it doesn't seem like a coincidence.

220
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,687
Shall we go check on it?

221
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,707
The last people who saw Okura

222
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:53,207
at his death bed in Beika Central Hospital

223
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,307
seems to have been Mannen and Iwabuchi.

224
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,507
Okay, let's.

225
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,607
"Beika Central Hospital"

226
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,307
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

227
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:07,390
It's about Mr. Kinji Okura who was carried here by ambulance?

228
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,407
Could you tell us about his last moments?

229
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:14,713
But he was already unconscious when he got here.

230
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,307
He did say something strange just before he died.

231
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,107
What is it, boss?

232
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,207
U... UFO...

233
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:32,307
That was his last word.

234
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:34,733
UFO?

235
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,735
If you will excuse me.

236
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,737
UFO!

237
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,007
I got it.

238
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:42,507
I'm sorry, I have an emergency patient.

239
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:43,807
Thank you very much.

240
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,507
He was probably referring to that hanging scroll.

241
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:49,507
Huh? You...

242
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,607
Maybe he regretted selling something fake like that.

243
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,507
-Right. -Yep.

244
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,107
I wonder if he's someone that commendable.

245
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:00,759
Hey, Officer Chiba.

246
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,807
Mr. Okura loved money, didn't he?

247
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,607
Yeah.

248
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:09,607
The last words that a person like that would leave behind

249
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,007
would more or less be the same, wouldn't they?

250
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,963
Although Mr. Kinji Okura was thought

251
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:22,781
to have hidden assets of billions of yen,

252
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,663
they couldn't find it here in this office.

253
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:26,785
No.

254
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,563
Even his house was thoroughly search, too.

255
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:33,063
You said they did so at the beginning of this month, right?

256
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,163
And, just a little before that, at the end of last month,

257
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:40,163
Mr. Okura sold that hanging scroll to Dr. Konuma.

258
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:41,563
So?

259
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,263
A person like him who used say,

260
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:45,463
anything under a million yen is not money...

261
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:47,263
Would that kind of man go out of his way

262
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:49,863
to sell something for 50,000 yen?

263
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:54,163
He probably sold it because he had another purpose.

264
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:55,963
Another purpose?

265
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:57,663
Depending on how you look at it,

266
00:13:57,663 --> 00:14:01,463
you couldn't find a safer place than that lab, could you?

267
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,963
No robbers would attempt breaking in.

268
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:07,363
I see! Okura probably went to sell the hanging scroll

269
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,063
to hide his hidden assets?

270
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,963
He went to sell the hanging scroll

271
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:13,363
and when the Doctor wasn't looking,

272
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:16,463
he hid his assets somewhere in that lab!

273
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:18,563
As a temporary place of hiding,

274
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,863
that place where even a robber would stay away from is a safe place.

275
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:24,843
The hanging scroll was just an excuse to go there.

276
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,663
He could care less about the 50,000 yen for it.

277
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,363
-Right. -Yep.

278
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,463
And the last words of Mr. Okura.

279
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:36,463
U... UFO...

280
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:39,763
Talking of UFO,

281
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,563
brings to mind that UFO research center.

282
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:42,861
Mannen and Iwabuchi realized that

283
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:45,563
it was the place where the treasure was hidden.

284
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:47,463
They snuck in last night

285
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:49,463
to snatch that treasure away, then found it.

286
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:52,063
And although they got a long as "brothers" Sadao Mannen

287
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,863
who wanted the treasure for himself

288
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,763
killed Osamu Iwabuchi.

289
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,763
So, that's what happened.

290
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:02,563
If so, everything falls into place.

291
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:04,563
But you know, it's not everything.

292
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:07,463
Sort of.

293
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:10,363
Yes, sir. What?

294
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:11,863
Yes, I understand!

295
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:13,663
What's up, Chiba?

296
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,663
It's from the Beika police

297
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,895
where I asked to have look for Sadao Mannen.

298
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:20,463
They found that he is in debt with the people he works with

299
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:24,063
and is still running from them.

300
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:25,563
If he got a hold of billions of cash,

301
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,663
he would've returned his debt first thing, wouldn't he?

302
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:30,909
Which means, the treasure hasn't been found yet?

303
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,911
That's the only thing plausible.

304
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,563
But, if so...

305
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:37,863
The deduction that Mannen killed Iwabuchi

306
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:40,263
to take everything for the himself wouldn't hold ground.

307
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:42,921
Sadao Mannen has no motive.

308
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,963
If so, who took Osamu Iwabuchi's life?

309
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,363
I see!

310
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:56,463
Hey, hey.

311
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:58,937
Mr. Mannen is a mysterious person, isn't he?

312
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,939
He didn't look for the money until he found it.

313
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:04,463
I wonder why he stopped partway?

314
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,963
Did he stop partway?

315
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:11,663
He moved the flying saucer out at 01:00, you know.

316
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:12,963
That's right.

317
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,363
Maybe something that made him have to

318
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:17,563
stop looking for the treasure happened?

319
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,863
An unforeseeable occurrence, did you call it?

320
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,463
An unforeseeable occurrence?

321
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:24,763
I wonder if that had anything to do with the wire

322
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:27,963
that was holding the UFO up on the ceiling breaking or something?

323
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:29,763
The wire that it was suspended by?

324
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:32,763
It was broken. Only the one that was rusty was?

325
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:35,263
Besides, Mr. Iwabuchi was crushed

326
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:38,663
by that flying saucer twice, wasn't he?

327
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,663
He died from the first crush

328
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:42,463
and was crushed once again after that, right?

329
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,063
An unforeseeable occurrence...

330
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:45,963
The wire that broke off...

331
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,763
Crushed twice...

332
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:52,363
And Sadao Mannen has no motive to kill Osamu Iwabuchi.

333
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:54,993
Right.

334
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,363
Most probably.

335
00:16:57,363 --> 00:17:01,363
I see. This was not a homicide.

336
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:02,563
Yes.

337
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,663
Hey. Why isn't it a homicide?

338
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,005
I don't know.

339
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,007
The only thing I do know is that

340
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,763
the treasure is still hidden in that lab.

341
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:15,013
At any rate, let's go back to that lab.

342
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,463
Hey. You children should all go home.

343
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:18,663
But...

344
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,063
We left our things there.

345
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:25,363
Is that so?

346
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,025
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

347
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,863
How many trunks do you need to fill billions of yen?

348
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:32,163
It may not be cash.

349
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,863
It could be sticks of gold!

350
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,463
I don't mind you looking for it at all.

351
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:39,363
But when on earth did he hide it?

352
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:42,263
Mr. Okura never once came here, and yet...

353
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,063
What?

354
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,763
He never came?

355
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:48,263
But he came to sell the hanging scroll, didn't he?

356
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,563
No. He contacted me

357
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:53,663
and I went over to his place.

358
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,055
I heard rumors that you are developing flying saucers,

359
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,563
so I thought that the Heavens would punish me

360
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:01,059
if I didn't give this to you, Doctor.

361
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:06,863
It's as if it's been drawn just for me.

362
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:08,163
You think so too, don't you?

363
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:09,963
Please keep is as a household treasure.

364
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,063
50,000 yen will do!

365
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:15,963
And that's how I got a hold of this.

366
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,463
Kinji Okura didn't come here?

367
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:21,763
If not, he couldn't have hidden any treasure here, could he?

368
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:26,063
So that last word, "UFO" that Mr. Okura mentioned

369
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,963
was not about this place.

370
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,563
The odd couple mistakenly thought

371
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:32,263
that was what he meant and snuck in here.

372
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:36,463
If so, then why did Kinji Okura sell it?

373
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,097
To the point of calling him over,

374
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,763
for something like that...

375
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,363
So, that's the story.

376
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:49,763
It seems you've come up with something, haven't you?

377
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,263
Well, either way, that person Mannen

378
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,863
is probably going to come here tonight again

379
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:56,163
to look for the treasure, though.

380
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:57,663
No.

381
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,963
I don't think he'll be able to wait till tonight.

382
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:07,125
I've got to give it back quickly

383
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,963
or I'll be in hot water.

384
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:12,563
Not home. Lucky!

385
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,863
Mr. Sadao Mannen?

386
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,163
You also snuck in here last night too, didn't you?

387
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:23,463
Together with your "kid brother" Iwabuchi

388
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:27,145
to look for Kinji Okura's hidden assets.

389
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:31,763
But some unforeseeable accident happened.

390
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:33,863
Yeah.

391
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:36,463
I'm sure it's here somewhere!

392
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:40,063
Because this is the only place with a UFO.

393
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:47,463
My only good suit...

394
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:48,863
Who cares! If we get hold of the money,

395
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,663
you can buy as much of that stuff as you want!

396
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,463
True, I guess so.

397
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,163
What?

398
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:00,763
Buchi?

399
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,363
Are you all right, Buchi?

400
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:03,963
Buchi!

401
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:09,863
He was completely crushed and died on the spot.

402
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,563
I knew it was rusty.

403
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:15,193
And I was going to buy a new one

404
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,763
after I got paid for my part-time job.

405
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:19,197
It was an accident, wasn't it?

406
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,663
You couldn't make yourself continue looking for the treasure.

407
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:26,663
You couldn't leave the corpse as it was either.

408
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:28,763
Because if the corpse is found in the morning,

409
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,763
the police would rush over here.

410
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,763
If Iwabuchi is found dead,

411
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,863
you, as his "big brother" would also

412
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:37,215
be suspected as having been together.

413
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:41,863
Besides, if the police find the treasure during site investigation,

414
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,563
everything would go down the drain.

415
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:46,763
In order for this not to happen, you devised a plan.

416
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:49,563
By moving both the corpse and the flying saucer using the truck,

417
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:51,663
you tried to make it look as if

418
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,663
Mr. Iwabuchi died at that dry riverbed

419
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:58,463
to keep the eyes of the police away from this lab.

420
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:01,563
I was hoping that the crash landing of the UFO

421
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:04,063
would be thought the reason of his death.

422
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,163
But if you wanted to distract the eyes of the police,

423
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,663
there are other easy ways to do so, aren't there?

424
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:10,463
All you had to do was hide the corpse

425
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:12,163
where people wouldn't find it.

426
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:14,563
-I see. -If the corpse isn't found,

427
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:16,263
the police won't make any moves.

428
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:18,363
That won't do!

429
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,463
If he's not found, I can't give him a funeral, can I?

430
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:27,265
That would be too pathetic for Buchi.

431
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:32,063
But you understand, don't you?

432
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:35,273
You've committed several crimes.

433
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:40,063
Trespassing into this lab, dump job,

434
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:42,963
and stealing the UFO, a burglary charge.

435
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:47,763
I admit everything.

436
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:51,289
-Let's go. -Yes, sir.

437
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:52,763
That's right.

438
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:54,963
As for Mr. Okura's hidden asset,

439
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:58,963
there were jewels hidden in the shaft of the hanging scroll.

440
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:02,263
Mr. Okura's final word did not indicate the location,

441
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:05,303
but the UFO hanging scroll itself.

442
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:34,863
Now, I'll take you all home,

443
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:36,263
so go get your things.

444
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:38,763
-Huh? -What things?

445
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:43,763
We forgot to do our homework!

446
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,440
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,958
"Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano"

448
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,496
Hey, are you going to do it again?

449
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:53,411
I can't help it, can't I?

450
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,413
Well, I guess, you mean like this?
