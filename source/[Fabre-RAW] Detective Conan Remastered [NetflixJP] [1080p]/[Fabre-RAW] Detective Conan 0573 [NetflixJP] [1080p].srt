1
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:05,714
The haunted storeroom where anything you put inside it

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,314
disappears in no time at all.

3
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:11,314
We, the detective squad, revealed the secret and found the thief

4
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:13,714
who was hiding in the hidden room.

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,014
I couldn't help wondering why the deductions of Mitsuhiko and the others

6
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,914
were right to the point.

7
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:19,999
But it turned out that they were getting hints from Heiji Hattori

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,814
who just happened to stop by at the detective agency.

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,514
What on earth brought him here?

10
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:30,314
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

11
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,514
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

12
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:34,514
Kazuha's lucky charm that she put her hidden feelings into

13
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,614
and that she is keeping a secret from Heiji has disappeared?

14
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:38,414
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,314
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:42,314
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:27,797
"The Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 1)".

18
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:32,397
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Huh? You're searching for somebody?

19
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:36,135
You mean you came all the way to Tokyo just to look for somebody?

20
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,497
Right!

21
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,397
The person I'm looking for

22
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:44,143
is a junior at Teitan University, called Teruaki Kunimatsu.

23
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:45,397
It seems that his parents' house

24
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:48,497
is next door to Kazuha's house, so...

25
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:52,151
-Really? -Yep.

26
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,153
Why are you looking for him?

27
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:57,397
You see, he plays tennis.

28
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:02,161
But when Mr. Kunimatsu came back to Osaka last holiday...

29
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:04,497
Huh? A lucky charm?

30
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,497
Yeah!

31
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:09,097
Will you make one for me so that I can win the next tennis tournament?

32
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:12,171
Why don't you ask your mother to make it for you?

33
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,697
"Teruaki Kunimatsu (20)" -I want yours, Kazuha.

34
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:16,175
"Teitan University second-year student" -Your lucky charms

35
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,497
are rumored to be very effective.

36
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,297
I really don't want to lose the tournament that's coming up!

37
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:24,497
So, please! I beg you!

38
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:31,797
And? You missed giving the lucky charm to that guy?

39
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:35,397
No, I did get to give it to him,

40
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:36,997
but there was a mistake.

41
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:39,397
You see, this idiot!

42
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,697
Watch your mouth!

43
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,597
A mistake?

44
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:45,797
Yeah, the thing is...

45
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:50,209
The guy was in front of the Akido practice hall that Kazuha goes to,

46
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,497
and staring through the window of the hall.

47
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,213
I thought he was a lewd guy waiting to attack girls,

48
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:55,497
I was going to get him.

49
00:03:57,397 --> 00:03:59,197
You asked Kazuha to make you a lucky charm?

50
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,097
Yeah, she promised to give it to me today, but...

51
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:05,897
I don't think she can give it to you yet, for sometime.

52
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,097
Kazuha's got an Akido level up test coming up,

53
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:12,231
so she said she'd be staying till late for practice today.

54
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,597
That's why her mother asked me to bring this thermos to her,

55
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,797
so here I am.

56
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,397
Sometime ago, that dork over practiced

57
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:23,497
and collapsed from dehydration, you see.

58
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,797
But, that puts me in a fix.

59
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:29,897
It's about time I have to board the bullet train back.

60
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,697
I'll go get it for you, then.

61
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:34,253
If she meant to give it to you,

62
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,797
I'm sure it's in her bag.

63
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,257
"Dressing room"

64
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,259
Here it is!

65
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,297
This must be it!

66
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:44,597
"Lucky charm" -Don't tell me...

67
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:47,697
that the lucky charm was the one that you really cherished?

68
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:50,269
Right! It's the lucky charm that I also made for Heiji

69
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,397
with the piece of chain from a handcuff inside it!

70
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,297
And this idiot mistakenly gave that lucky charm away!

71
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,497
I couldn't help, could I?

72
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,497
I didn't know anything about the lucky charm, you know.

73
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,197
You don't have to know a thing about it!

74
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:02,297
Who on earth would attach a lucky charm

75
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,797
meant to be given away to the handle of the school bag?

76
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:06,797
What the fuss!

77
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:09,097
You made that lucky charm too, didn't you?

78
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:10,289
It probably doesn't bring that much good lucky anyway.

79
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:12,297
Just what're you talking about?

80
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,697
I always had it on me,

81
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,297
so nothing bad happened to me,

82
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,897
but when you lent that lucky charm to Conan,

83
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:20,299
you were shot and went through hell, didn't you?

84
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,197
Well, thanks to that lucky charm,

85
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,597
I was saved despite being stabbed with a knife.

86
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:28,307
Even the time you fell into the ocean!

87
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,897
Wasn't it thanks to the power of the lucky charm that you were saved?

88
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,197
That lucky charm could've been responsible

89
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,497
for my falling into the ocean to begin with.

90
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:36,315
At any rate,

91
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,697
if something happens to me because I lost that lucky charm...

92
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,297
Heiji! I'm going to curse you for life!

93
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,797
That's why I told you that I'd come to look for that guy alone

94
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:46,097
and get the lucky charm back,

95
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,697
so I don't see why you had to come along.

96
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:54,333
Well, so you see, that's because... Well...

97
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,997
Okay, okay. We'll all go to look for him tomorrow.

98
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,339
But why do you have to look for him?

99
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:03,797
You already know where his university is and where he lives, don't you?

100
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,397
Well, the thing is,

101
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:09,497
we haven't been able to get in touch with him since a few days ago.

102
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:11,897
He's absent from class at the university, too.

103
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:15,197
And it seems that he hasn't come back to his apartment for a while too.

104
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:19,497
In other words, his whereabouts are unknown.

105
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:22,361
I hope he hasn't gotten involved in some strange incident or something.

106
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:27,097
Well, you guys go over to his university tomorrow then.

107
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,397
"Teitan University"

108
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,097
"Tennis Club" -Kunimatsu?

109
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:42,381
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him around lately.

110
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:45,097
And haven't you heard of why he hasn't been around lately?

111
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:46,997
He was hurt.

112
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:49,497
He broke his right hand during practice

113
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:51,797
before the tournament.

114
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,097
Broke a bone?

115
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,395
Maybe he tried too hard and got hurt?

116
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:58,197
Just the opposite!

117
00:06:58,197 --> 00:06:59,797
He was acting absentminded

118
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,197
and didn't seem to be concentrating much.

119
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:04,697
He was so out to get before the holidays and yet...

120
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:07,197
Which means that Mr. Kunimatsu's been hospitalized?

121
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:10,197
No, his wound wasn't that bad.

122
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,297
But he couldn't manage to take care of things at home,

123
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:15,297
so he said that he'd be staying over at the place of a friend.

124
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:20,419
Yeah, I'm letting Kunimatsu stay over at my place.

125
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,697
I was telling him to get out of here as soon as he could,

126
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:24,797
though because the room is too small to accommodate both of us.

127
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:27,997
Then, is Mr. Kunimatsu inside?

128
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:28,997
No.

129
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:31,997
I told him that it's no use staying confined to the room all afternoon,

130
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,697
so to go someplace.

131
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,435
Then, he went out.

132
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,437
-Where to? -Beats me.

133
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,297
He used to like sports,

134
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:43,597
so maybe he's watching a match somewhere?

135
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,997
He seemed really excited when he called a while ago too.

136
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,497
-What? -He called?

137
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:50,449
This is just great! Luck has come my way at last!

138
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,197
I'll show you proof from now.

139
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:56,897
He told me to come to a sports cafe in Shibuya.

140
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,457
If you came to see him,

141
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,459
would you like to come along with me?

142
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,797
You don't mind?

143
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,497
Please take us with you!

144
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:06,197
And didn't that Mr. Kunimatsu

145
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,797
mention anything about a lucky charm?

146
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:12,897
Yeah, he said he had a girl who lives in his hometown make it for him

147
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:15,197
and he's been keeping it in his wallet ever since.

148
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,475
Really?

149
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,797
Then, you can get it back from him right away.

150
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:21,297
I'll go get ready then, so can you wait a while?

151
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,797
-Okay. -Okay.

152
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,485
Talk about a fast solution.

153
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:30,097
It's a bit too bad that we found him so soon.

154
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:31,197
Huh?

155
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:34,497
You came along because you wanted to stay with Heiji, right?

156
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:35,497
No, no!

157
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,697
Huh? That's not it?

158
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:42,501
Well, I guess there was a little bit of that too, but...

159
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,797
The real reason is that

160
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,505
inside the lucky charm...

161
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,797
What?

162
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,597
You had a picture inside it?

163
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:56,197
What about a picture?

164
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,797
I was just saying that this picture of Mr. Kunimatsu

165
00:08:57,797 --> 00:09:00,519
looks quite handsome.

166
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:04,997
If I let him go alone and get the lucky charm back,

167
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:06,997
he'd confirm it by looking inside, wouldn't he?

168
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:09,697
To be sure that it was really mine.

169
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:11,997
Then, he'll find out

170
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:15,997
that I secretly have a picture of him inside the lucky charm.

171
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,897
I came along to prevent that from happening.

172
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:20,297
If I check inside it myself,

173
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,197
Heiji wouldn't have to see it.

174
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:26,545
Okay! If Mr. Kunimatsu tries to give the lucky charm to Heiji,

175
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
I'll try to somehow get in the way.

176
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:29,497
Thank you!

177
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:30,897
But...

178
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:33,597
I might get flustered and give it to Heiji.

179
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:34,997
What?

180
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:36,097
Just joking.

181
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,557
Come on, stop being like that, Ran!

182
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,997
What's she getting all carried away about?

183
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,563
Maybe she's just happy that she's getting her cherished lucky charm back?

184
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,797
I can't figure out what's so good

185
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,571
about a lucky charm like this.

186
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,573
Talking of lucky charms...

187
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:59,797
Did Shinichi ever touch Heiji's lucky charm?

188
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:02,581
Remember, during the incident that involved the messenger of Death,

189
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,497
Heiji said that he checked Shinichi's fingerprints

190
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:08,587
that were on the piece of chain that was inside the lucky charm,

191
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:12,591
against the fingerprints of the culprit,

192
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,697
who pretended to be him.

193
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:20,097
But the one who touched the piece of chain that was inside

194
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,897
was Conan, wasn't it?

195
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:25,197
I'm sure he lent it to Kudo along the way, don't you?

196
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:27,097
It would be strange otherwise, wouldn't it?

197
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,297
True.

198
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,997
I'm sure it was a little bit up ahead.

199
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:39,697
There it is, over there.

200
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:41,297
That sports cafe.

201
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:44,097
What's up? Police cars are parked there.

202
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:45,397
Make sure no one intrudes on the scene.

203
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,397
Officer Takagi!

204
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,897
Conan!

205
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:50,997
Heiji too.

206
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,297
Is something wrong?

207
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,097
It's a case of assault and battery.

208
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,297
A man wearing a cast on his arm

209
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,097
was found beaten in the toilet compartment.

210
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,797
A man wearing a cast on his arm?

211
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,397
Don't tell me it's him.

212
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:05,697
Right, right. He looks like this.

213
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:06,645
Why?

214
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:09,497
If so, we're not outsiders.

215
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:11,397
Let me go check the site.

216
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:20,397
So, Mr. Kunimatsu was seated on the toilet seat?

217
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,897
Yeah.

218
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:25,297
It seems that he was bleeding from the head and slack.

219
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,897
And, is Mr. Kunimatsu alright?

220
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,597
He was taken to the hospital

221
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,097
and is unconscious in critical condition.

222
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:34,297
Oh, no.

223
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,675
Why Mr. Kunimatsu...

224
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,297
We don't know who and why he was beaten

225
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:44,697
but the time he was beaten was between 19:55 to 20:05,

226
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:46,685
during a period of 10 minutes.

227
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,097
Talk about precise.

228
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:50,997
Since today just happened to be the first anniversary of the shop,

229
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:53,697
party crackers were handed out to all the customers who came

230
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:54,693
and at 20:00 sharp,

231
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:57,297
they seemed to have held a simple celebration party.

232
00:11:57,297 --> 00:12:01,197
The employee began passing out the crackers five minutes before 20:00.

233
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:03,097
A party cracker was given to the victim who was drinking at the counter

234
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,097
and then was told about the 1st anniversary of the shop.

235
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:08,707
It seems he stood up to go to the men's room,

236
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,497
leaving the party cracker as is on the counter.

237
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,597
And, since even after letting off the party crackers,

238
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,597
he didn't come back from the men's room,

239
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:17,597
they went to check on him,

240
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,897
found a blood-smeared Mr. Kunimatsu

241
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,797
and called the police?

242
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,297
Yeah, it seems that the employee heard strange sounds

243
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,197
and groaning mixed with the sound of the crackers

244
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,397
coming from the men's room too.

245
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,497
Then, why didn't the employee who heard it

246
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,733
go to the men's room right away?

247
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,737
It seems he was busy retrieving the used crackers.

248
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:42,741
Then, were there any customers who left the shop during the ten minutes?

249
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,097
No.

250
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,097
Because it seems that

251
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,897
the cash register wasn't working well since before 20:00,

252
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,749
so the customers seem to have been stuck.

253
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:56,755
Which means that the culprit is still inside?

254
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,759
Yeah, that's why we're going to talk to each and every person here and...

255
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,761
There's no need to do so!

256
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:07,997
Maybe we'll be able to figure out who the culprit is right away.

257
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,497
How?

258
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,497
First...

259
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,697
Make the customers...

260
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,997
This is Officer Takagi from the Metropolitan Police Department.

261
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,797
You already know that just a while ago,

262
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:23,897
a case of assault and battery occurred here, don't you?

263
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:25,197
Before I start an investigation,

264
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:26,785
I would like to ask you a simple question,

265
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,797
so please close your eyes and listen well.

266
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:31,797
It seems that a small party was held

267
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:34,793
at this shop tonight at around 20:00.

268
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:37,197
Please bring me some evidence showing that such a party was held.

269
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:38,797
After I count to three,

270
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,297
please bring the evidence quickly and show it to me.

271
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:43,897
Are you ready?

272
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:47,197
One, two, three.

273
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:51,097
What the...

274
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,813
I see, three people.

275
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:57,397
Well, we sort of narrowed the suspect down, I guess?

276
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:10,397
Then, I will ask all three of you some questions standing up,

277
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,097
so please come this way.

278
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:13,697
Questions?

279
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,097
Why just the three of us?

280
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:18,497
Please explain, will you?

281
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:22,841
Mr. Kunimatsu went to the men's room at five minutes before 8:00.

282
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,297
After that, the employee here hears a strange sound

283
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,397
and groaning comes from the men's room.

284
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:31,397
Ten minutes later when he goes to check the men's room,

285
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:34,853
it seems he found Mr. Kunimatsu bleeding from the head.

286
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:39,497
Therefore, the crime happened at 20:00 sharp.

287
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:42,097
And so, what does that have to do with us?

288
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,863
Officer Takagi mentioned just a while ago, didn't he?

289
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:48,497
That a simple party was held at this shop at 20:00 sharp,

290
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:50,897
and to show him evidence of it.

291
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:52,297
To show him the piece of evidence

292
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:55,297
that everyone celebrated the first anniversary of this shop.

293
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,597
First anniversary?

294
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,697
The party crackers went off, right?

295
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,697
Because the employee was handing them out.

296
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:04,883
That's why I tried to show him the cracker that I got,

297
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,497
but it wasn't on the counter.

298
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:08,897
Of course you couldn't find it there.

299
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:13,497
Because the employee retrieved it right after the crackers were set off.

300
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,597
If you're a customer that set off the cracker,

301
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:18,497
you would know that the crackers were retrieved, wouldn't you?

302
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:21,497
That's why you tried to show the tape or pieces of paper

303
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:25,197
that were scattered over the floor, right?

304
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:26,597
Yeah.

305
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,697
The three of you who are standing here

306
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:33,697
didn't set off the crackers at 20:00 sharp with everyone else,

307
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,797
but for some unknown reason, are here,

308
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:38,297
making you suspicious customers.

309
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:42,297
These three are the suspects.

310
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:44,923
All the customers are free to go

311
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:47,297
after getting their names and addresses.

312
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,397
Yeah.

313
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:52,397
Then, get the names and addresses of the people who are bent over.

314
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:53,697
Yes, sir!

315
00:15:53,697 --> 00:15:54,933
As for the three of you,

316
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,797
please wait at the table as you are.

317
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:02,197
By the way, was the weapon that Mr. Kunimatsu was hit with, found?

318
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,497
Yeah.

319
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,945
It's the mop that was found in the tool closet in the men's room.

320
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,947
So, I think that it wasn't a planned act,

321
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:12,951
but rather, an impulsive one.

322
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,297
May I ask a question?

323
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:18,397
Didn't Mr. Kunimatsu have a lucky charm on him?

324
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:21,397
I'm sure he had it in his wallet.

325
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,297
Yeah. There was one, a lucky charm.

326
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:25,297
Really?

327
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:27,497
That's Kazuha's lucky charm,

328
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,597
so could you give it back to her?

329
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,997
No. Since it's evidence,

330
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:34,997
we'll have to check it thoroughly first.

331
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,197
If they check it,

332
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,977
they'll find the Heiji's picture inside.

333
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,997
No! Don't check it!

334
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:43,497
Hey! Enough already!

335
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,297
Mr. Kunimatsu is in the hospital right now

336
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,987
after being beaten and is in a life or death situation.

337
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,697
Who cares about the lucky charm at a time like this?

338
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:54,993
I guess so.

339
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:59,297
Talking of lucky charms... There's something strange.

340
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:02,197
The wallet that the lucky charm was inside

341
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:06,397
was found in the right back pocket of the jeans the victim was wearing

342
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:10,097
but his cell phone and cigarettes were also inside the same pocket

343
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,297
that was bloated to the fullest.

344
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:14,697
I was wondering

345
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:18,197
if anyone would put so many things like that in one pocket.

346
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,697
Maybe it's because his left hand was in a cast?

347
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:23,021
Since Mr. Kunimatsu broke the wrist of his left hand,

348
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:26,297
he could probably only use his right hand.

349
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:31,297
I see. That's why he could use only the pocket to the right.

350
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:35,897
But the right pocket of his top was empty.

351
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:38,697
Are you sure about Mr. Kunimatsu having gone

352
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:41,397
to watch a tournament this afternoon?

353
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:44,697
Yeah, because the night before, while going through the internet,

354
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,197
remarked, "I've decided on this tournament".

355
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:51,049
Then,

356
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,697
we may find out whether it's was so or not

357
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,053
if we ask those three.

358
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:58,497
If it wasn't a planned crime,

359
00:17:58,497 --> 00:17:59,897
the culprit would've had to most likely

360
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:02,597
start holding a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu today.

361
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:05,063
It's most likely that something happened

362
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:08,097
at the tournament that Mr. Kunimatsu was watching.

363
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:11,697
Besides, after watching the tournament,

364
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:15,097
an excited Mr. Kunimatsu called you, didn't he?

365
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:16,497
Yeah.

366
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:19,077
He said, "This is just great! Luck has come my way at last!

367
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,797
I'll show you proof from now.".

368
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:24,597
So, you were waiting for him at this sports cafe.

369
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:28,197
Yes, Kunimatsu told me to come here at around 20:00.

370
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:29,497
In other words,

371
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:33,091
the one who beat Mr. Kunimatsu up, likewise,

372
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:37,897
probably watched a very interesting tournament.

373
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:41,099
So, please give me your name

374
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,597
and why you weren't at your seat at around 20:00.

375
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:49,997
Then, let's start with you with the glasses on.

376
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,997
Yes. My name is Kazuo Satsuma.

377
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:57,797
"Kazuo Satsuma (51)" -I got to this shop a little after 20:00,

378
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:01,397
and didn't know they were celebrating its first anniversary.

379
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:05,123
-Really? -I'm not lying.

380
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:06,297
When I came into the shop,

381
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:09,127
the customers were clapping and excitedly making noise

382
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,797
that I figured something must be going on.

383
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:14,197
Since you came here,

384
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,697
I guess you like sports?

385
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,135
Yeah.

386
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,597
I like Sumo wrestling, so I went to watch today too.

387
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,143
See, that match!

388
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,797
Well, it was a good match,

389
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:30,797
but I'm a fan of Akashoryu, who lost,

390
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,897
so I was vexed.

391
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:36,797
So, you saw Mr. Kunimatsu who looked delighted watching the match

392
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:38,497
and held a grudge against him?

393
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,797
No, I didn't.

394
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:44,097
Did Mr. Kunimatsu like Sumo wrestling?

395
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:45,497
Beats me.

396
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:46,797
There was a time when he was watching

397
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:49,167
a live Sumo wrestling broadcast though.

398
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,197
I'm Kengo Haruto.

399
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:54,297
"Kengo Haruto (44)" -I got a call just before 20:00.

400
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:57,797
I figured it was going to get noisy with the crackers going off and all,

401
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,297
so I stepped outside the shop a bit.

402
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,897
Who was the call from?

403
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,597
I don't know!

404
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:05,797
It was a solicitor or something,

405
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:08,197
who went on explaining that I got pissed,

406
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,897
shouted and hung up!

407
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:12,497
And when I came back inside,

408
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:15,697
there was this fuss about somebody being beaten.

409
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,997
Since the cash register was out of order too,

410
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:21,197
I was seated at my seat, then the police got here.

411
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:23,797
Is the history of that call still there?

412
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:26,697
Yeah, because it was an unidentifiable call.

413
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:31,197
And? Did you go to watch any match today?

414
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,697
-Yeah, I did. -What match?

415
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:36,497
Beach volleyball!

416
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:38,897
It was a succession of close games and sure was a lot of fun!

417
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:42,997
Well, I did have my expectations of wardrobe malfunction too!

418
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:45,223
So you who were watching the players with a lewd look

419
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:48,597
got into a fight with Mr. Kunimatsu?

420
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:51,229
I didn't get into a fight!

421
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,697
Did Mr. Kunimatsu like beach volleyball?

422
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:56,597
Yeah, he likes it pretty much.

423
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:59,697
Then, finally, you are?

424
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:02,397
I'm Takuya Kyuma.

425
00:21:02,397 --> 00:21:05,243
"Takuya Kyuma (26)" -I wasn't at my seat around 20:00

426
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,897
because I ran out of cigarettes

427
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,697
and since the vending machine in the shop

428
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:10,797
didn't have the brand that I always smoke,

429
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:13,251
I went out to buy it.

430
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,797
And, when you came back after buying your cigarette,

431
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:18,697
there was a fuss, and the police were here?

432
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:19,997
Yes.

433
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:22,997
And? Did you watch any matches today?

434
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:25,597
Yeah, I did.

435
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:29,597
I watched the Tokyo Spirits vs. Big Osaka at the Tohto Stadium.

436
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,697
You were watching a soccer game.

437
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:37,697
Yeah, it was 1-2, an exciting game to the end.

438
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:41,797
Well, since I'm a fan of the visitor team Big Osaka,

439
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:44,897
I clapped inconspicuously cheering the teammates of Big Osaka

440
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:48,297
who were hugging each other on the grounds after winning the game.

441
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:52,497
If Mr. Kunimatsu were watching that match

442
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:53,997
and got emotionally carried away,

443
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:56,997
he would've had to be cheering for the same Big Osaka team.

444
00:21:56,997 --> 00:22:00,797
There seems to have been nothing to cause a grudge here.

445
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,301
Did Mr. Kunimatsu watch soccer?

446
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,597
He used to watch it a lot on TV,

447
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:08,097
but he didn't have any particular team that he favored.

448
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,311
I see.

449
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,697
What? It seems like you've come to something too.

450
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:17,697
Yeah.

451
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:22,897
The assault and battery case that occurred at the sports club.

452
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:26,297
While the first anniversary of the shop was in progress,

453
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:29,597
someone beat Mr. Kunimatsu up in the toilet compartment.

454
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,797
The suspects are the three who are in the shop

455
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,597
despite not having set off the crackers.

456
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:39,897
The answer leading to the real culprit is hidden in their testimonies!

457
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,800
Next Conan's Hint:

458
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,860
"Pocket".

459
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,034
Hey, Kudo, is something in the lucky charm? -Beats me.

460
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,720
Kudo? -No, no.
