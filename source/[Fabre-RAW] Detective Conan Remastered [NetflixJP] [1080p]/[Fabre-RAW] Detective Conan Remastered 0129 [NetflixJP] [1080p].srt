1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,080
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,280
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,180
Today is a 2-hour special program, of many mysterious being solved.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,080
We also get very close to meeting Gin and Vodka.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,580
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,880
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,580
I am Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

9
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,580
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend Ran,

10
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,580
when I happened to witness a suspicious dealing

11
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,280
being carried out by a man in black.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,980
Absorbed in watching the event,

13
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,280
I did not realize that another man in black was sneaking up behind me.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,180
I was knocked down, and forced to drink poison.

15
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,780
When I regained consciousness,

16
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,280
I realized that my body had shrunk to that of a child's.

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,780
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is alive,

18
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,080
danger will fall upon the people around me.

19
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,380
Through Dr. Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my true identity.

20
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,180
When Ran asked for my name, I instantly replied...

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,980
Conan Edogawa.

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,780
In order to gather information on the men in black,

23
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,280
I decide to free-load at Ran's house,

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
because I find out that her Father is a detective.

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,180
"The Mysterious New Student"

26
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,080
"Teitan Elementary School"

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Hey, did you hear the news?

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,480
A new student's coming to class today.

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,580
Really?

30
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,180
We haven't had a new student, since Conan came, have we?

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,580
I wonder what kind of person is coming?

32
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,780
I hope she's cute.

33
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,380
No, no, whether it be a girl or boy,

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,880
the main thing is personality.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,480
Hey, Conan?

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,180
What kind of person do you think will come, Conan?

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,880
I wonder.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Maybe a reticent bookworm type?

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,780
You think it's going to be a boy, then?

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Ayumi, you didn't get to see the student in the teachers' room?

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,180
No, but I got the name.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,980
It was Haibara.

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,180
Haibara?

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,280
Right. Haibara.

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
An unusual name.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,980
Not as unusual as Conan's thought.

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,180
Leave me alone.

48
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,280
Here they come!

49
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,080
Oh, it's a girl!

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
She's cute...

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,180
Sit down, everyone!

52
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,880
Yes...

53
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,780
What's the big deal over a girl.

54
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,980
Hi, everyone, this is Ai Haibara,

55
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
who will be studying with us starting today.

56
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,280
Let's all welcome her to our class.

57
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,380
Yes...

58
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,580
How energetic you all are.

59
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,480
Where shall we seat you, Haibara?

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,080
Mrs. Kobayashi! Over here, the seat next to me is open!

61
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,980
Here.

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,780
-Hi. -Hi.

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,780
What's with her? She's so stuck up.

64
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,480
She sure is cool.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,380
She's probably nervous.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,580
All right, everyone. Class time!

67
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,480
Yes...

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,780
Haibara.

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,080
Haibara!

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Let's go home together.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Okay?

72
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
Let her be! That stuck up chick.

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,580
But...

74
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,980
Where do you live? You moved here, didn't you?

75
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Don't be hesitant, we'll walk you home.

76
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Beika 2-22.

77
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,580
That 's where I live.

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,080
What?

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,180
What is it?

80
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,780
No, nothing.

81
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,480
Strange, Beika is my address.

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,680
But, there are no condos or apartments nearby.

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,380
I wonder if there was a residence called Haibara.

84
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,080
What's the matter?

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't tell me you have eyes for that stuck up chick?

86
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,680
No way. No darn way!

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,780
The Youth Detective Squad?

88
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,080
-You're members? -Yeah.

89
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
We work day in and day out

90
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,980
solving difficult cases by request of our clients.

91
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Why don't you join us too, Ai?

92
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,180
Is Conan a member, too?

93
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,880
Yeah, he's something like my henchman.

94
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,880
The requests all go into...

95
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,880
The requests are to be put in here.

96
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,080
We haven't told the teachers about it though.

97
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,480
They already know about it.

98
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,080
We get loads of mails from guys who have unsolved mysteries every day.

99
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
There's nothing inside.

100
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,980
Theres usually a lot of mails in here, but I guess not today.

101
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,680
You never have mail in there.

102
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,180
Let's hurry home and play soccer at the park.

103
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,380
Let's go, let's go.

104
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,980
Good idea.

105
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Hey, wait for me.

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,780
A request!

107
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,280
Really?

108
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,980
It says that they'll be waiting for us in grade 1 class A.

109
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,380
Then, let's go.

110
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,880
To grade 1, class A!

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Come with us too, Ai, quick!

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,380
What? Disappeared from home?

113
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,980
My brother suddenly disappeared.

114
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Don't tell me he's been kidnapped?

115
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,280
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
There was a similar case once before.

117
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Come to think of it, it really is.

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,580
Don't tell me that the brother of yours is a cat?

119
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,480
No! My brother who is 10 years older than me!

120
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,680
He disappeared a week ago at sundown,

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,280
saying he was going to drop by at his friend's house.

122
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,080
And he never came back since.

123
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
The police set out to search for him too, but couldn't find him.

124
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,280
I thought that maybe you guys could help me.

125
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,580
Have you received any threat calls?

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,880
Calls?

127
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,680
Nope, nothing like that.

128
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Maybe he just ran away from home?

129
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,180
He would never run away from home!

130
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,680
Because...

131
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,780
Because me and my brother, we get along really well.

132
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,180
But, your brother may have had his reasons.

133
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,080
Let's go over to his house.

134
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,680
We'll talk later.

135
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,280
Thank you.

136
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Okay. The Youth Detective Squad are on our way.

137
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,280
Let's go, Ai.

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,880
It's that house where the police car is parked.

139
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,080
Cool, a police car!

140
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,580
This is a standard police car.

141
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,980
But, it's been modified nicely like a police car.

142
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,880
Is that right? Which one's the radio?

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,580
See, it's the one by the passenger's seat.

144
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,980
I wonder if I can ask for eels over rice with that?

145
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,280
I'd like a pizza.

146
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Hey, hey, what did you guys come here for?

147
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,180
All right, if something comes up, please contact the station.

148
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,180
Thank you.

149
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,880
Thank you.

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,280
My, Toshiya.

151
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
-Are they your friends? -Yes.

152
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Hello...

153
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
Come on in.

154
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,280
Toshiya, would you like me to you something?

155
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,580
Oh, please don't bother, because we'll be leaving soon.

156
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,680
Oh, is that right?

157
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,180
I'll be in the kitchen, then.

158
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,580
I'm sorry. My mom's preoccupied about brother right now.

159
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,680
I know. Let's hurry to your brother's room.

160
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
All right.

161
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,880
It's so neat and clean.

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,280
Are we going to look for clues here?

163
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,480
Exactly.

164
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,780
This is...

165
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,280
This is cool. Take a look at this.

166
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,480
Super premium prices air shoes.

167
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,780
Don't you guys get something wrong?

168
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,580
Don't mess around too much.

169
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,880
-All right. -But now we know that Toshiya's brother

170
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,380
was knowledgeable of famous brand products.

171
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,680
Was your brother that kind of person?

172
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,380
I don't know.

173
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,380
But my uncle gave him those as a gift from the States.

174
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,080
I got one, too.

175
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,580
I see...

176
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,780
-Now we know that he wasn't. -That's right.

177
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,980
Hey, Conan, we're getting nowhere standing here.

178
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,980
See, so maybe he ran away from home after all?

179
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
No, that can't be.

180
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
See, this is your brother's wallet, isn't it?

181
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Yes.

182
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
If he's going to run away from home,

183
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
he'd at least take his wallet, wouldn't he?

184
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,180
So then, where is he?

185
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,680
He either got into an accident

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,780
or got mixed up in some incident.

187
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,180
Gosh.

188
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
What's with these pictures?

189
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,980
There are many strange pictures under the bed.

190
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,080
Talk about the pits.

191
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,780
See.

192
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,980
Who drew this picture?

193
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,480
Picasso.

194
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,780
What?

195
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,680
Yes. That's a copy of Picassos Crying Woman.

196
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,980
Gogh, Monet, Gauguin, Utrillo.

197
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,280
They all look genuine.

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,280
My brother drew all of these.

199
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,480
He was in the art club of his high school,

200
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,780
and was good at copying other peoples paintings.

201
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
Hey, don't tell me he's been kidnapped

202
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,580
and being forced to draw pictures.

203
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,880
That's possible.

204
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,780
If the masterpieces are copied and exchanged for the real ones.

205
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,680
No, that's not possible either.

206
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
What?

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,880
His sketches are indeed good,

208
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,980
but he needs a bit more practice as to color and touch.

209
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
It's not good enough to be counterfeit yet.

210
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,680
And this is not a kidnapping for ransom either.

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,180
Because if it were so, it would be easier to kidnap you

212
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,980
than to kidnap your brother who is in high school.

213
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,080
What bothers me is this painting.

214
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,680
What? I've seen him somewhere before.

215
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,980
It's Soseki Natsume.

216
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,580
Yes. My brother was a great fan of Soseki!

217
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,780
He liked that painting so much

218
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,980
that he even entered it in the community exhibition.

219
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,380
But, everybody was complaining about it

220
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,580
because was a copy of his picture.

221
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,380
Only one weird woman praised it.

222
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
A weird woman?

223
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,680
Yes, she was wearing a broad-brimmed hat

224
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,680
and dressed in black from head to toe.

225
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,580
When was that? When did you see that woman?

226
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,280
About 10 days ago.

227
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Were there any men dressed in black besides her?

228
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,080
Yes, there were two.

229
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,280
Don't tell me that...

230
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,080
What's the matter, Conan?

231
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,180
It couldn't be that...

232
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,580
That...

233
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,490
No...

234
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,890
Hey, take me to a place near here that your brother is likely to go.

235
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,890
His wallet and his train pass are in his drawer.

236
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,890
Even his bicycle is at the front door.

237
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,490
It's highly probable

238
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,390
that your brother was called out near here and kidnapped.

239
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,890
I see. So if we search the vicinity...

240
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,290
Maybe we'll find some clue.

241
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,890
Come on, hurry.

242
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,390
Hey, wait, Conan.

243
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,690
Conan!

244
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,590
A week ago at sundown?

245
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,690
I wonder...

246
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,490
I don't think she came

247
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,890
because I was at the shop all the time.

248
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,290
But, I don't remember seeing a woman dressed in black,

249
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,790
although I'm sure she'll stand out.

250
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,890
Darn. We've gone to all the places he may be called out to,

251
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,890
like coffee shop, game centers, department stores and back alleys.

252
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,490
There is nobody who saw him that day,

253
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,690
nor did anyone see the woman in black.

254
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,290
What am I getting all worked up for?

255
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,090
I'm sure the police already checked all the places he could be...

256
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,890
We have too little to go on.

257
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,490
Isn't there anything? Anything else...

258
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,990
Something will do.

259
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,290
Conan, would you mind if I stop by at the convenience store?

260
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,490
I'm thirsty.

261
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,590
It's so cool.

262
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,090
Thank you very much.

263
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,190
Hello, there.

264
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,890
It'll be 430 yen, please.

265
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,790
Thank you very much.

266
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,790
A Seven Mild.

267
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,990
Your change is 770 yen.

268
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,190
Thank you very much.

269
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,990
What's the matter, Conan?

270
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,390
He bought only one pack of the cigarette with a thousand-yen bill.

271
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,790
Strange.

272
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,290
Maybe he didn't have loose change?

273
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,390
If he had a thousand yen,

274
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,490
he could've bought it at the vending machine outside.

275
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,490
He didn't have to go through the trouble

276
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,190
of waiting at the check-out counter.

277
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,890
Maybe the cigarette he wanted was sold out.

278
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,590
Will you show me the thousand-yen bill that the man just gave you?

279
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,990
-What? -Just let me see it!

280
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,890
Hey!

281
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,890
There's no watermark.

282
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,590
Maybe he's...

283
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,990
What's with you anyway?

284
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,790
Conan? What's wrong?

285
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,490
Call the police. This is counterfeit.

286
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,790
What?

287
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,490
Hey, wait, sonny?

288
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,990
Wait, Conan!

289
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,190
Wait up!

290
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,590
Hey.

291
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,490
Conan, what's the matter?

292
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,090
What is it about the counterfeit

293
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,390
that you were talking about at the convenience store?

294
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,290
That man bought a cigarette with a thousand-yen, right?

295
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,290
He did so, although there was a vending machine right outside the store

296
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,590
and went out of his way to line up at the counter.

297
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,590
In other words, he used a thousand yen that the machine wouldn't accept.

298
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,290
A counterfeit that the human eyes are likely to overlook.

299
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,590
But that has nothing to do with brother disappearing, does it?

300
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,190
It has everything to do with him.

301
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,490
Do you remember

302
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,390
the portrait of a certain person that your brother had drawn?

303
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,490
Soseki Natsume.

304
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,590
Come to think of it,

305
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,090
the thousand-yen bill has the face of Soseki Natsume on it.

306
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,390
Then, is my brother...

307
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,490
Yes, maybe somebody saw through his talent for art,

308
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,690
and has him confined some place, forcing him to make counterfeit.

309
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,290
We can't be sure if that man is involved or not,

310
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,690
but maybe they're the guys who shrunk my body.

311
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,790
Those men in black.

312
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,990
Shrunk your body?

313
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,790
I'm only joking! Joking.

314
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,790
I was just teasing you guys.

315
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,590
What a fix.

316
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,790
I can't get them involved in such a dangerous case either.

317
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,490
I'll lose sight of the man if I don't hurry.

318
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,290
All right, then.

319
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,490
I'll use this, then.

320
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,790
Conan!

321
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,590
Hey, you over there!

322
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,890
You dropped something!

323
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,590
This is your thousand yen, isn't it?

324
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,190
Conan!

325
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,290
See. He dropped his money.

326
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,290
So, I came after him to give it back to him.

327
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,390
Oh...

328
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,190
It's no fun.

329
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,790
But what're you going to do about looking his brother?

330
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,290
It's getting late.

331
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,190
We've no choice but to come back and continue tomorrow.

332
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,390
You guys go on ahead to Toshiya's house and pick up your satchels.

333
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,390
I've got to stop by some place first.

334
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,590
What? Come back right away, okay?

335
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,290
Okay, see you.

336
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,590
Okay, then. I caught him.

337
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,490
That man took the thousand-yen with the transmitter on it.

338
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,190
All I have to do now is pursue him with these glasses.

339
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,790
Ai, hurry or we'll leave you behind.

340
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,090
He just may take me to where they... the men in black are.

341
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,190
The station.

342
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,890
A stand? No.

343
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,390
Yeah. That man wearing a black hat came here.

344
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,190
He bought a can of 110 yen coffee with a thousand-yen.

345
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,990
Gosh, just as I thought.

346
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,790
He wasn't friendly,

347
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,490
and besides there was a strange seal stuck on the bill.

348
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,090
He was a weirdo.

349
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,690
And do you know which way he went?

350
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,890
I'm not sure.

351
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,190
After he bought the can of coffee,

352
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,090
he was using the phone over there.

353
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,090
What?

354
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,990
He placed loose change on the phone,

355
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,090
and was talking on the phone until he used it all up.

356
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,890
For around 10 minutes.

357
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,590
Did he by any chance ask you to give him

358
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,890
the change in 100 yens and 10 yens?

359
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,890
Yes. But since I didn't have 100 yens,

360
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,390
I mixed 500 yen and gave him 890 yen.

361
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,090
The change that he got at the convenience store is 770 yen.

362
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,990
One 500-yen coin and two 100-yen coins,

363
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,790
one 50-yen coin and two 10-yen coins.

364
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,490
If the 890 yen change that he received at the stand is added,

365
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,190
the money that he can use to make the phone call

366
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,490
would be five 100-yen coins and eleven 10-yen coins.

367
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,290
That is, 610 yen all together.

368
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,590
If he had more loose change on him, it be more than that.

369
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,590
He used more than 610 yen for a call approximately 10 minutes long?

370
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,890
Was he making a long-distance call?

371
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,090
Could it be he went somewhere far away to the place

372
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,790
where his telephone partner is waiting?

373
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,890
No, if he calls from a public phone to a cellular phone,

374
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,790
it would cost 10 yen per 9 seconds.

375
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,890
There is still that possibility.

376
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,390
Hey, sonny.

377
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,690
Are you an acquaintance of the man wearing the black hat?

378
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,390
Yes, sort of.

379
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,890
Oh, great. Please give this to him.

380
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,490
What? 50-yen?

381
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,190
He was in such a rush that he forgot to take this 50-yen change

382
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,590
from the ticket vending machine.

383
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,690
Which ticket vending machine was it?

384
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,090
The one for the Tohto Line, over there.

385
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,290
Do you know which button he pressed?

386
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,690
I don't know.

387
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,790
He put in one 500-yen coin, and I saw a lot of loose change came out.

388
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,790
He put in one 500-yen coin, and I saw a lot loose change came out.

389
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,390
But I was more concerned about the rubbish at his feet

390
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,090
that I didn't notice anything else.

391
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,090
Thank you. I'll go after him.

392
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,090
-Bye. -Yes.

393
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,090
He probably got more than three coins as change.

394
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,790
If he inserted 500-yen,

395
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,890
and got chance that included a 50-yen coin and three more...

396
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,390
The station would be 500-yen minus 320 yen,

397
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,490
the answer is one 100-yen coin, one 50-yen coin,

398
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,390
and three 10-yen coins, making a total of 5 coins.

399
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,690
A change of 180 yen would come out.

400
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,690
It's Daitohma Station.

401
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Daitohma! Daitohma!

402
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
No good. I've come to Daitohma Station,

403
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
but nobody has seen the man with the black hat.

404
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
What now? Their purpose is to make counterfeit bills.

405
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,500
Maybe I should start off by asking at a real estate agency.

406
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,800
-A warehouse? -Yes.

407
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,900
Haven't you rented out a warehouse that is inconspicuous,

408
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,800
in the suburbs and won't be suspected

409
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
no matter what is done there to anyone?

410
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,100
No. We haven't rented any warehouse out recently.

411
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,800
It could've been many years in the past.

412
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,700
Gosh. You're getting in the way of business.

413
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Take your friends and go home.

414
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,800
Friends?

415
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,000
They're your friends, aren't they, sonny?

416
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,300
What?

417
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
You guys?

418
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,000
Do you think you can fool us every time with the same trick?

419
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,800
You really have a talent of running out on us, don't you?

420
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,900
How did you know I was here?

421
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,900
We came after you because Ai told us to.

422
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,200
She said that you were going to leave us behind

423
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
and pursue the man by yourself.

424
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,300
Right?

425
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,200
Mister.

426
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,000
-What is it? -Isn't there a novelist who lives near here?

427
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,700
A novelist? What do you mean?

428
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,800
After my brother disappeared, he called us once at home.

429
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,700
-What? -Why didn't you tell us sooner?

430
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,500
It's my grandmother who took the call.

431
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,300
She's hard of hearing and besides my brother talked so fast,

432
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,400
that she couldn't understand what he said.

433
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,900
All she could make out was,

434
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,100
his words, "I'm with a lot of people like Soseki".

435
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,800
He's with people like Soseki?

436
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
Soseki.

437
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,900
Did you tell the police about this?

438
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,000
Of course.

439
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
But they couldn't find anybody like that

440
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,100
no matter how hard they searched.

441
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,200
So, they said that maybe grandma made a mistake,

442
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
or that it was a crank call.

443
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,500
But, wasn't your brother a fan of Soseki?

444
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,100
If so, there's nothing to worry about, is there?

445
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,700
But grandma said my brother's voice was trembling

446
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,500
and cut off halfway.

447
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,200
I see. He somehow made the call while they weren't around,

448
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,400
but was caught after all and forced to hang up.

449
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,200
Come to think of it, a man who looks like Soseki does live near here.

450
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
What?

451
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,200
He's the owner of the bookstore on the corner.

452
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,500
His nickname is One-thousand-yen.

453
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,400
That's it...

454
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
Please...

455
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,000
-What? What do you mean? -Take us there...

456
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,700
No. I'd advise you not to go to his place.

457
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,200
What?

458
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,500
You've got to be kidding! Counterfeit my foot!

459
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,100
Stop playing jokes on adults.

460
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,800
Get out of here!

461
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,400
A thousand-yen, they said. I'm not that cheap.

462
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,300
Why isn't Soseki Natsume on the 10,000-yen bill.

463
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,700
He scared me.

464
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,600
That's why I told you not to come.

465
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
What's with that man, anyway?

466
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,100
He sure smells fishy.

467
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,800
No, he probably has nothing to do with the incident.

468
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,000
I checked the warehouse of the bookstore,

469
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
but there was no printer for printing out counterfeit bills.

470
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
Talking about printers,

471
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,900
the newspaper agency in front of the station was installing one.

472
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,100
A newspaper agency?

473
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,900
See, the building next to the police box. The agency is on the 3rd floor.

474
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,600
We handled that building 2 years ago, too.

475
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,300
What were the people in there like?

476
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,800
A lady who is always wearing a broad-brimmed hat

477
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,500
is the president of that small agency.

478
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,800
What?

479
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,000
But, they're printing out information magazines on this town,

480
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,400
not counterfeit bills.

481
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
They couldn't possibly do something like that here.

482
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,300
After all, it's right beside the police box.

483
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
So, that's the story.

484
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,700
I don't know what this is about, but it's already nighttime.

485
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,500
Quit playing detective already and head on home, you guys!

486
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,900
Could that newspaper agency be...

487
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,100
But, it doesn't have anything to do with Soseki, does it?

488
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,900
Rinse one's mouth with stone

489
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
and sleep with one's pillow in the water.

490
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,000
This is a famous ancient event that Soseki took his name from.

491
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,900
It means eccentric.

492
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,300
Normally we rinse our mouths with running water

493
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,800
and use stones for pillows, right?

494
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,300
But, to use it reversely, you'd have to be quite eccentric.

495
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,000
To make counterfeit bills,

496
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,800
one would usually want to go to the suburbs and avoid the eyes of others.

497
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,100
But, they deliberately situated their stronghold

498
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,200
in a bustling station front right beside a police box.

499
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,300
It may at first glance look to be the action of one who is eccentric.

500
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,500
But, there is no better way

501
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
than to use this advantageous location to blind the police.

502
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Toshiya's brother probably wanted to relay this message.

503
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,200
Which means that brother is...

504
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,300
If it's as I have deduced,

505
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,200
he is probably inside that newspaper agency.

506
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,200
That's why I've been telling you.

507
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
His brother's been kidnapped

508
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,900
and is making counterfeit bills in there.

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,400
Hey! You've been watching too many gang movies, kids!

510
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,100
It's really true!

511
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Please believe us!

512
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,500
Why would they believe kids talking like that? I wouldn't either.

513
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,100
Hey, you guys, don't move from there, no matter what.

514
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,500
You got me, right? Don't move!

515
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,100
Conan.

516
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,300
The more he tells us not to move...

517
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
The more you feel like moving, right?

518
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,400
What? Counterfeit bills?

519
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,000
Is that true, Shinichi?

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,400
Yes, although I have no proof yet, it's very likely.

521
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,800
And, please be careful when you raid the place.

522
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,100
They may threaten the hostages to save themselves.

523
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,100
A woman dressed in black.

524
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,400
Come to think of it, once...

525
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,400
once in the past...

526
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
No, Genta.

527
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Conan said not to move, remember?

528
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,700
Shut up! I've got to find some kind of proof

529
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,400
or the police won't believe me.

530
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,800
What? There's nobody here.

531
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,400
There are no counterfeits anywhere.

532
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,600
Maybe Conan made a mistake?

533
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,800
All types of ink. They were trying it out here.

534
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,000
Please forgive me, boss.

535
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,400
I thought I told you not to use that

536
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,700
because it was just a prototype with no watermark!

537
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,900
It looked so real that I just couldn't help myself.

538
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,000
I'll let you use it until you get sick of it in time.

539
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,300
Something way better than this half-done, Soseki Natsume,

540
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,500
A 10,000 yen bill with Yukichi Fukuzawa on it.

541
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,000
I hope you bought the ink that I specified.

542
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,300
Yeah, I bought all there was left.

543
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,000
I tried all kinds, but this is the best for the watermark.

544
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,200
Hey! Somebody's in the room next door.

545
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,100
Kids, five kids!

546
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,400
-Toshiya! -What the... What?

547
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,300
You stay put!

548
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,700
So, he came all this way to look for his brother.

549
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
How cute.

550
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,000
What? They went inside the newspaper agency?

551
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Yeah. All five of them saying that they'll come again

552
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,100
after they find proof.

553
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,800
-Darn! -Hey.

554
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,500
Those idiots.

555
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,700
They could be...

556
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,100
They could be...

557
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,200
in the same organization as the men in black!

558
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,390
I see.

559
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,690
So, we still don't know where she is.

560
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,090
Sorry, we're trying the best we can, though.

561
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,690
I still can't believe it.

562
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,690
It's hard to believe he'd disappear from there.

563
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,090
If his corpse wasn't there, it just means that he wasn't killed.

564
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,290
We've got to look for her fast and bring her before me.

565
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,690
We can't afford her talking about us to anybody.

566
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,690
Of course, I don't care if you get him dead or alive.

567
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,290
What? They went inside the newspaper agency?

568
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,090
Yeah. All five of them saying that they'll come again

569
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,390
after they find proof.

570
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,090
-Darn! -Hey.

571
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,690
Those idiots.

572
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,290
They could be...

573
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,490
Of all things, the Youth Detective Squad made it into the site

574
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,290
of where counterfeit bills were being made.

575
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,290
The woman with the black hat

576
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,590
and the gun that is pointed at the children await their entry.

577
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,990
Is she really connected to the men in black in some way? Or...

578
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,490
Conan runs up the stairs to truth

579
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,090
in order to reveal the mystery of it all.

580
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,690
He runs to save his friends,

581
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,890
as well as to gain his real identity as Shinichi Kudo back.

582
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,590
Darn, Genta and the others.

583
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,690
After I told them not to move from in front of the police box.

584
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,490
Hey, Genta, let's go back already.

585
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,490
If somebody comes, we'll be scolded.

586
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,790
Shut up!

587
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,790
If you wanna go home, why don't you go home alone, Ayumi?

588
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,590
It's seems like everybody is safe yet.

589
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,190
Okay then, I'll have to get everybody out of here now.

590
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,690
That's it for your detective game, kid.

591
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,390
What?

592
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,390
Hey, look at this!

593
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,590
A lot of 10,000 yen bills.

594
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,290
That's cool!

595
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,890
God know how much eels over rice I can eat with that much money.

596
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,290
But, there's something strange about these 10,000 yen bills.

597
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,290
Yukichi Fukuzawa's left eye is not drawn in.

598
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,390
It's like the daruma doll.

599
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,790
We're drawing in both eyes when our wish is granted.

600
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,490
And when that 10,000 yen bill is perfected.

601
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,990
Who are you guys?

602
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,490
How's about a touching reunion of the two brothers?

603
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,790
Toshiya!

604
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,590
Brother! Brother!

605
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,590
Toshiya!

606
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,690
Hey, cut it out, you guys!

607
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,990
That's right, I'll contact Conan.

608
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,990
-What do you think you're doing? -Let her go!

609
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,390
Shut up! You don't seem to know what this is, do you?

610
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,990
Don't you dare touch the children!

611
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,390
If you do, I won't cooperate with you anymore.

612
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,290
Don't worry, I'll save your little brother for last.

613
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,990
Bring the girl with the headband here.

614
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,890
Ayumi!

615
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,490
Hey, what're you going to do?

616
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,490
I'm going to make you speed your work up.

617
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,890
If they die one after the other,

618
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,290
maybe you'll want to work harder?

619
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,890
Help, Conan!

620
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,990
Conan?

621
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,990
If it's that boy with glasses that were loitering around the stairs,

622
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,490
he's already dead.

623
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,390
Conan's dead?

624
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,790
No way.

625
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,190
It's a lie!

626
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,590
There is only one way in and out of this building!

627
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,490
When can you kill him?

628
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,690
The surveillance camera was watching all of you all this time.

629
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,790
The outside stairway is also guarded.

630
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,390
You didn't know, did you?

631
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,190
I had Inuyama come all the way around to this entrance

632
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,490
from the emergency exit so that you guys wouldn't be able to run away.

633
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,690
Just then, the boy with the glasses came along, so I killed him.

634
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,190
Hey, come on, don't cry.

635
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,290
You'll be just fine. I'll let you go to him right away.

636
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,790
Bye, bye, young lady.

637
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,090
No!

638
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,890
Who is it?

639
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,690
Same as the daruma doll, you say?

640
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,190
What a laugh!

641
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,490
Yukichi Fukuzawa's eye is not drawn in

642
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,690
because the sculptor that was carving him got hurt.

643
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,890
What?

644
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,190
See, the man over there with the white beard and his hand wrapped up.

645
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,990
He's the real sculptor, isn't he?

646
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,790
You panicked and made Toshiya's brother take his place

647
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,390
because the sculptor got hurt just before completion.

648
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,290
After seeing his talent for art at the exhibition,

649
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,790
you lured him out and confined him here.

650
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,790
The ink beside the printer,

651
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,490
and the container with magnetic steel powder inside it.

652
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,990
Seeing that you've got all these prepared.

653
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,290
I'll bet you're going to put it through a machine next?

654
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,790
You plan to pass it through the counterfeit detection machine,

655
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,490
and use these counterfeits that are difficult to detect even by appearance

656
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,090
through the change machines of banks, game centers, and pachinko parlors,

657
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,290
to change them in large amounts.

658
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,990
By the time your deed is made public,

659
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,590
you plan to be some place far away.

660
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,290
Isn't that right, lady in the black hat?

661
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,090
Who...

662
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,490
who are you?

663
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,990
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

664
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,390
Conan!

665
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,590
It can't be. Inuyama got rid of you.

666
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,790
Oh, so this dog of a man is called Inuyama?

667
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:37,590
I'm sorry, but I put him to sleep with an anesthetic gun.

668
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,190
Anesthetic gun?

669
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,690
Oh, yes, yes.

670
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,190
The gun I threw at you a while ago was Inuyama's gun.

671
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,090
I kicked it right at you.

672
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,090
Kicked it?

673
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,290
Yes, with this super kick shoe.

674
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,590
There!

675
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,190
Ai Haibara?

676
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,500
Cool.

677
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,200
You're fantastic, Ai.

678
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,800
You're just too much.

679
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,200
This is the first time I've ever seen a real gun.

680
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,300
She...

681
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,600
Well, at any rate, I'm glad.

682
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,900
Brother!

683
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Toshiya.

684
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,800
So, now I guess the case is closed.

685
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,100
I'm glad!

686
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,600
Aye! The Youth Detective Squad's great victory!

687
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,800
Is anything the matter?

688
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,000
Thanks for coming. The case has been solved!

689
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,900
This is the counterfeit, which is evidence.

690
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,500
And that's Toshiya's brother, the one who was kidnapped.

691
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,700
Hello.

692
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,400
They were telling the truth.

693
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,700
Leave it to the Youth Detective Squad,

694
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,500
and cases are solved in a jiffy...

695
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,100
Right, Conan?

696
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
Yes.

697
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,300
Being reckless like this, we'll need more than nine lives.

698
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,800
Twenty minutes later, Inspector Megure arrived.

699
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,300
They were all taken away,

700
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,700
and Toshiya's brother was set free.

701
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,000
And...

702
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,800
What a goof, to be arrested over such a measly crime.

703
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
You may as well spit it all out at the station.

704
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,100
About the big organization

705
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,800
that is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

706
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,200
Organization?

707
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,700
Don't play dumb with me.

708
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,400
You also had code names like "Gin" and "Vodka", didn't you?

709
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,100
Gin, Vodka?

710
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm sorry, but I quit drinking quite some time ago.

711
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,700
Hey, hey, just what are you talking about, Conan?

712
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,200
These people are notorious for making counterfeit bills

713
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,000
and go by the name "Silver Fox".

714
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Although she's fixed up a bit by plastic surgery,

715
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,400
I would never forget the face of this woman boss.

716
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,600
But, this time you'll have to serve for kidnapping,

717
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
possession of dangerous weapons, and firing a gun, too.

718
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,500
You'll be spending some time in jail this time.

719
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,400
My, I'm not the one who fired the gun.

720
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,600
It's that girl with the brown hair over there.

721
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,200
What?

722
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,400
What a dangerous thing to do?

723
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,900
But... Because...

724
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,700
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have scolded you.

725
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,400
So, she's a girl after all.

726
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Hey, don't cry.

727
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,800
Your house is near here, isn't it?

728
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,000
Gosh, why me?

729
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm thrower off finding out that those people dressed in black were not the people I was after,

730
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,600
and why do I have to baby-sit a crying girl,

731
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,800
moreover, walk her home.

732
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,300
Hey, you can go home alone from here, can't you?

733
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,300
See you tomorrow...

734
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,800
at school, then.

735
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,400
APTX 4869.

736
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,000
-What? -Do you know what it is?

737
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,400
It's the name of the medicine you were given.

738
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,900
What're you talking about?

739
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,900
I've never been given such a strange medicine.

740
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,500
Oh, I'm sure that the name of the medicine is not wrong

741
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,000
because I'm the one who made it...

742
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,500
by order of the organization.

743
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,100
Organization? Made it?

744
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,700
A child like you could never do.

745
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,400
I drank it just like you did.

746
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,600
Through the accidental effects of the self-destructive program of the cells,

747
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,300
everything from bone structure, muscles,

748
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,400
internal organs, to bodily hair, all but the nervous system,

749
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,500
regress to that of the childhood years.

750
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,000
It sure is a mystical poison.

751
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Haibara, don't tell me you're...

752
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
It's not Haibara.

753
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,300
It's Sherry.

754
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,300
This is my code name.

755
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,400
Well? Surprised?

756
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,000
Shinichi Kudo.

757
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,300
Then, you're a member of the organization of the men in black.

758
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,000
You've got no time to be surprised, slowpoke detective.

759
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,800
What?

760
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,800
Didn't I tell you that I live at Beika 2-22 now.

761
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,000
Yes, next door to your real house.

762
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,900
You know where it is, don't you?

763
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,200
It couldn't be...

764
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,000
Dr. Agasa's house?

765
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Hey, Dr. Agasa!

766
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,100
-Answer the phone! -No use.

767
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,300
No matter how much you call, you'll get a busy signal.

768
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,200
The phone is off the hook, he can't pick it up.

769
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,500
That's because he is no longer of this world.

770
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,100
Why you...

771
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,660
Why you...

772
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,260
What did you do to him?

773
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,260
Will you be in trouble if he isn't around, after all?

774
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,360
That phone.

775
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,760
The super kick shoe.

776
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,260
They are all things that the doctor made for you, aren't they?

777
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,160
With the cooperation of the doctor,

778
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,460
you can be playing your role as youth detective with that body of yours.

779
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,360
In other words, Dr. Agasa is the lifeline

780
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,460
for the present Shinichi Kudo.

781
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,960
Is that why you killed him?

782
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Well, I wonder?

783
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
If it bothers you,

784
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,260
why don't you go over to his house and see for yourself?

785
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,360
Darn!

786
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,460
Dr. Agasa, please be okay.

787
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Maybe the men in black are still inside.

788
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,960
Nothing seems to be different from the usual.

789
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,060
It doesn't seem like the men in black are here.

790
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,060
Doctor!

791
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,360
Dr. Agasa!

792
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,160
I thought I heard Shinichi's voice?

793
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,060
Shinichi, what is it?

794
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,360
Do you need anything?

795
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,160
Dr. Agasa. So, you're okay?

796
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,960
Okay? What's up?

797
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,860
Oh, I'm really sorry, truly I am!

798
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,860
I've been into working with the computer recently,

799
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,960
that I guess the telephone line was busy.

800
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,860
I'm home.

801
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,860
Welcome back, Ai.

802
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,160
How was school?

803
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
It was quite fun.

804
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,060
That brat, she deceived me.

805
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,560
Well, you can't blame her

806
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,260
for the fact that you didn't know my address.

807
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:44,360
How should I know? I never sent anything to your house.

808
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,760
I even brought the New Year's greeting card over in person.

809
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,660
Never mind that. Who on earth is she?

810
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,660
What? Didn't she tell you?

811
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,660
That she is a member of the black organization,

812
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,560
drank the same poison as you and became small.

813
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,260
Strange.

814
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,160
She told me she'd tell you herself, so not to say anything to you.

815
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,560
Wait, Dr. Agasa.

816
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,960
Oh, I thought up the name Ai Haibara with her.

817
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,660
We took it from the name of a woman detective.

818
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,060
The "Hai" of her name meaning "gray" in Japanese,

819
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,360
was taken from Cordelia Gray.

820
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,960
"Ai" was taken from the "I" in Vioshosky.

821
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,660
I advised her that the Japanese character for love "Ai"

822
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,660
would be cuter than the "Ai" of the character for sadness.

823
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,760
That's not my question!

824
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,160
Why is a woman involved with the men in black living in your house?

825
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,860
I was collapsed...

826
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,160
outside your house in the rain,

827
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,360
when he...

828
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,060
Dr. Agasa found me.

829
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,760
In front of my house?

830
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,260
Did you know?

831
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,860
The organization had sent investigators to your house about twice.

832
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,760
Out of the people who drank that poison,

833
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,260
only your death wasn't verified.

834
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,460
I, the inventor of the poison, naturally came along on the investigation.

835
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,760
But, the house was dusty

836
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,960
and there didn't seem to be anyone living there,

837
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,860
so the first time, we left right away.

838
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,160
We went on our second investigation a month later.

839
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,760
It was a dusty as usual,

840
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,660
and it didn't seem different from what we saw before.

841
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,060
I was starting to think that you had died after all.

842
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:31,760
I got chicken skin when I saw the strange thing in your clothes drawer.

843
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,260
Your childhood days clothes that were in the drawer a month ago was gone.

844
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,060
A whole lot of it, too.

845
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,860
During the stage of animal experiment,

846
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,760
only one mouse regressed to childhood without dying,

847
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,060
so it was easy to establish the following hypothesis.

848
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,560
The possibility that Shinichi Kudo was given APTX 4869,

849
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,360
and regressed, becoming a child!

850
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,960
The guys of the organization know of my having become a child, then?

851
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,260
Thank me. I rewrote "Confirmed dead" on your data.

852
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,960
I decided to let you live

853
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,760
because you're a very interesting research material.

854
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,560
If I report you to the organization,

855
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,360
the chances of you being killed before getting to me are greater.

856
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,560
Well, if they find out that the one who rewrote your data

857
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,860
is me, the one who betrayed them,

858
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,760
they may start getting suspicious again.

859
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,660
Betrayed?

860
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,760
Yes.

861
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,260
One of the reasons why I gave that poison

862
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,560
that was still in the testing stage, to a human on my own accord,

863
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,760
was because I was getting sick of them.

864
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,260
But, an even greater reason, was my older sister.

865
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,860
Older sister?

866
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,860
She was killed.

867
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,760
She was killed by the hands of the men of the organization.

868
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,460
No matter how much I asked them,

869
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,260
they wouldn't tell me why they killed her.

870
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,460
And, I went against them saying that I was going to postpone my research

871
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,460
until they gave me a formal explanation.

872
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,460
Naturally, since I went against the organization,

873
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,760
they confined me to a certain room in the lab.

874
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,760
I was to wait until the higher-ups decided what to do with me.

875
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,560
Thinking that I may as well drink the poison

876
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,960
if I was going to be killed anyway,

877
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,960
I drank the APTX 4869 that I had hidden on me.

878
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,860
Fortunately, the poison I took in an attempt to kill myself...

879
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,060
transformed my body to that of a children's body,

880
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,460
and freed me from the handcuffs that were on me.

881
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,860
And, I escaped from the tiny dust Shute.

882
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,760
Having no place to go,

883
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,960
the only person I could think of going to

884
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,660
was you, Shinichi Kudo.

885
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,360
I figured since we were in the same boat,

886
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,260
you'd be able to understand my predicament.

887
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,660
You've got to be kidding!

888
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,760
Just how am I supposed to understand

889
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,260
somebody who made poison to kill people?

890
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,860
Hey, Shinichi.

891
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,760
Do you know what you did?

892
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,660
Are you aware of just how many people died

893
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,860
because of the poison you invented?

894
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,360
I couldn't help it.

895
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,460
I had no intention of making poison.

896
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,560
-What? -Well, come now.

897
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,760
She left the organization already.

898
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,060
Since she's the one who made the poison,

899
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,360
she could come up with an antidote without difficulty too, right?

900
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,960
The data for the poison is all in the research lab.

901
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,260
I couldn't possibly remember such a massive amount of data!

902
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,560
Darn.

903
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,660
Tell me where that research lab is, then.

904
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,860
No use.

905
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,460
Look at the evening paper three days ago.

906
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,760
This is about the mysterious fire

907
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,860
that burned down the pharmaceutical company.

908
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,160
So, there would be nothing left even if we go there.

909
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,260
My God.

910
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,660
The organization got rid of it

911
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,460
fearing that I would talk about it to someone.

912
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,960
At this rate, every facility that I was involved in would be closed down.

913
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Which means that those guys are after you?

914
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,760
Yes, they're probably going berserk looking for me.

915
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,360
Without even knowing that I've transformed this way.

916
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,060
But, if they keep using this poison to kill people,

917
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,160
there is no guarantee that people

918
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,260
who will regress like us will eventually appear.

919
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,660
Then, the organization who has a picture of my childhood days

920
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,860
will definitely find me.

921
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,860
What will you do about it?

922
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,260
Will you chase me out of here because I pose a threat to all of you?

923
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,360
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

924
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,140
What will you do about it?

925
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,040
Will you chase me out of here because I pose a threat to all of you?

926
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,040
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

927
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,840
Yes. I made the poison and am an accomplice to murder.

928
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,740
The organization is also after me.

929
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,840
I am an extremely dangerous person to have around.

930
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,940
There's no reason why you should keep me near you.

931
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,040
Don't be silly. If they find out about you,

932
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,040
it'll be a matter of time before they find out about me,

933
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,740
I hate to impose on Dr. Agasa,

934
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,040
but I'll have you stay here as a grade schooled whether you like it or not.

935
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,140
It's more bothersome to have you hanging around outside.

936
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,440
Oh my, how nice of you.

937
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,440
How about the safety of your parents?

938
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,040
No need for worry, they are also members of the organization.

939
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,040
I was told they died of an accident soon after I was born.

940
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,940
Which means your family is?

941
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,540
Me and my older sister who I didn't get to see too often.

942
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:43,340
Unlike me, who was studying the States through orders of the organization.

943
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,140
My sister was constantly under surveillance

944
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,640
because she was living in Japan.

945
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,840
Yes, until my sister started working for the organization,

946
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,340
in an attempt to set me free of them,

947
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,340
she was going to an ordinary school,

948
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,540
had ordinary friends, went on ordinary trips.

949
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,140
Wait.

950
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,140
Come to think of it, several years before she was killed.

951
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,140
She sent me 2 or 3 floppies with pictures

952
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,840
of when she went on a trip.

953
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,440
I looked through them at the research lab

954
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,840
and sent it back to her right away,

955
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,640
but the floppy that I had the data of the poison in,

956
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
got lost after that.

957
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,440
I looked all over for it but couldn't find it.

958
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,840
I see.

959
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,440
So, the floppy with the data of the poison

960
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,840
may be mixed up among the floppies that you sent back to your sister.

961
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,140
So, if we search the place where your sister used to live.

962
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,840
No use. The condo that my sister was living in

963
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,340
was gotten rid of by the organization right after her death,

964
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,740
and everything was cleared out.

965
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,040
But she said that the person who put the pictures into the floppies,

966
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,740
was the professor that went on the trip together with her.

967
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,940
So, maybe...

968
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,940
You don't know who that professor is?

969
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,740
Masami Hirota of Nanyo University.

970
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,040
Masami Hirota?

971
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,740
But, I don't know where he lives.

972
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,740
All we have to do is ask at the university.

973
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,440
All right!

974
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,640
Let's get with it right away.

975
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,540
Hello.

976
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,940
Could you look up the phone number to Nanyo University, please?

977
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,940
What? The floppy with the picture of the trip in it?

978
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,740
Who are you?

979
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,940
Oh, well, you see, I'm...

980
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,840
What's your sister's name?

981
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,340
Akemi.

982
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,840
Akemi Miyano.

983
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,140
I'm an acquaintance of Akemi.

984
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,440
If it's the floppies with the pictures of the trip

985
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,640
that I went with them, she gave them back to me.

986
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,640
A strange floppy seems to have been mixed up among them, though.

987
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,340
A strange floppy?

988
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,840
No doubt about it! That's the one!

989
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,640
Is it all right for us to go and pick up that floppy from now?

990
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,340
Yes, I don't mind.

991
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,040
I'm expecting a few guests soon,

992
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,740
but if you don't mind coming after them.

993
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,540
Then, we'll be there in three hours.

994
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,540
What? You're going to stay over at Dr. Agasa's?

995
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,140
What on earth are you doing?

996
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,240
Dinner's ready, and we've been waiting for you to come home, Conan.

997
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,340
Dr. Agasa says that he made an interesting game

998
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,740
and wants me to play it with him!

999
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,040
I'll be home by tomorrow morning.

1000
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,840
I'm sorry, Ran.

1001
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
Wait.

1002
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,540
You're sure good at acting like a child.

1003
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,340
Yeah. But, I'm not as good as you who can fake crying like a baby.

1004
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,540
It's 150 kilometers to Shizuoka.

1005
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,640
I wonder if we can get there in three hours.

1006
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,440
Hey, Dr. Agasa, be on your guard with that chick.

1007
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,740
That chick? You mean Ai?

1008
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,340
Yeah, although she's saying she fled from the organization,

1009
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,540
she's not telling us her real name or age,

1010
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,740
and even if we ask her what the organization is after,

1011
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,540
she insists on not knowing a thing.

1012
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,740
What she said a while ago

1013
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:14,340
could be a lie to lure us into a trap.

1014
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,140
She doesn't look that way, though.

1015
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,040
And, another thing that bothers me is, Masami Hirota.

1016
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,640
I've heard this name somewhere before.

1017
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,340
Good evening.

1018
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,440
Oh, Mr. Agasa.

1019
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,240
My husband told me about you. Please come in.

1020
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,140
Have your guests already left?

1021
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,140
Yes, it seems that my husband's student was here just before you.

1022
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,040
Dear!

1023
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,740
Dear.

1024
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,940
Strange, I wonder what he's doing inside with the door locked?

1025
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,640
Darn, it won't open.

1026
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,440
Do you have a spare key to this room?

1027
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,040
No, I haven't.

1028
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,640
Then, help me break this door open, Dr. Agasa!

1029
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
What?

1030
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,140
Quick.

1031
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,840
Here goes!

1032
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,340
One more time!

1033
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,440
-Wait. -One, two, go.

1034
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,440
One, two, go...

1035
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,950
An accident you say?

1036
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,150
Yes, we can't be 100 percent sure yet,

1037
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,450
but it is very likely to be an accident.

1038
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:01,950
Officer Yokomizo.

1039
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,050
The cause of death seems to have been this object.

1040
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,550
It may have hit him when he fell.

1041
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,650
Just as I thought.

1042
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,850
He fell?

1043
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,550
In other words,

1044
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,750
Mr. Masami Hirota wanted to take something that was on the bookshelf,

1045
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,050
and placed his foot on the shelf.

1046
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,250
He lost his balance and fell, bookshelf and all.

1047
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,250
Then, he bumped the back of his head onto that object

1048
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,150
that had already fallen to the floor,

1049
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,950
and it killed him.

1050
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,350
As proof of that, the door of this room,

1051
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,550
and the windows located above the door were all locked securely.

1052
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:41,950
Besides, the only key there is to this room,

1053
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:45,850
was scattered over the floor with the books, under the notebook.

1054
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,950
Professor Hirota, locked the door himself,

1055
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:53,950
and died because of the accident, right after that?

1056
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,850
Yes, no matter how you look at it...

1057
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,350
He could've been killed by someone.

1058
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,650
It was just made to look like an accident.

1059
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:04,650
You're the boy that's staying with Mr. Mouri, right?

1060
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,250
Oh, yes. That's right.

1061
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,150
He's the son of a relative of mine.

1062
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,950
See, look at this phone, it's toppled on the floor, right?

1063
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:21,750
That's because the phone book fell together with the bookshelf.

1064
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:26,250
Then, why is the receiver not off the hook?

1065
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,850
Although the phone is upside down

1066
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:30,750
and is camouflaged with the book on top of it,

1067
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,650
someone has deliberately messed this room up.

1068
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,350
Then, is this homicide?

1069
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:41,350
Wait. If so, this would be...

1070
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:45,150
a murder behind locked doors.

1071
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,350
Murder behind...

1072
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,650
Locked doors?

1073
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,750
Right, the doors were all locked,

1074
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,050
and the key to this room was found here.

1075
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:58,850
Then who... who killed my husband?

1076
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,150
Please calm down, Mrs. Hirota.

1077
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:05,750
Were there any suspicious people who came to see him tonight?

1078
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,950
He seems to have had 3 or 4 guests including Mr. Agasa.

1079
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,350
Me?

1080
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,050
An acquaintance of mine

1081
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,650
told me that she had mistakenly given Professor Hirota her floppy,

1082
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,350
I came to get it back.

1083
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,850
So, I'm sure that it is besides that computer.

1084
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:27,850
All the floppies are gone. A whole bunch of them.

1085
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:28,850
What?

1086
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:32,550
At this rate, maybe all the data in this computer is also erased.

1087
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,650
What's with that girl?

1088
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,550
She's also the child of my relative.

1089
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:40,650
Hey, Ai, don't touch!

1090
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,850
At any rate, I have nothing to do with this murder.

1091
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,250
No one would be stupid enough to bring children along

1092
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,250
when thinking of committing murder, right?

1093
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,450
That's true.

1094
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:54,150
Listen, little lady, I don't want you touching anything in this room.

1095
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:57,150
Go to the room next door and wait there quietly with your grandpa.

1096
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,450
Understand?

1097
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:03,650
I'm still 52, too young to be called grandpa, don't you think?

1098
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,550
Hey, don't tell me they took the floppies?

1099
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,550
Very likely.

1100
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:15,350
Because the lost record of the data of the poison,

1101
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,650
as well as the record of the parcel

1102
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,650
that I sent back to my sister about the same time,

1103
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,550
are all left behind at the organization.

1104
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,750
I see.

1105
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,650
So, they could've predicted that since you fled from the organization,

1106
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,750
you would stop by here to come get the data.

1107
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:34,150
The organization came here to look for the data and suck in here,

1108
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,250
but was seen by Professor Hirota, so they killed him.

1109
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,650
Not good.

1110
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:41,450
No, let's not jump to conclusions too fast.

1111
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:45,450
First, let's ask about the people who came here tonight.

1112
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:47,150
We'll think about everything else later.

1113
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:52,250
You were at a community meeting?

1114
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,250
Yes, together with a neighbor of mine,

1115
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,150
from 20:00 to 23:00, for three hours.

1116
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,150
Which means that you haven't met the guests

1117
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,750
who have come to see your husband tonight?

1118
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:05,350
No, all except the first person who came,

1119
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,750
who came just when I was ready to leave?

1120
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,150
My husband said it was one of his students.

1121
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:13,350
I think he said the person's name was Hosoya.

1122
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,550
Okay! Bring that person called Hosoya

1123
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:19,150
who is a student of Professor Hirota, and was here tonight!

1124
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,550
Yes, sir!

1125
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,650
Do you know the names of the other people who came here?

1126
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:25,850
I wonder.

1127
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,750
I have no idea, except for Dr. Agasa who called

1128
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,150
just before I was ready to leave.

1129
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:35,450
Although, my husband did say 2-3 of his students were coming.

1130
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,650
Which means that we have no choice

1131
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,950
but to check on all of his students who were here.

1132
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,350
Hey, blinking on this phone here.

1133
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,250
This is an answer phone, isn't it?

1134
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,450
We could find something out if we listen to this, right?

1135
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:53,450
Yes.

1136
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,650
You have thirteen messages.

1137
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,950
Thirteen? There sure are a lot of before the phone messages.

1138
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,350
Hello, this is Shirokura...

1139
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:08,350
Professor Hirota, the promise was for tonight?

1140
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:10,350
Who is this Mr. Shirokura?

1141
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:14,350
I've met Mr. Shirokura before. He's still a young man.

1142
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:18,550
Strange, why is the tape cut off here and there?

1143
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:25,050
This is Morioka. What time am I supposed to go there tonight?

1144
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,250
Who is he?

1145
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,250
I know Mr. Morioka, too.

1146
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,750
He is my husband's first student

1147
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,550
and comes over a lot.

1148
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,050
Do you have the address and phone number

1149
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,850
of Mr. Shirokura and Mr. Morioka?

1150
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:41,550
-Yes. -I'm Shirokura.

1151
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:44,050
What's the matter? What's all this commotion about?

1152
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:46,150
Did something happen here?

1153
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:50,150
Professor Hirota has been murdered by someone.

1154
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,650
What?

1155
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,550
Hello, this is Shirokura...

1156
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,550
I've got other matters to attend to tomorrow,

1157
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,550
so I'll head on over there now.

1158
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,850
You placed 10 messages in here and Mr. Morioka placed two messages.

1159
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:09,450
Mr. Shirokura, you sure left a lot of messages, didn't you?

1160
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:13,250
Like I'm telling you. I came here directly

1161
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,950
because he wouldn't answer, no matter how many times I called.

1162
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,050
All right.

1163
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:21,850
But, why did something like this happen to him?

1164
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:25,350
This is the 13th, and the last message.

1165
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,050
This is black... life.

1166
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:31,450
I'd like to come over to explain our new insurance plan.

1167
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,550
What time should I over?

1168
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,350
I will call again later.

1169
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,850
An insurance agent?

1170
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:44,150
No! Although the voice is a bit changed using a machine,

1171
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,550
his way of talking is...

1172
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,050
This voice is...

1173
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,050
Vodka.

1174
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,650
Now.

1175
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,650
Hey, then this case involves those guys, after all?

1176
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,550
No, the possibility of them having done anything have decreased.

1177
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,150
If they had come here to get the floppy,

1178
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,750
they wouldn't have done something as stupid

1179
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,350
as to leave their voices on tape at the scene of a crime.

1180
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:16,950
True, it would be a cinch for them to pick up the floppy

1181
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:19,550
without even creating such a locked-in-room situation.

1182
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,450
They left the message on the answer phone,

1183
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:24,350
so that in case Professor Hirota was home,

1184
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,250
it would ease his suspicion of them,

1185
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,650
and make it easier for them to carry out their purpose.

1186
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:33,550
I'll bet they're all panicky now

1187
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,550
because they can't come to get the floppy.

1188
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,850
Then, if so, then they'll be here soon.

1189
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:43,550
Yeah. We were right to move your Volkswagen elsewhere.

1190
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:47,750
They may be somewhere near here already.

1191
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,970
What? Professor Hirota was killed?

1192
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,670
That's ridiculous.

1193
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,470
He was fine till just a while ago.

1194
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:08,870
Mr. Hosoya, you came here just as Mrs. Hirota was going out, didn't you?

1195
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,270
Yes.

1196
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:13,670
My daughter is going to apply for Nanyo University,

1197
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:17,670
so I came to have Professor Hirota write out a recommendation for her.

1198
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:23,070
But the professor was so drunk, that I decided to leave for today.

1199
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,770
Is it true that the was drinking?

1200
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,070
Yes, from the evening.

1201
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:33,570
Mr. Morioka, according to the message in the answer phone,

1202
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,870
you were also supposed to meet Professor Hirota.

1203
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,070
Yes.

1204
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,570
To play chess. Professor Hirota and I play chess together.

1205
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:45,070
He asked me to come over and play tonight, too.

1206
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:49,070
See, chess pieces are scattered all over the floor.

1207
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,670
We used to always play in this room.

1208
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:55,470
I phoned twice because we didn't decide what time to start,

1209
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,670
but the answer phone was set.

1210
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,170
I came to check out what was happening because

1211
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,770
he wouldn't answer the phone despite having called me from his side.

1212
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,370
You came here tonight?

1213
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:07,470
Yes, I came around 9:30 pm.

1214
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,170
Although the front door was open, nobody answered the doorbell.

1215
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,370
So, I thought he had forgotten about the game and went to sleep.

1216
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:15,270
I went into the house.

1217
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:18,270
But, when I knocked on the door of the study, nobody answered,

1218
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,770
and on top of that, the door was locked.

1219
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,270
So, I gave up and left.

1220
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:25,970
I see. And Mr. Agasa arrived an hour later,

1221
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,570
realized that something was wrong, broke the door open

1222
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,570
and found the corpse?

1223
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,870
Yes, that's right.

1224
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:37,270
By the way, Mr. Shirokura, you came right after we got here, right?

1225
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:41,370
I haven't asked you what you came here for yet tonight.

1226
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,470
Yes, the fact is, I am working as a model.

1227
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:46,170
I'm supposed be doing a column in a magazine entitled,

1228
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,970
"The Unexpected Plain Face of a Model".

1229
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,870
I took a picture of me dressed in woman's clothes

1230
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:55,370
during a university festival, together with Professor Hirota,

1231
01:10:55,370 --> 01:11:01,170
and I came to get the floppy with the data of the picture from him.

1232
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,370
He saved the data of the picture in a floppy?

1233
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:07,470
Yes, my husband used to input all the pictures that he liked

1234
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,470
into the computer.

1235
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:11,470
He not only saved pictures.

1236
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,370
He also saved the entrance exams of universities,

1237
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,370
the grades of his students,

1238
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,370
and even saved the process and results of the chess games

1239
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,170
that he played with Mr. Morioka.

1240
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,470
I see.

1241
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:24,070
So, the killer stole all of those floppies

1242
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:27,270
after killing Professor Hirota.

1243
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,270
Which means that the criminal killed to get a hold of them.

1244
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:34,370
Your daughter's going to be applying for Nanyo University, isn't she?

1245
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:36,070
Yes.

1246
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,870
If you got a hold of the floppies it with the entrance exams in them,

1247
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,370
she would definitely get in, wouldn't she?

1248
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:46,170
No, it never even crossed my mind.

1249
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:50,170
Somebody else would've been here besides us, right?

1250
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:55,270
Moreover, the professor was also using the computer at the university.

1251
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:00,070
The professor himself could've taken all the floppies to the university.

1252
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:01,370
It's possible.

1253
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,870
He never writes anything on the label,

1254
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,770
so he may've taken all the floppies to write the labels.

1255
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,970
Besides, this room was locked from the inside, wasn't it?

1256
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,070
Moreover, wasn't the key to this room

1257
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:14,070
found here under the notebook that was on the floor?

1258
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,370
Officer, no matter how you look at it...

1259
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,570
Exactly.

1260
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,870
All the possible places of entry were locked

1261
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:26,170
and the only possible space

1262
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,770
if any was between the door and the floor,

1263
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:30,770
which only a key would slide through.

1264
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:34,970
If a rubber band or a fishing string were used,

1265
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,070
it may've been possible to kill Professor Hirota,

1266
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:37,970
take the fishing string away,

1267
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:40,870
lock the door from the outside and from the space beneath the door,

1268
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,970
move the key to the center of the room.

1269
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:47,270
It would be close to impossible to slide the key nicely

1270
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,970
under the notebook.

1271
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,370
What bothers me is

1272
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,970
why despite all the books that were scattered around the room,

1273
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,970
was there only the notebook in question on the floor

1274
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,970
which was lined in a row from the door to the phone?

1275
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:04,270
The tape of the answering phone is a bit out of shape

1276
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:06,370
but this couldn't have possibly been used

1277
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,170
to push the key under the notebook.

1278
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,070
Conan Edogawa?

1279
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:15,270
Remember, the boy in glasses I told you about last time.

1280
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:20,970
You also said that you went to somebody's house at Beika Town?

1281
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,170
You mean Shinichi Kudo?

1282
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:27,770
Right, he's the boy of the Detective Office there.

1283
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,970
He seems a bit different.

1284
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:34,270
He's unusual cool-headed and very adultish for a child.

1285
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:36,770
How about you, Akemi? Are you all right?

1286
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,670
I heard that you were in hot water or something.

1287
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:42,670
Don't worry, I'm doing fine.

1288
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:45,670
I'm more worried about you, Shiho.

1289
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:48,070
Cut out making poison

1290
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:51,470
and go find yourself a lover or two.

1291
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,870
I'm really okay.

1292
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,570
I'm really okay.

1293
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,470
I'm really okay.

1294
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:18,470
Impossible to lock the door from the outside,

1295
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:19,670
and slide the key to the center of the room,

1296
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,270
much less to slide it under the notebook.

1297
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,170
It would be impossible

1298
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:28,370
even if the tape of the answer phone were to be used.

1299
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,570
Although there are many queer points,

1300
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:33,170
if the late Professor Hirota were wasted,

1301
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:37,670
it's not all that strange if he fell together with the bookshelf,

1302
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:40,470
and hit the back of his head.

1303
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:43,070
Besides, it's too dangerous to stay here any longer,

1304
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,670
as well as useless.

1305
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:48,670
Forget it, Shinichi. Forget this case.

1306
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:52,470
It's checkmate.

1307
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,270
Checkmate?

1308
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,970
Hurry, let's get out of here from the back door.

1309
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,770
Hold it.

1310
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,070
Don't you care to know the truth of this case?

1311
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:15,370
Like I said. No matter how you look at it...

1312
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,970
This is no accident. It's homicide!

1313
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,070
After the killer murdered Professor Hirota,

1314
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,570
he used a trick and locked this room up from the inside

1315
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,870
to make it look like an accident.

1316
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:28,370
I'll show you what the truth is, starting right this minute.

1317
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:33,270
I'll show you that there is no case that can't be solved in this world.

1318
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:42,230
It's an accident, an accident.

1319
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,630
Professor Hirota was drunk, fell down together with the bookshelf,

1320
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,030
hit the back of his head violently and died.

1321
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:50,030
Judging from the circumstances at the scene,

1322
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,830
it sure can be looked at in that way,

1323
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:54,130
but there are several points that bother me.

1324
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,030
I don't care about that.

1325
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,130
The room was locked,

1326
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:01,230
and moreover, the key was under the notebook among scattered books, right?

1327
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:05,130
If there were a killer, how did that person lock the door?

1328
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:07,730
That's why we're trying to figure that out.

1329
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,430
I'm sorry, but I have some matters to attend to tomorrow,

1330
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,830
-so if you will excuse me. -I'll be on my way, too.

1331
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,530
I'm leaving, too.

1332
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:16,630
Hey, wait.

1333
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,830
Everybody, wait up.

1334
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,130
I just...

1335
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:24,530
Hey, what are you using my voice suddenly for?

1336
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:27,230
I've figured it out.

1337
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:29,930
How the trick of the locked door murder was carried out,

1338
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:33,830
as well as who the killer is.

1339
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,830
What?

1340
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,230
Hey, Shinichi.

1341
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,330
Never mind just move your mouth in keeping with my voice.

1342
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,530
Seriously. Like I've been telling you,

1343
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,030
no matter how you look at it.

1344
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:50,130
No, no, that's why amateurs are no good.

1345
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,230
An amateur.

1346
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:52,530
And just who do you think you are?

1347
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:54,730
The room was indeed locked from the inside.

1348
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,930
No matter how you look at it, it looks to be an accident.

1349
01:16:56,930 --> 01:17:00,430
But, this trick of a locked room can be carried out perfectly

1350
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:04,230
by using the cassette tape of the answer phone and the chess piece.

1351
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,930
Cassette tape?

1352
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,630
A chess piece?

1353
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,330
Are you sure, Shinichi?

1354
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,630
Hey, stop glancing at me.

1355
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,030
Act more confident like a detective, will you?

1356
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:20,830
Proof speaks more than words. Show us, will you?

1357
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:25,230
The trick that you have imagined, right here, before us all.

1358
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,330
Definitely.

1359
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:31,730
I'll have Conan help me and replay how it was done.

1360
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,230
Do you know what you're doing?

1361
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:37,930
Yes, trust me. It'll work 100 percent.

1362
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,930
Officer, do you happen to have a cellular on you?

1363
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,830
Yes, I have one.

1364
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,930
Lend me that glove, too.

1365
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,030
Officer Yokomizo, I've brought the cassette tape.

1366
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,030
It is the same as the one used in the telephone here.

1367
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,330
Why? I asked for no such thing.

1368
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,330
What? But just a while ago, this boy said...

1369
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,330
Well, never mind, it's no big thing!

1370
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,330
May I have the tape, officer?

1371
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:12,030
First, pull out the tape to a certain length.

1372
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,230
Hey.

1373
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,430
Set the cassette into the phone.

1374
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:18,030
Of course, the tape is left sticking out.

1375
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:21,830
Next, straighten the tape that is sticking out, and pull it straight.

1376
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,230
Go out of the door,

1377
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:28,030
and pull the tape through the ring of the key.

1378
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:31,330
Then leave that key outside the door, take the remaining tape

1379
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:35,730
and go back to the place where the notebook was on the floor.

1380
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,030
Next, place three pawns

1381
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:41,530
that are of the same height in the shape of a triangle,

1382
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:43,230
then hook the edge of the tape that is left,

1383
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:46,330
onto the pawn that is closest to the phone,

1384
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,430
and place the notebook on it.

1385
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,630
What a joke.

1386
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,330
You may be trying to knock the pawn over

1387
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:55,130
with the force of the tape being pulled,

1388
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,330
but that's just a paper plan.

1389
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:59,230
The stand of the pawn is quite stable,

1390
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,130
so the key will hook on to the pawn before it falls,

1391
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,130
and come out from under the notebook.

1392
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,230
It's the opposite.

1393
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,730
I'm going to turn the pawn upside down after this.

1394
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:13,130
Even if the head of the pawn is round,

1395
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,230
so long as the cover of the notebook is firm like this,

1396
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:17,730
it can be placed on.

1397
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:23,730
You just wait and see. I'll do it for you right now.

1398
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,730
First, the door is locked from the outside.

1399
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,130
Then, the key is placed on the floor and a phone call is made.

1400
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:43,330
The answer phone goes off, and the tape is wound.

1401
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:47,430
The key is pulled in under the space of the door,

1402
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:50,830
and moves under the notebook that is placed in the center of the room.

1403
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,730
It will eventually bump into the pawn,

1404
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:56,430
which will then lose its balance and the key...

1405
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,530
will go under the notebook.

1406
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,630
It went in.

1407
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,930
I see.

1408
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,430
So, if you keep on moving the answer phone,

1409
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:09,930
the tape is wound, and the evidence vanishes.

1410
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,630
Well? Did it work?

1411
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:14,830
It was fantastic, Shinichi.

1412
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:19,330
Oh, no. Well, it's just as I thought.

1413
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:22,730
And if the pawn is place at a corner of the notebook,

1414
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,730
it would make it more difficult from the pawn to roll under the notebook.

1415
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:28,930
Well, even if it did, it wouldn't look very unnatural.

1416
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:31,430
Which means that the one who called

1417
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,330
and left 10 messages in the answer phone

1418
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:35,130
in order to use the trick

1419
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,830
is you, Mr. Akira Shirakura.

1420
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:41,730
Then, are you the one who killed my husband?

1421
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:43,530
Wait.

1422
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,030
The tape was twisted here and there,

1423
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:48,730
and that serves as evidence that the tape was used for the trick!

1424
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:50,230
Is that right?

1425
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,430
Just a minute, please.

1426
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:55,530
I admit that the trick just now is really superb.

1427
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:59,030
But, why do I turn out to be the one who set it up?

1428
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:03,030
All I did was put a lot of messages in the answering machine.

1429
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,930
In the first place, if I were the one who did it,

1430
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,630
I wouldn't come all the way back here.

1431
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,630
You came back to get something, didn't you?

1432
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,530
Yes, you came to get the tape of the answer phone

1433
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,830
because it had your fingerprints all over the place.

1434
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:19,130
When I took a look at the tape a while ago,

1435
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:21,130
I could tell in one glance.

1436
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:24,330
There were the fingerprints of somebody all over the tape.

1437
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:29,630
And I could also tell that this was an unprepared, impulsive murder.

1438
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:34,730
You probably met Professor Hirota tonight and got into an argument.

1439
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:37,830
You then, impulsively hit him on the head.

1440
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:41,730
Fortunately, this trick crossed your mind,

1441
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,130
and you were able to think up a locked door murder

1442
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:45,430
which looked to be an accident.

1443
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:47,930
But, since the murder wasn't planned ahead,

1444
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:49,030
you didn't have gloves,

1445
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:52,130
And you couldn't help getting your fingerprints on the tape.

1446
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:55,330
Therefore, you decided to be the first to discover the corpse,

1447
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:59,330
and after you made Mrs. Hirota confirm that the door was locked,

1448
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:02,930
you were waiting for a time when you could switch tapes.

1449
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:05,330
However, we found the corpse first,

1450
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,830
and the police arrived sooner than expected,

1451
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:11,330
so having no choice, you came here like you said in the tape.

1452
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:15,730
You went out of the way to leave your name on the tape,

1453
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,130
so that in case you couldn't grit the tape, back,

1454
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:22,130
it would make it more difficult to see through the trick.

1455
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:24,630
If there are many no-message recordings,

1456
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,830
whether you like it or not,

1457
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,530
attention would focus on the tape with your fingerprints on.

1458
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:32,930
You can go ahead and check Mr. Shirakura if you like.

1459
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:35,930
He's bound to have Professor Hirota's floppies on him somewhere.

1460
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,530
After all, he couldn't have possibly checked the contents

1461
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:43,230
of the large batch of floppies he took in such a short time.

1462
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:47,330
Then, can we start by searching your house, Mr. Shirakura?

1463
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:51,030
They're in the dashboard of my car

1464
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:53,230
that is parked in front of this house.

1465
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:56,130
All the floppies are there.

1466
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,330
The one with the data of the pictures is there, too.

1467
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:01,030
Pictures?

1468
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:03,130
Didn't I tell you a while ago?

1469
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:06,530
That I'm supposed be doing a column in a magazine

1470
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,430
entitled, "The Unexpected Plain Face of a Model",

1471
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,830
and that I took a picture of me dressed in woman's clothes

1472
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:14,530
during a university festival, together with Professor Hirota.

1473
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:17,530
But what he had sent me was a message that said,

1474
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:22,830
"There is Nothing Better Than This Plain Face of Yours".

1475
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,930
And a picture of my face in the past.

1476
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:26,330
Your face in the past?

1477
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:30,330
I had plastic surgery when I became a model.

1478
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:31,730
I changed my name, too.

1479
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:34,530
I thought it was just the picture.

1480
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,030
My face wasn't all that clear because of the make-up and wig,

1481
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,030
and with it being me dressed in woman's clothes,

1482
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:39,430
I thought it would be a good joke.

1483
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:42,530
I naturally couldn't give the editor a picture of the face of the past.

1484
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:47,430
So, I came to ask the professor to lend me the picture.

1485
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,230
But, he...

1486
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:53,030
Oh, I forgot which floppy it was

1487
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,530
that had the picture of you dressed in woman's clothes.

1488
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,630
If it's the picture I sent to you, I can get it out right away.

1489
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:04,030
I can send it directly to the editor's office if you like?

1490
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:07,730
I got enraged at his words.

1491
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:10,730
And when I snapped back to myself.

1492
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,130
Professor Hirota was on the floor before me.

1493
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:20,530
The rest is as he had explained.

1494
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:23,230
Everything is right to the smallest detail.

1495
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,930
Okay, please come to the station with us, then.

1496
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:27,930
Hey.

1497
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,430
Yes, sir.

1498
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:37,430
Mr. Shirakura.

1499
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:39,530
Maybe it's none of my business.

1500
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:42,230
But I think that Professor Hirota sent you the picture of your past,

1501
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:46,430
because he wanted you to have more confidence in yourself

1502
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:48,730
as well as be true to yourself.

1503
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:54,930
I would've liked to hear those words directly from Professor Hirota.

1504
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:58,430
Too bad.

1505
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,330
Well, that was a fantastic deduction.

1506
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:08,930
Thanks to you, the case was solved, Mr. Agasa.

1507
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:10,830
Well, no.

1508
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:15,530
And I would like to have the floppy that I came to get, back right away.

1509
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:20,530
No. We'll have to check out the evidence at the station first.

1510
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:23,030
So, he says. What now?

1511
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:27,130
Can't help it. I guess we'll get out of here for now.

1512
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:29,530
Okay, then. We'll be heading home.

1513
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,430
Take care.

1514
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,830
Hey, come on, you too.

1515
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,830
Why?

1516
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:43,030
Why didn't you save my sister?

1517
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:47,030
Your sister?

1518
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,830
You still haven't realized?

1519
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:51,930
Masami Hirota is an alias that my sister

1520
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,630
took from Professor Hirota's name.

1521
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:56,530
Don't tell me that the Masami Hirota of the 10 billion bank robbery

1522
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,030
is your...

1523
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,430
You can't go...

1524
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,030
Ms. Masami Hirota.

1525
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:15,730
You'll be killed if you go.

1526
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,830
Thank you.

1527
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:20,930
I'm sorry, Conan.

1528
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:26,130
Who is behind the black curtain?

1529
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,030
Where are you?

1530
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:33,330
Show yourself!

1531
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:34,830
Well done.

1532
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,830
Masami Hirota.

1533
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:41,630
Or should I said, Akemi Miyano.

1534
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,430
Gunshot.

1535
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:46,830
Ms. Masami.

1536
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,330
Hold on there!

1537
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,130
Ms. Masami.

1538
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:55,730
It's a large organization consumed by mysteries.

1539
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:57,930
The only thing I know about the organization

1540
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:00,730
is that it's color is black.

1541
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:02,030
Black?

1542
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,430
That's right.

1543
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:06,230
The way the individuals of the organization can identify one another

1544
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:08,930
is their black crow-like trench coat.

1545
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,830
Take this.

1546
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:17,830
Please, before they realize it.

1547
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:21,530
I'll leave it to you, little detective.

1548
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:26,330
So, she was your older sister.

1549
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:27,830
That's right!

1550
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,130
Hey.

1551
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:32,730
With your power of deduction,

1552
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:36,230
you could've easily seen through what my sister was up to!

1553
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,330
Then why... why didn't you?

1554
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:41,330
Why?

1555
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:46,230
Her trembling, crying voice,

1556
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:49,730
brought back memories of a painful and sad case

1557
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:51,830
that I had almost forgotten.

1558
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:58,630
The was probably the first time she showed her real self to me.

1559
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:31,130
A week later, the floppy was sent to us from the police,

1560
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:35,430
so we decided to take a look at it on the computer right away.

1561
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:39,030
It's a wonder it made it through the investigation of the police.

1562
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,130
All the floppies of the organization

1563
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:44,830
are plain text files unless a password is entered.

1564
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:46,530
They would never be suspected.

1565
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:49,630
How is it? Will it come out?

1566
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:52,930
Yes. And the data that is in here is not only of the poison.

1567
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:56,230
The real name, address and code name of the person

1568
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:59,130
who was working on the poison

1569
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,830
before I was placed in my position is supposed to be in here, too.

1570
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:03,330
The name of the person who invested in this research

1571
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:05,730
should also be in here.

1572
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,230
I see.

1573
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:11,430
If we do it right, we make be able to strip them naked.

1574
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:18,730
Gin, seems like the old man called Hirota dropped dead.

1575
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:23,130
Yes, it saved us the trouble of killing him ourselves.

1576
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,330
But, we still don't know the whereabouts

1577
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,230
of the woman who got away.

1578
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,730
They're checking to see

1579
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:34,130
if somebody within the organization helped her escape.

1580
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:37,030
And now, the places they may drop into

1581
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:39,130
have all been gotten rid of.

1582
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:42,430
I'm sure she'll come out from her side soon...

1583
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:45,130
I heard that the floppy with information on the poison

1584
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,330
was forfeited by the police.

1585
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:50,330
That's nothing to worry about.

1586
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:53,930
That floppy is a bit rigged.

1587
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:59,130
What's happening?

1588
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,330
What is this?

1589
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:05,830
Computer virus, Night Baron.

1590
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,230
What?

1591
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,730
The floppy has been programmed so that if it is booted up with a computer

1592
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:14,230
other than the organization's, a virus eats the data.

1593
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:15,630
How careless of me.

1594
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,530
Then, all the data is...

1595
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:20,930
Yes. Everything has vanished.

1596
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,930
Even the computer program.

1597
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:24,230
What?

1598
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,830
Darn.

1599
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:35,230
It seems that we're going to be hanging around each other for a long time,

1600
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:36,630
Conan Edogawa.
