1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,340
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,240
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,940
Today, those guys finally appear.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,040
I'm going to expose their black conspiracy.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,790
Let's hurry home and play more soccer!

10
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,090
Yeah, let's do that!

11
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,190
I'm the captain!

12
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,090
What? You again?

13
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,490
Hey, did you see yesterday's game!

14
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,790
It was really something, wasn't it?

15
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,990
Yeah, you mean Hide's over head kick, right?

16
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,290
The game's over.

17
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,790
That was indeed a work of art!

18
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,690
Hide is the best!

19
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,790
It's time to wake up from your dream.

20
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,990
Let's celebrate our re-encounter

21
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,390
with a rose, the flower that you like,

22
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,890
with color as red as that of blood.

23
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,490
Okay, Sherry?

24
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,890
What a terrible dream.

25
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,190
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Haibara Part)"

26
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,090
Haibara!

27
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,290
Here's the MO I borrowed!

28
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,890
Please tell Dr. Agasa that

29
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,890
the game was way more than we expected!

30
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,990
Sure. I'll tell him.

31
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,490
I didn't really care for the boss character, though!

32
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,290
But, it was way better than the previous game!

33
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,090
Look!

34
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,790
See! It's snowing!

35
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,990
-What? -No joke?

36
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,290
Snow?

37
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,690
Let's celebrate our re-encounter

38
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,890
with a rose, the flower that you like,

39
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,990
with color as red as that of blood.

40
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,490
Okay, Sherry?

41
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,590
See, why don't you look at the snow from the window too, Haibara!

42
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,290
Don't touch me!

43
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,990
-What? -Haibara?

44
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,790
Is something wrong?

45
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,890
I'm sick and tired of this place.

46
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,990
If I could, I want to disappear from here, right this minute.

47
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,290
It'll turn out that way in time anyway, I guess.

48
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,490
What?

49
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,490
Are you changing schools, Haibara?

50
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,890
What?

51
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,490
Don't tell me that someone is bullying you?

52
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,590
I'll get the guy, so tell me who!

53
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,690
So, don't say that you're going to go away!

54
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,590
I'm only joking.

55
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,790
Don't take me seriously.

56
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,890
What?

57
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,290
I was just kind of annoyed

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,990
because I have a cold.

59
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,890
I didn't want to give it to you,

60
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,590
Oh, it's just a cold.

61
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,990
They say people get fussy when they get sick.

62
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,990
Come along...

63
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,690
If you've got a cold, you got to go to the infirmary.

64
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,990
Take that!

65
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,490
What was that?

66
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,690
Here you go!

67
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,290
I did it!

68
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,190
What a face.

69
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,290
You're going to get it, Mitsuhiko!

70
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,190
Wait!

71
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,090
This is not where I belong.

72
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,690
What?

73
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,190
I've got to get out of here fast,

74
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,890
so that I don't get those kids involved.

75
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,590
I bet you're thinking of something stupid like that?

76
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,590
Don't worry.

77
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,490
It is a dream story for a body to shrink with medicine.

78
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,690
Nobody would believe it nor even think of it happening!

79
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,890
We got to keep on acting like children

80
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,290
so that this won't be disclosed.

81
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,290
Until the time is right.

82
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,890
Don't worry!

83
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,490
If things start looking bad, I'll do something about it for you!

84
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,190
Bye!

85
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,290
See you tomorrow!

86
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,490
Bye-bye!

87
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,790
Bye!

88
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,690
Kudo.

89
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,890
You don't know a thing.

90
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,090
They're not people that you can take on alone.

91
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,090
If we ever get off our guard, that's it.

92
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,890
They won't let us be.

93
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,690
Yes. If it is like in my dream,

94
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,690
they are looking for us

95
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,290
somewhere in this town.

96
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,890
What is it?

97
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,090
Is something wrong with that black Porsche?

98
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,890
Porsche 356A.

99
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,590
It's a classic car from 50 years ago.

100
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,190
The owner seems to be away.

101
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,390
I've only seen it on TV and in books,

102
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,390
but I guess there are people

103
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,190
who are really riding these cars around.

104
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,690
Gin.

105
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,790
What?

106
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,990
Gin owns this car too.

107
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,890
Gin too?

108
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,490
Yes. This car came out in my dream.

109
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,890
Hey, just what are you?

110
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,590
Oh, Dr. Agasa?

111
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,090
Will you bring the following things

112
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,190
to the intersection of Yonchome?

113
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,790
I'll explain later! Hurry!

114
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,690
Hey.

115
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,790
Did you bring the stuff?

116
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,390
Yeah.

117
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,690
A wire hanger and a wrench.

118
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,490
What are you going to do with these things?

119
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,690
Hey.

120
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,390
Old cars can be opened like this.

121
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,390
Kudo?

122
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,090
Just what are you going to do?

123
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,490
I'm going to set up a wiretap and transmitter in the car.

124
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,790
But you don't even know if this car is his.

125
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,790
What's the matter?

126
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,690
On the other side of the street.

127
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,690
On the other side of the street?

128
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,490
Gin. Vodka!

129
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,490
You idiot!

130
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,390
The ground around the car sure is messed up.

131
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,990
Maybe the passersby were looking at your car,

132
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,490
because it's rare?

133
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,990
"Germany's Rainfrog"

134
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,890
It sure became famous.

135
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,590
Bull's eye.

136
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,990
What a place to run into them.

137
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,090
I'm delighted. Gin!

138
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,490
I'm not letting them get away this time!

139
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,690
Go straight.

140
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,690
I want you to go after them without getting too close.

141
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,690
No.

142
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,190
You won't be able to do a thing

143
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,190
even if you figure out where he is.

144
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,190
With our bodies like this.

145
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,290
Do you have any idea

146
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,390
what dangerous situation are you in now?

147
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,790
Shut up! Be quiet!

148
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,790
Telephone?

149
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,490
Yeah, it's me.

150
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,490
How's it going?

151
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,490
What? He hasn't come yet?

152
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,390
No big deal.

153
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,990
The target will come to Haido City Hotel at 18:00 sharp.

154
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,390
Not even aware that it is going to be his farewell party.

155
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,690
Target? Farewell party?

156
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,790
Anyway, we've got to shut him up before he is arrested.

157
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,290
We can use that poison if needed.

158
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,690
The poison?

159
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,790
Don't goof, Pisco.

160
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,490
Pisco?

161
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,590
I've heard that code name before though.

162
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,390
I've never seen the person.

163
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,990
Pisco. Haido City Hotel.

164
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,790
A reddish brown hair?

165
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,690
Gin? What's up?

166
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,490
What is that?

167
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,090
It's probably a transmitter and a wiretap.

168
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,390
Oh, no! He's found it!

169
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,290
What?

170
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,290
I didn't think you'd appear from your side.

171
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,190
I'm honored and welcome you, Sherry.

172
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,670
What're you going to do?

173
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,170
Things look really bad.

174
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,170
Your transmitter and wiretap have been crushed,

175
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,870
so we can't pursue them.

176
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,570
Moreover, the chewing gum that you used to place them

177
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,870
into their car is in their hands...

178
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,370
If they ever check on that...

179
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,170
Don't worry!

180
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,670
I got rid of my teeth marks too,

181
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,270
and the most they can figure out from my saliva is my blood type.

182
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,770
I wiped off all the fingerprints in the car too.

183
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,570
Then, we should turn a corner

184
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,970
and pull away from them right away.

185
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,270
It's dangerous to just vaguely follow

186
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,470
the traces of their car like this.

187
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,970
Yeah. I'll stop pursuing them.

188
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,870
But that doesn't mean I'm going to run from them.

189
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,270
What?

190
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,170
The Haido City Hotel.

191
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,970
They're planning to make a guy named Pisco

192
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,170
to assassinate somebody there.

193
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,870
We got to go to that hotel

194
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,070
to at least prevent the assassination.

195
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,370
My, how righteous.

196
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,370
Not for me.

197
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,170
Besides, I'm not interested in something abstract

198
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,770
like righteousness.

199
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,270
I don't think we can do much anyway,

200
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,970
going to such a dangerous place.

201
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,270
Yeah. I don't intend to take you along either.

202
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,470
It'll be too dangerous to take you along,

203
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,570
since they know what you looked like as a child.

204
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,670
Well, you just wait in the car with Dr. Agasa!

205
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,170
If worse comes to worse, I'll at least try

206
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,370
and get back the poison!

207
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,870
The poison?

208
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,770
Gin was saying this on the phone,

209
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,870
"We can use the poison if needed."

210
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,870
It's probably the APTX4869.

211
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,170
The one that shrunk our bodies.

212
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,770
The poison in question.

213
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,370
Yeah, right, Sherry.

214
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,770
The chick who betrayed the organization.

215
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,370
She should be headed that way soon.

216
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,370
If you don't know what she looks like,

217
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,170
look her up on the organization's database.

218
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,470
After I check on whether she left

219
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,770
anything more than the wiretap and transmitter that I found,

220
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,570
I'll join you.

221
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,470
Yeah. I'm sure.

222
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,370
She'll come

223
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,670
because I mentioned about the poison.

224
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,170
Whether you want to take advantage

225
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,570
of the dopey detective or not,

226
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,070
it's up to you

227
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,270
Anyway, as soon as you find the chick,

228
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,370
show me what she looks like.

229
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,370
Yeah. No problem.

230
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,770
If she's gone from neck down.

231
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,970
Gosh.

232
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,670
I thought you weren't interested?

233
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,970
I had no choice

234
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,470
because I'm the one who made the poison.

235
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,070
I don't want you calling me a killer anymore.

236
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,470
Be careful.

237
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,370
It's easy for them to tell

238
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,170
the one who set the transmitter will show up here too.

239
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,470
If they find out that you're involved...

240
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,870
I'll be fine.

241
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,670
You got rid of the evidence, didn't you?

242
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,970
They'll take it as being a simple prank

243
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,470
or something done by someone

244
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,170
who has a grudge against the organization.

245
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,370
Are you sure it's this hall?

246
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,370
Yeah.

247
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,270
"Farewell Party" -Gin said that it's a farewell party.

248
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,170
The guy called Pisco and his target

249
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,870
are also supposed to come here.

250
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,770
That's enough talking already.

251
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,870
Here we go.

252
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,270
Darn it. I know it's a farewell party,

253
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,470
but get a load of all the people in black.

254
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,170
Each and everyone of them looks suspicious.

255
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,270
Sherry.

256
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,370
Sherry.

257
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,270
Sherry.

258
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,070
Sherry.

259
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,570
What's the matter little girl?

260
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,670
Are you separated from your parents?

261
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,770
Yes! We're looking for them together.

262
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,270
Let's go, Hana!

263
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,670
Hey, what is wrong with you?

264
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,470
It's not like you.

265
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,270
You're the one who said you wanted to come along, right?

266
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,570
I had a terrible dream.

267
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,770
A dream?

268
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,870
Gin found me on my way back from school.

269
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,970
I was cornered into a back alley and...

270
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,870
You were the first one to get shot.

271
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,370
And with the dry sound of the pistol going off,

272
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,070
people were killed one after the other.

273
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,170
Yes.

274
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,570
Just because they were all involved with me.

275
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,470
Maybe I should've been executed by them

276
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,570
right there and then.

277
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,270
Do you know?

278
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,070
You wear that and nobody can tell who you are!

279
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,870
Even Clark Kent would be surprised too.

280
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,370
Then you, who took off his glasses, would be superman?

281
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,170
Except, I can't fly.

282
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,070
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

283
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,670
Thank you.

284
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,370
You've seriously got a bad personality.

285
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,670
But, Gin.

286
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,370
I wonder if she's really going to be there?

287
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,570
Yeah.

288
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,470
She's that kind of chick.

289
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,570
She'll try and stop the poison from being used.

290
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,670
Unaware that we will be waiting for her.

291
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,570
What if she doesn't come?

292
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,570
At least I know that she's hiding in the Beika Town vicinity.

293
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,170
If we find a clue as to where she lives,

294
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,770
hunting her down is no problem,

295
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,570
because traitors cannot cover their smell up.

296
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,470
Indeed a farewell party for a master.

297
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,670
Look at all the big shots.

298
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,670
"Mika Nanjo (38) -A woman novelist, winner of the Ueki Award.

304
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,270
And? Did you figure out who Pisco's target is?

305
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,070
Yeah. Gin was saying in the phone that

306
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,970
the target would be here around 6 pm

307
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,570
and is someone on the wanted list of the police.

308
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,470
It's got to be that guy who is surrounded by reporters

309
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,970
at the entrance.

310
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,870
I see.

"Shigehiko Nomiguchi (56)" -The politician

who made the headlines sweating,

while justifying himself.

314
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,470
If they want to shut him up before he is nabbed,

315
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,870
could he be a member of the organization too?

316
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,070
I wonder.

317
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,970
We'll find out when he's nabbed.

318
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,670
Please explain it so we understand!

319
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,370
Will you excuse me?

320
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,470
What? Inspector Megure.

321
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,970
I called him from the restroom a while ago,

322
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,770
using my voice changer.

323
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,070
I told him that somebody

324
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,170
is after the life of that politician.

325
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,970
Now what, Pisco?

326
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,170
You couldn't possibly assassinate someone

327
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,170
under this condition, could you?

328
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,670
If you intend to carry out your mission aggressively,

329
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,370
I'll put you to sleep with this gun of mine!

Slideshow?

Now, can anyone tell me

336
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,370
where and when this film was taken?

337
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,070
Hey, that politician is leaving!

338
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,070
What?

339
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,670
Hey, hurry up and look for him!

340
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,870
Yes, sir!

341
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,970
Darn it, where on earth is he?

342
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,070
Where'd he go?

343
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,670
Yes.

344
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,570
This is one of Director Sakamaki's major films!

345
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,870
The one that received various awards,

346
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,870
the filming of "The Rainbow Colored Handkerchief".

347
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,470
This is an important slide of the time

348
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,970
the director's hair was still fluffy.

349
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,470
-How is it? -No, we can't find him yet!

350
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,870
Look closer!

351
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,870
Yes, sir!

352
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,370
Let's go on to the next picture.

353
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,170
What? This looks to be

354
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,170
a snapshot of lunch they are having in between filming.

355
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,270
Although I'm pretty sure you're all familiar.

356
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,170
Director Sakamaki used to love soba!

357
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,570
Since the filming of

358
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,470
the "Rainbow Colored Handkerchief" was in Shinshu,

359
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,170
every day at lunch time, he would go here and there

360
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,070
to try out one soba restaurant after another.

361
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,870
By the time filming ended,

362
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,570
it is said that he used to say gregariously that

363
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,770
"All the soba shops in Shinshu are mine."

364
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,070
Let's go on to the next slide!

365
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,270
A flash?

366
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,070
Oh, I know how precious the picture is,

367
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,270
but it won't come out if you use a flash unit!

368
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,470
What's that?

369
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,370
What was that sound?

370
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,570
Above?

371
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,070
-What the... -What was that sound?

372
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,570
Hey, what's up?

373
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,870
What was that sound?

374
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,770
Hurry, turn the lights on!

375
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,070
What is going on, anyway?

376
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,670
What is happening?

377
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,870
What happened?

378
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,470
A handkerchief?

379
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,100
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
"Handkerchief"

381
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,660
In the next episode Haibara is in real trouble.

382
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,860
Are you aware that you're in trouble too?

383
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,120
-What about me? -You don't.
