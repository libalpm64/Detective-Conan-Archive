1
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:05,985
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,121
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:09,721
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:12,621
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,995
We succeeded in getting Kir or Rena Mizunashi

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,321
to serve as a source of information concerning the Organization,

7
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,721
but this turns out to be way riskier than we could imagine.

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,005
The president of a foreign talent production company

9
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:29,221
is murdered at New Beika Hotel.

10
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,821
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -Four suspects are his secretary Ms. Irina Palmer.

11
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,521
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -English teacher, Mr. Hal Buckner.

12
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,021
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Model, Mr. Toby Keynes.

13
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:42,021
"Andre Camel, age 27" -And surprisingly, agent Camel of the FBI.

14
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:45,021
The message President Sunouchi seems to have written

15
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,321
just before passing away,

16
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,021
that the killer seems to have taken with him,

17
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,821
"Jodie Starling" -said this...

18
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,821
Bring my tux.

19
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:55,721
Bring my tuxedo please.

20
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,521
Just what does this dying message mean?

21
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,821
Just then, agent Akai of the FBI receives a call.

22
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:08,421
-Yes. -It's me, Rena Mizunashi.

23
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,221
Well, the thing is I don't feel comfortable here.

24
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,721
I want to get out of here, so I want you to help me.

25
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,821
"Gin"

26
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:20,521
I'll send you the time and place later by email, then.

27
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,061
Yeah.

28
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,821
"James Black" -Was that Rena Mizunashi?

29
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,065
Yes.

30
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:29,721
She wants me to meet her now, just the two of us.

31
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,121
If she's saying just the two of you,

32
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:32,721
it could be a trap.

33
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,921
I'd advise you not to go.

34
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,075
Yes.

35
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,521
If it is a trap though,

36
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:39,721
if I don't go,

37
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,721
there's a ten to one chance that they'll kill her.

38
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,821
She's being suspected by the Organization.

39
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,721
But...

40
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,089
I'll be fine.

41
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:53,821
I pride myself for having pretty sharp hunches.

42
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:56,821
She is an agent of the CIA,

43
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,097
so I'm sure she's thought up something

44
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,221
to make it through this too.

45
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,421
At any rate, let's call Jodie

46
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,103
and think of what we as FBI agents can do...

47
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,321
What seems to be the matter?

48
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,821
Sizzling hot suspense.

49
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,421
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

50
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,133
The members of the Youth Detective Squad burst into laughter.

51
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,921
At the magic words that discloses the culprit.

52
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,421
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,021
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:41,021
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

55
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:15,094
"Red and Black Crash: Desperation"

56
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:18,894
That's what the report from Chiba said.

57
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:21,194
As a result of the investigation,

58
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,894
it has been found that Irina

59
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,194
who is not able to sufficiently read and write Japanese

60
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:29,699
was corresponding with the president in English.

61
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,205
It has been confirmed that Hal is working

62
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,905
as an English teacher at a prep school nearby.

63
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:37,505
Toby is working as a fashion model.

64
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:40,591
All this has been verified as true.

65
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:45,794
As to Camel, we will believe agent Jodie's words,

66
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:48,794
claiming that he is a FBI agent.

67
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,294
That will be all as far as we're concerned.

68
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:53,894
Oh, but please wait a little while more!

69
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:58,277
Hey, did you solve the thing about the memo?

70
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,094
That's still under investigation.

71
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,281
Memo?

72
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,294
She's talking about the dining message, right?

73
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:07,894
I think you meant to say dying message, Genta.

74
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:09,694
That...

75
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,794
If we're just going to have to wait here,

76
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:14,293
I'd like to be given permission to leave for about two hours.

77
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,294
The class that I'm in charge of is scheduled to start pretty soon.

78
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:18,594
Me too.

79
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:21,594
May I leave to go to the hotel reception?

80
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:24,894
I've got to do a lot of canceling and stuff.

81
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:27,794
Besides, maybe I'll get to find out something

82
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,694
about the person the president was scheduled to meet today too.

83
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,311
I guess so.

84
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,594
I think it'll be okay

85
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:34,594
if you're escorted by a police officer?

86
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,694
As for Hal,

87
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,994
I'll have to ask you to cancel today's class.

88
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:42,994
If so, I'd like to tell the prep school head

89
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,794
the reason I'm not teaching today in person

90
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,794
since it's really nearby.

91
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,294
Yes.

92
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,694
-Chiba. -He will escort Irina

93
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:58,337
and he will accompany Hal.

94
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,894
Let's go, then.

95
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,094
I mean there's a dead man here

96
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:06,345
and they're more concerned about their class and party.

97
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:09,094
Some nerve.

98
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,594
Don't you think so, Inspector?

99
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,353
I see. That's the story.

100
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,794
That's why the killer took the memo with him.

101
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,894
-What the heck! -Huh? What's wrong?

102
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:24,094
I figured that maybe Shu would be able

103
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:26,365
to figure out the meaning of the tuxedo memo,

104
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,367
but my cell phone hasn't been working well since this morning

105
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,894
and I can't get through.

106
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,371
Jodie?

107
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,194
I'll lend you my cell phone for a while then.

108
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,394
You don't mind?

109
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:40,094
The email addresses and phone numbers are in here, aren't they?

110
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:41,894
It's okay.

111
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:44,383
As for the mails, I moved the data the other day.

112
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:45,294
And as to the phone numbers,

113
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,494
as long as I pull out the SIM card,

114
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:48,994
no one can look at them.

115
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,391
If you insert the SIM card of your cell phone,

116
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,394
it'll become your cell phone.

117
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:58,694
Since my cell phone is the same type as yours.

118
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,994
But won't it be inconvenient for you,

119
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,401
not having your cell phone?

120
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,894
No problem.

121
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:06,194
Because I have another one.

122
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:07,594
Thank you.

123
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,694
Then, I'll use it for now.

124
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,994
But, doesn't it seem kind of strange?

125
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:15,094
On the outside, it's changed and of a different shape,

126
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:16,994
yet the contents of the cell phone

127
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:19,594
is what you've been using for a long time and know very well.

128
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:23,194
-Huh? -Just what're you talking about?

129
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,794
You know...

130
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:28,427
Just like Mr. Camel who was actually a FBI agent,

131
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:31,394
we should never judge anything by its cover.

132
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,194
Thank you.

133
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:37,094
Thanks to you, I've solved the mystery of that memo.

134
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,994
I hate to butt in when you're all elated,

135
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:43,294
but will you explain it so that a man like me can understand it too?

136
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:47,194
Okay, I'll explain.

137
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:50,094
There's a magic spell

138
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,194
that will tell you who the culprit is at once.

139
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,794
Magic spell?

140
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,394
Are you saying that chanting that spell

141
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,294
will reveal the culprit?

142
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:58,457
Yep.

143
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,494
Although we need to get a lot of things ready.

144
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:02,994
Ready?

145
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:05,794
First we need chairs for the number of people involved.

146
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,994
That's all you have to say.

147
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,194
Easy, right?

148
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:14,473
Are you really sure, we can find the culprit by doing so?

149
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,294
Yep. I'm sure because it's a magic spell

150
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,294
that Shinichi told me about.

151
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,094
Try it.

152
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:22,494
If Kudo's the one who said so,

153
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:24,094
it just might work.

154
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:25,494
Hey, Conan.

155
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:28,487
What's the spell that will reveal the culprit?

156
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,994
Tell us...

157
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,894
That's why all we need to say in front of the suspects is...

158
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:39,294
Liar.

159
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,499
You gotta be kidding.

160
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,494
If that will reveal the culprit,

161
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,503
who needs the police?

162
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:47,094
That's what I figured they'd say.

163
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,794
So what is it you're really supposed to say?

164
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,194
Tell us, without putting us on.

165
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,994
I mean, I'm serious. That's what to say.

166
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,194
Officer Takagi.

167
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,594
Huh?

168
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:02,194
Just watch.

169
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:05,494
Will you go get four chairs for the four suspects?

170
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,594
Oh, but I think it would be better for them to come to the station

171
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,394
if we're going to interrogate them.

172
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:10,529
No.

173
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,531
It's to determine who the culprit is.

174
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,794
As long as they're there, it will become obvious.

175
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,894
What? Really?

176
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:20,539
Yeah, most probably.

177
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,894
"Haido Central Hospital"

178
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,894
Tonight at 19:00.

179
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:42,294
Raiha Pass where the seventh left curve ends.

180
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:43,594
At this hour of the night,

181
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:46,565
there aren't many cars going by that pass.

182
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:51,294
Just the perfect place for a secret meeting.

183
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,573
Are you sure, you're going to be okay?

184
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:58,094
Yes, please believe me.

185
00:09:58,094 --> 00:09:59,794
And, of course, her.

186
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,194
Akai.

187
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,694
Okay, then, please take care of things.

188
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,094
I'm counting on you.

189
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:16,194
Yeah.

190
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:46,350
Inspector Megure, everything's set in place.

191
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,850
Okay.

192
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,050
Will the four suspects go

193
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,150
and stand in front of your respective chairs?

194
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,250
What're you going to do?

195
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,550
It's kind of scary.

196
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,637
If you're going to interrogate us,

197
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,639
wouldn't one to a room be better?

198
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,150
Well, let's do as the Inspector says.

199
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,950
It's not like he's going to ask us to play musical chair

200
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,650
or anything so.

201
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,650
Oh, please don't sit yet.

202
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,250
I wonder if he's really going to say that magic spell?

203
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,653
No, he won't.

204
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,150
He'll be the laughing stock if he does.

205
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,350
Now that all four of you are here, first...

206
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,250
Shiraunplee!

207
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,650
How come you guys are all sitting down?

208
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,650
Oh, because the Inspector just said...

209
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,150
Sit down please.

210
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,950
That's what the word Shiraunplee sounds like

211
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,350
to the ears of foreigners

212
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,723
who are used listening to English.

213
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,550
It sounds like the English.

214
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,050
Sit down please.

215
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,150
More so, if they're standing in front of chairs.

216
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,950
In other words, he looks like a foreigner,

217
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,750
but he's Japanese inside.

218
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,741
And, if the person is not used to hearing English,

219
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,050
it would sound like what it's really supposed to mean,

220
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,550
that is the Japanese word play innocent.

221
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,749
Do you know what this means?

222
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:51,850
Mr. murderer.

223
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,550
-Murderer? -Him?

224
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,950
-Why? -Agent Jodie...

225
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,350
I still don't understand what is going on.

226
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,950
Neither do I.

227
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,450
Let me go over the case, okay?

228
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,550
The one who was shot

229
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,450
is the president of a foreigner's talent production.

230
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,650
From the fact that the president was supposed to meet

231
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,250
a new foreign talent today.

232
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,350
Because the police arrived to the site of the scene right away,

233
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,850
there were four suspects,

234
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,350
his secretary, Irina who was the first to find him.

235
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,250
Then foreigners who were in this hotel at the time of the crime,

236
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,450
English teacher, Mr. Hal Buckner.

237
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,950
Mr. Toby Keynes, the model.

238
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,050
And for some reason, the man who was training on the stairs,

239
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,750
FBI agent, Mr. Andre Camel.

240
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,550
The clue is the thing that was on top the president's desk,

241
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,250
a memo paper that had been torn off.

242
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,250
Because there were blood stains

243
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,150
on the president's hand and the edge of the memo,

244
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,550
it was deduced that the president wrote something just before he died,

245
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,350
and that memo was taken away by the murderer.

246
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,750
And from the traces of what was left on the paper below the memo,

247
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,650
the words, bring my tux.

248
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,832
The phrase please bring my tuxedo was thought out.

249
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:07,136
According to his secretary, Irina,

250
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:10,436
the president was scheduled to attend a party today

251
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:13,736
and the memo was probably a message

252
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,936
that the president had left for her.

253
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:18,236
You already understand, don't you?

254
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:22,036
So, why did the killer take a plain memo away?

255
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:23,336
I get it!

256
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:25,436
It's because he couldn't read the English!

257
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:28,836
The murder couldn't understand the memo,

258
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,936
so he got scared and took it with him.

259
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:35,536
It's most likely that after the murderer shot the president,

260
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,936
he was looking for something,

261
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:39,736
but realized that the president

262
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:43,836
was holding a pen and a memo paper.

263
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:46,536
Thinking that something had been written about himself,

264
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,236
the killer hastily tore off the memo sheet and took it with him.

265
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:53,136
However, the president was already dead at that time.

266
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,436
If it were a person who could read English,

267
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,875
he could see right away

268
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,877
that it was just a message to the president's secretary.

269
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,736
In other words, the man who teaches English at a prep school,

270
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,636
Mr. Hal Buckner,

271
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,036
and the secretary who was corresponding with the president in English,

272
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:07,536
Irina,

273
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:11,436
and FBI agent, Mr. Camel can all be marked off the suspect list.

274
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:14,536
The one who most probably walked off with the memo sheet

275
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:16,895
is the man who is presumed to not have been able to read English,

276
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,897
Mr. Toby Keynes.

277
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,536
He's the only likely one left.

278
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,536
Where's the proof?

279
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:30,909
Don't tell me that you're going to make a murderer out of me

280
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,536
just because I don't understand English?

281
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:37,336
What would you guys do?

282
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,919
If you see a memo sheet with bad things written about you on it.

283
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,936
I'd probably throw it away as soon as I pick it up.

284
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,536
I'd be pissed.

285
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:46,925
I wouldn't even want to read it.

286
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,636
But, what if it was written in a code

287
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:51,436
or something that you don't understand?

288
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,636
Then, I would never throw it away.

289
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:56,436
I'd be concerned about what's written.

290
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,936
I'd take it home and check up on in.

291
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,036
Then the murderer most probably...

292
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,136
Excuse me, let me check you.

293
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,736
Here it is!

294
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:12,736
Inspector!

295
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,236
I was going to take it home

296
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:22,036
and ask my American girlfriend's younger brother

297
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:25,836
what was written on it.

298
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:27,336
Girlfriend?

299
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,236
Yeah, my girlfriend.

300
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:31,236
I can't ask her directly anymore,

301
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:33,536
because after being slave driven by the president,

302
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:39,636
she died at the end of last year from over work.

303
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,236
Slave-driven?

304
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:42,981
Right.

305
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,536
She was made to sign a contract that was written in Japanese.

306
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,936
She could speak a little Japanese,

307
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:52,136
but couldn't read at all.

308
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,336
Moreover, it was a contract binding her brother as joint guarantor,

309
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:59,736
to take full responsibility if she ended up not being able to work.

310
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,536
So, I came here wanting to at least save her younger brother

311
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:03,736
and threatened the president with a gun,

312
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:07,005
hoping to get hold of the contract.

313
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,536
I made him scout me out in the city.

314
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:13,936
He had the nerve to say that he didn't have the contract

315
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:17,015
and he'd have his secretary bring it over,

316
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:20,536
so I inadvertently ended up pulling the trigger.

317
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:21,536
Which means...

318
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:25,036
that the file the president asked me to get was...

319
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:29,536
Yeah, the contract she signed should also be in it.

320
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:33,436
If I knew that his secretary was a girl like you,

321
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:36,436
I guess I didn't have to kill him.

322
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:41,936
But that Shiraunplee thing really got me.

323
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,436
How did you figure it out?

324
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,636
That I'm a foreign looking man who is 100% Japanese,

325
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:48,636
unable to speak a word of English?

326
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:49,636
Reception.

327
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,836
Huh?

328
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,051
Reception.

329
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:57,055
When the secretary left saying she was going to the hotel's reception,

330
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,736
Toby, you said...

331
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,936
I mean there's a dead man here

332
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:07,065
and they're more concerned about their class and party.

333
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,067
Some nerve.

334
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:13,336
Right. When a foreigner says hotel's reception,

335
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:16,436
it's equivalent to the front desk of a hotel in Japanese.

336
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:20,436
That's how I figured out you couldn't speak English, Toby.

337
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,548
It means the front desk.

338
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:26,152
I thought that something wasn't right.

339
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,452
Looking back at things,

340
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:31,852
maybe I should've had my American father teach me more English.

341
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:35,452
All I learned from my father was how to shoot a gun.

342
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,552
How to shoot a gun?

343
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:42,452
Yeah, because he belong to the US-Japan troop

344
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,252
stationed here in Japan.

345
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:46,552
Although my father didn't want to,

346
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:47,852
when we went on a trip to Guam,

347
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,652
I begged him to teach me.

348
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:55,959
But, I wish he taught me more...

349
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,869
of what shooting a person,

350
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,369
and what the consequences could be.

351
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:03,469
I never ever want to go through this again.

352
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,123
Every time I pull the trigger,

353
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,969
it feels like I'm losing my soul

354
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:10,569
that super revolting feeling.

355
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,151
"Mouri Detective Agency"

356
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:18,932
Conan and dad really are like fired bullets

357
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,136
that never come back once they go out.

358
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:24,336
No dinner for them tonight.

359
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,936
New York.

360
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,336
FBI?

361
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:36,336
Come to think of it, that person I met back then was also...

362
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:44,736
A Japanese person with long hair?

363
00:19:57,436 --> 00:19:59,836
What? A gun?

364
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,936
My body...

365
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,636
won't move.

366
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:07,836
Hey, hurry up!

367
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:11,189
Jump in! He must be the serial killer!

368
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,191
But...

369
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:17,195
Shinichi's still inside.

370
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,136
What the...

371
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,536
Oh, hey...

372
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:23,636
Are you Japanese?

373
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,836
I'm asking you, are you Japanese?

374
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,209
Oh, yes.

375
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,936
Did you see a suspicious looking man?

376
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:34,436
Huh?

377
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:38,736
A Japanese man with long hair dyed silver.

378
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,736
No, nobody like that.

379
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:45,836
Did you find him, sir?

380
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:47,636
No.

381
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:49,227
At any rate, this place is dangerous.

382
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:51,229
Turn right on the corner over there

383
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,536
and you'll come out to the main street.

384
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:54,336
Hail a cab there.

385
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,136
Oh, but I'm waiting here for my friend.

386
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:01,239
He's a high school sophomore like me.

387
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,236
Let me tell you as well as that friend again.

388
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,736
Get lost! Get out of here, quick!

389
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:21,736
He was a FBI agent.

390
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:23,936
And once more...

391
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:34,836
You're crying again.

392
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,536
Huh?

393
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:39,836
You're always crying.

394
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:42,236
Does it bother you?

395
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:44,436
No.

396
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:48,436
You just remind me...

397
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:50,536
of a woman who closely resembled you.

398
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:55,293
A stupid woman who feigned composure,

399
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,736
but used to cry when no one was watching.

400
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:02,436
A woman who closely resembles me.

401
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:05,303
I wonder who he was referring to.

402
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:14,436
Do I have to tell you how I feel, for you to understand?

403
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,423
Bullet.

405
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,427
Everybody, don't forget FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

406
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,429
What do you mean?
