1
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:07,987
This is delicious.

2
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:13,156
Drinking beer in day time is exceptionally fantastic.

3
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:19,556
Are you Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

4
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:21,756
You want my autograph? Sure.

5
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:25,056
No, there's a call for you, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:26,856
Oh, thank you.

7
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,556
Yes, hello?

8
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:32,011
Hey there, famed detective. Long time no see.

9
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:34,013
Who are you?

10
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,556
How sad that you should forget me.

11
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,056
It's me. I'm Mr. Reiji Himuro.

12
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,256
Himuro?

13
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:44,456
Don't tell me that you're that Himuro.

14
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,456
Hey, you. Just what do you think you're doing?

15
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,456
It's so nice

16
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:52,031
to be with your children, so peaceful.

17
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,656
What do you want?

18
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:58,356
Thanks to you, somebody's going to die.

19
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,039
What?

20
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,956
Oh, no.

21
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,356
Aim for a 100% solution.

22
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,756
Clear all mysteries and codes.

23
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:22,656
A trap that was rigged with a weird alibi.

24
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:24,856
Kogoro Mouri is in dire straits.

25
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:26,356
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:28,356
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,656
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:14,751
"The Famed Detective is Framed".

29
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,451
Pops, over there!

30
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,651
Darn! Don't you dare move from there, Himuro!

31
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,651
Dad!

32
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,751
Excuse me, miss. Your bill.

33
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:45,651
"Reiji Himuro (40)" -I was looking outside

34
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,207
"Previously a bank robber" -when I happened to see you.

35
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,551
I felt nostalgic that I decided to call you.

36
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,851
Cut out the joke!

37
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,851
What was that call a while ago about?

38
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,951
Where and who's going to die?

39
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,851
If that's what you're concerned about, it's already too late.

40
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,651
What? What do you mean?

41
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,223
Dad, no!

42
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,951
-Hey, isn't that Kogoro Mouri? -Why you, what are you up to?

43
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:15,951
Darn! So, this is what he wants.

44
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:20,751
The victim is Mr. Shingo Numao, age 35.

45
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,241
He's an auto mechanic,

46
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,851
working at an auto repair factory called Taiyo Motors in 3-Beika-cho.

47
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,651
He died of an impact throughout his entire body

48
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,247
and virtually died on the spot.

49
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,751
-He fell from there? -Yes.

50
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,251
How about it, Chiba?

51
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,751
No mistake about it.

52
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:38,257
He fell from here.

53
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,751
The railing is corroded and part of it is missing.

54
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,051
But, there are no signs of a struggle.

55
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,251
I see.

56
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,551
"Morgue"

57
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,851
"Shingo Numao (35), Previously a bank robber" -Numao.

58
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:53,151
Is it you?

59
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,551
Do you know him, Dad?

60
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,951
Yeah.

61
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:01,551
I arrested that guy Himuro after getting info from Numao.

62
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,451
Reiji Himuro.

63
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:08,287
He was a notorious bank robber.

64
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,751
I see. If I remember correctly, Numao was...

65
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,291
Yes.

66
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,551
He used to be Himuro's accomplice, rather his henchman.

67
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,297
He was virtually a dogsbody.

68
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,299
He listened to my advice telling him

69
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:26,305
to quit being a yes man for such a scum.

70
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:32,051
Numao, I'm sure you can start over.

71
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,251
Believe me

72
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,851
and tell me what you know about Himuro.

73
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:38,317
I think that's right.

74
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:43,351
It's a bummer being used by that scum forever, right?

75
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:47,751
It doesn't worth to be made an accomplice of a homicide because of him.

76
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:49,051
Homicide?

77
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:50,651
No.

78
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,331
I just thought that if I continued doing what I'm doing now,

79
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,951
I'd eventually turn out that way.

80
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,951
So, where's Himuro now?

81
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,551
In the interrogation room.

82
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,343
Officer Sato is hearing him out now.

83
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,851
He used to be an easy mark, who fell for anything from before.

84
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:13,151
Therefore, he got away with probation,

85
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:17,351
while I was jailed for ages.

86
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:19,451
It's good to know that that he's not around anymore.

87
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,851
Cut it out!

88
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,651
Weren't you the one who did it?

89
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:24,751
According to Mr. Mouri...

90
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,851
How?

91
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:30,369
So, when did Numao die?

92
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,151
At about 3:40 PM.

93
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,851
3:40 PM?

94
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:38,377
If I remember correctly at that time, I was at Hokubu Department Store

95
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:42,381
and grabbed by the collar by a certain famous detective.

96
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:46,385
Then, embarrassed him in front of the public.

97
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,951
Just as would be expected of a famed detective.

98
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,751
He's really reliable.

99
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,751
I'm counting on you to testify my alibi.

100
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:58,751
If so, how'd you know that he was going to die?

101
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,951
I guess you can call it telepathy.

102
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:02,751
Darn!

103
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,403
-Wait. -Mr. Mouri!

104
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,451
Himuro! How dare you!

105
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,751
Mr. Mouri!

106
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,409
I'll bet you killed him beforehand

107
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,751
and set him up to somehow fall to his death. Isn't that right?

108
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,051
No, Mr. Mouri!

109
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:19,651
You... What right do you have to grab me by my collar?

110
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,419
What?

111
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,421
Mr. Mouri!

112
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,851
Hey, let me go, will you?

113
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,951
Enough, Mr. Mouri.

114
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,951
But Inspector...

115
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,851
Well then,

116
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:37,951
since this voluntary interrogation's over without hassle,

117
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:40,439
I guess I'll leave now.

118
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,551
"A Famed Detective Disgraces Himself"

119
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,651
"Detective Goes On A Rampage In Broad Daylight!"

120
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,651
"The Eyes Of A Lunatic"

121
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:14,851
What's this about the websites flooded with comments?

122
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,051
I don't care about it!

123
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,951
I'm an incompetent, fumbling detective!

124
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,951
What do you mean, Inspector?

125
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:30,489
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, Mouri!

126
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:33,551
On what charges are we supposed to arrest him on?

127
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,251
That's...

128
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,751
Futhermore,

129
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:41,051
you publicly assaulted a person who's not even a suspect

130
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,151
and tried to charge him.

131
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,251
If things came to worse,

132
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:47,651
we have to arrest you, understand?

133
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:50,851
You mean you feel that way too, Inspector?

134
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:52,851
I don't feel that way.

135
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,551
Still, that's how society sees it.

136
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,951
He provoked you. You fell for it

137
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,951
and now you've lost your control.

138
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:01,851
Take time off for a while.

139
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:12,051
Dad.

140
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,551
I understand how you feel, but you're drinking too much.

141
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:23,651
There. That's the cafe where we were at.

142
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,545
It's much too far to find it coincidentally.

143
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,651
No doubt about it.

144
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:32,851
He was on his guard, watching for Pops from way before that.

145
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:36,555
Conan?

146
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,851
Where's Mr. Mouri?

147
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:40,251
He said that he had to go check somewhere else,

148
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:43,151
so he told me to tell you to check on this side.

149
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:44,551
I see.

150
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,551
I'm relieved to hear that.

151
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:50,551
I was worried because the media was really bashing him.

152
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,051
He's fine.

153
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,251
He's all out to clear his name.

154
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:58,051
By the way, will everything be okay on your side, Officer Takagi?

155
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,351
Cooperating with Pops.

156
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:04,583
Yeah. After all, Mr. Mouri's always helping us out.

157
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,585
So, doing this much is nothing.

158
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,051
Around here?

159
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,851
Yes.

160
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,451
A little more before would be better.

161
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,651
-Before? -Before, I see.

162
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:23,551
Right there.

163
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:25,351
Can you show me from a little before that?

164
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,451
Hey, can we look at the floor below here?

165
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:36,615
Yeah.

166
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:40,619
Around here?

167
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,251
It's Himuro.

168
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:50,629
-What lies beyond that? -It's the men's restroom.

169
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,351
He's coming back.

170
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,251
Hey, what's that?

171
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,651
The one to the right edge of the screen.

172
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,751
Oh, that? Probably a microphone.

173
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:05,351
They had a public radio recording there last night.

174
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,651
Over here?

175
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,151
I heard they're having a recording today too.

176
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,151
Yeah, but it doesn't look as if Himuro came here

177
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:17,251
because he had something to do.

178
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:18,657
Officer Takagi.

179
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,851
There's one more thing he asked me to ask you to check on.

180
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,151
One more thing?

181
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,051
Thank you for waiting.

182
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:30,151
I'm officer Eguchi from the Beika police station.

183
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,251
Good work.

184
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,671
And...

185
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:33,951
Conan?

186
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,151
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you again.

187
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,351
About what?

188
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,151
Why'd you come here to begin with?

189
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:48,151
The fact is, I got word while I was on patrol.

190
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:51,551
That a suspicious person was inside this building.

191
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:53,651
This building is under destruction

192
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:56,151
because there's danger of it coming down.

193
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:58,697
So, I rushed over here and found...

194
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,051
Hey, you! Watch out!

195
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,251
Gosh.

196
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,151
Who gave out this info?

197
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,851
It seems he didn't say his name.

198
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,251
And when his number was re-dialed, there was no answer.

199
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,151
I thought that it may be a prank.

200
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:23,751
The call is recorded, right?

201
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,051
So that maybe a voice check can be carried out?

202
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,727
I see! Maybe it was Himuro.

203
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:32,151
I'll contact the command and control center, as well as the forensics.

204
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:37,551
I wonder why Mr. Numao came to a place like this.

205
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:41,351
-You didn't see anyone else, did you? -No.

206
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,251
Yes, Takagi here.

207
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:46,751
There's something I want you to confirm for me.

208
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,351
Yes, that's right.

209
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,851
What I want you to confirm is

210
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:54,753
about a call from an informant that came in yesterday at around 13:30.

211
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:57,651
-A phone call! -A phone call?

212
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,759
Yes, I just remember it.

213
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,551
It did seem like he was talking to someone on the cell phone.

214
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,051
Strange.

215
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,251
Mr. Numao who fell didn't have a cell phone,

216
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,651
and there was none near the corpse either.

217
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,151
Maybe he disposed it before he fell.

218
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:18,251
Maybe he had some incoming call history that he didn't want anybody to see.

219
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:21,351
Okay. Let's expand the area of search and look for it.

220
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,351
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,351
It's all rusty.

222
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,451
That was close!

223
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:48,551
This is...

224
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,151
I get it.

225
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:53,651
That's how it is.

226
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,851
I found it! I found it!

227
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,551
I found it on the ground over here!

228
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:13,853
Even if we were able to get Mr. Numao's fingerprints from this cell phone,

229
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,953
being thrown over to such a distance,

230
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:19,253
it's questionable whether the data is left undamaged.

231
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,253
Right.

232
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:22,841
Just now Pops called to say

233
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,453
to check closer to the part where the railing broke off.

234
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:28,847
Okay!

235
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,753
Wait a second.

236
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,653
Himuro, back then...

237
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:37,153
If so, maybe he put it there.

238
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,253
Conan?

239
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:34,913
Found it!

240
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,919
Attention to all customers.

241
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,053
We will be having the public radio recording...

242
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,923
But the possibility of the incoming and outgoing calls history

243
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,353
being damaged are high.

244
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:49,253
Isn't there any other evidence?

245
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,929
It will be held on the second-floor event square of this store.

246
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,653
I repeat.

247
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:55,353
We will be having the public radio recording of Gogoraji

248
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:58,053
-that we also had yesterday. -Okay, when I give you the signal,

249
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:00,939
please applaud!

250
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,253
Maybe...

251
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,553
Yes, Megure here.

252
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:18,753
Hello, Inspector. This is Mouri.

253
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:21,453
I have a favor to ask you.

254
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:25,453
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad. You have a call from Inspector Megure.

255
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,753
Hello.

256
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,969
What can I do for you, Inspector?

257
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:34,653
Himuro?

258
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:37,553
Calling me out like this without a warrant.

259
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,753
Are you the one who did this?

260
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:41,853
No. I...

261
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,953
What is the meaning of this, Inspector?

262
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:46,153
What are you talking about?

263
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:48,653
You asked me to bring him in

264
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:50,453
because you'd prove the crime he committed.

265
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,153
-Mouri? -Dad!

266
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:58,453
So, this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

267
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,253
Let me start from the conclusion.

268
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:05,753
He used the cell phone to manipulate Shingo Numao,

269
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:09,007
and made him fall to his death from the emergency stairs.

270
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:13,011
Can you conclude that it wasn't an accident?

271
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,653
Yes, of course.

272
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,353
The emergency stairs of this building,

273
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:21,353
partway to the 4th floor has a large hole.

274
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,021
If you try to step over it,

275
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,453
your hand would naturally grab the railing on the left side.

276
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:31,029
However, if that railing were to be corroded and frail...

277
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,653
Here's a hole in your unfounded accusation.

278
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:40,453
Is it my fault that the railing was rusted?

279
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,353
Right, it's your fault.

280
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,553
What?

281
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:46,153
Officer Chiba, please explain it to him.

282
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:47,553
Yes, sir.

283
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:51,049
A corrosive agent was painted on the railing.

284
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,653
According to forensics,

285
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,453
if left as is for a week,

286
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:57,053
the railing should shatter to pieces.

287
00:17:57,053 --> 00:18:01,059
Moreover, you mentally cornered Numao.

288
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,553
Officer Takagi.

289
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,153
Okay.

290
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:07,065
When Mr. Himuro was arrested previously,

291
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,553
there was one case that couldn't be proven.

292
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,253
It was the case of two robbers broke into

293
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:15,073
a cooperative bank in Beika 2 chome.

294
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,553
One of the security guards was killed.

295
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:18,853
Hey, hey.

296
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:22,653
Stop making it sound like I'm the culprit to everything that happened.

297
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,083
The two robbers who broke in back then

298
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,653
were Numao and you, weren't you?

299
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,553
You called Numao over to this building

300
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:34,053
and called him to tell that the murder of the security guard was exposed.

301
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,353
And what if a police officer came to the scene

302
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,653
and then shouting something out loud?

303
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:41,099
-Hey, you! Watch out! -I'm sure Numao panicked.

304
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,109
Numao's cell phone

305
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,853
and the cell phone you disposed in the toilet tank at the department store

306
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,653
were already retrieved.

307
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,117
If we check the incoming and outgoing calls history,

308
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,119
we can prove that you committed the crime.

309
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,653
Yes, this is Sato.

310
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:07,653
Yes. Yes, sir.

311
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:09,753
Is that right?

312
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:11,129
It didn't work out.

313
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:13,953
The data of both cell phones were damaged,

314
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,253
and it seems they can't confirm the incoming and outgoing calls history.

315
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:17,553
What about the voiceprint of the person

316
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,553
who called to inform that Numao was in the building?

317
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:22,453
It was changed mechanically.

318
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,553
Good work.

319
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:29,147
Great entertainment indeed.

320
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,153
I see. Your story falls right into place,

321
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:36,053
but with no proof what so ever,

322
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,353
you can't indict me, can you?

323
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,753
Hey, Inspector.

324
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:40,853
I think you should educate

325
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:44,953
that incompetent, fumbling detective of yours.

326
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,165
See you then.

327
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,053
-Dad. -What now, Mouri?

328
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,053
It's not over yet.

329
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,653
We are changing the schedule of today's Gogoraji

330
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:01,179
to the live broadcast of the famed Sleeping Kogoro.

331
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:03,653
He will be presenting his deductions

332
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,183
in order to clear his name.

333
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,153
What took you so long?

334
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:09,653
Let's start then.

335
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,753
At about 3:40 pm yesterday,

336
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,753
what were you doing?

337
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,853
I was at the Hokubu Department Store

338
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:18,453
preparing for the public radio recording.

339
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:19,953
I see.

340
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,453
Then, will you please let us hear

341
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:26,053
the recording you played for the child I sent over once again?

342
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:27,205
Yes, sir.

343
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,653
Mr. Takahashi, will you play it for us?

344
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:33,211
Test, test.

345
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,253
Mic test. Do you hear me?

346
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,653
-Tanaka, is everything okay? -Yes, sir.

347
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,353
What about the microphone in the rear?

348
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:42,753
Yes. It's perfect.

349
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,223
We can't hear anything, can we?

350
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:48,453
Well then, please mute the noise from the crowd in the background.

351
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:49,227
Got it.

352
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:51,853
Test, test.

353
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,453
Mic test. Do you hear me?

354
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,553
The police officer is after you.

355
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:59,237
They are right in front of that building now.

356
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,553
Tanaka, is everything okay?

357
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:01,953
Hurry up, Numao.

358
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:02,953
Yes, sir.

359
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:04,953
Hide on the roof!

360
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,453
What about the microphone in the rear?

361
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,853
Next time you're caught, you'll be sent to prison.

362
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:11,753
No, you'll be sentenced to death.

363
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,553
See you, traitor.

364
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:21,253
Darn! How dare you make a joke out of me?

365
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:26,753
You amateur!

366
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,653
What the...

367
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:30,953
Ran?

368
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:33,753
You scum!

369
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:42,353
Afterwards, Himura confessed to the murder he committed this time

370
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:45,053
and the previous accounts of his crime too.

371
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,353
Pops's name was successfully cleared.

372
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,853
"Mouri Detective Agency"

373
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,553
Come on, Dad.

374
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:21,953
I was about to throw a celebratory party and yet,

375
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:26,053
you've got the nerve to toast all by yourself.

376
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,653
Well, who cares?

377
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:29,387
Let's do it, just two of us, then?

378
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:30,653
Yes.

379
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:34,453
-To the famed detective. -To the famed detective.

380
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,453
To the famed detective.

381
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,753
-Cheers. -Cheers.

382
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:44,453
Cheers!

383
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,600
Next Conan's Hint:

384
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,600
"Veranda".

385
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,816
There's no case that I cannot solve!

386
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:53,936
It's already midnight.

387
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,413
Is this supposed to be a case too?
