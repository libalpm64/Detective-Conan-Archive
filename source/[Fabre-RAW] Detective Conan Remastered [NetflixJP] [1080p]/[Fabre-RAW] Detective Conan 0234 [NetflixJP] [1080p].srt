1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,690
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,090
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,790
Champion dog Doyle disappears.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,090
The real faces of the breeders are revealed.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,350
We visited the residence of Teruya Kanou, a friend of Dr. Agasa

9
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,350
who invited us over because he wanted to give away things

10
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,550
to his friends before moving to England.

11
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,250
At his house, we meet his friends Mr. Yoshio Tsunashima,

12
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,450
Ms. Aki Tosabayashi,

13
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,250
and Ms. Shino Hasuki.

14
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,350
Amidst the exchange of various complicated feelings,

15
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,450
one of the dog

16
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,350
named Doyle disappears out of the blue.

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,550
Moreover,

18
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,050
the burnt black piece of Doyle's collar

19
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,450
that has been cut with a knife is found in the incinerator.

20
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,550
Don't tell me that's...

21
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,350
Doyle's...

22
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,250
It can't be...

23
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,350
Huh?

24
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,550
That's strange.

25
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,150
Just a while ago, there were only two blue cushions.

26
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,450
Counting the one that Arthur brought out makes three blue cushions.

27
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,050
One extra cushion.

28
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,050
What does this all mean?

29
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,250
"The Nonvanishing Evidence (Part 2)"

30
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,850
At the chime when the clock struck 12:00,

31
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,050
Doyle headed for the Japanese room where he could get his snack,

32
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,550
and disappeared from our view.

33
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,650
After that,

34
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,750
we all followed Mr. Kanou who went into the kitchen

35
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,050
to get the cheese snack.

36
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,850
Then we went to the Japanese room and found that Doyle was not there.

37
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,250
So, we split up and looked all over the house for Doyle.

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,650
This is approximately how the layout of the house is.

39
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,050
We don't really know who searched where yet.

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,350
But where on earth did the person hide Doyle?

41
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,850
And how is that person planning to carry Doyle out of here?

42
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,050
I wonder if you're going to get around to prepare for your move.

43
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,550
Yes, but that's okay.

44
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,250
Move?

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,650
You said that you're giving us the things you don't need

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,150
because you're going to be moving away

47
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,850
but can we take the things we want home with us today?

48
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,050
Yes, sure.

49
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,350
Are all the others going to take their things home today, too?

50
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,350
No.

51
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,050
I'm going to send Mr. Tsunashima's clock

52
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,550
to his residence tomorrow.

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,650
Ms. Hasuki's stereo will be sent to her house 10 days later,

54
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,250
which will be the day before I move.

55
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,650
I never use any of the stuff,

56
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,050
so I told them that I could send the goods right away,

57
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,550
but they both came today

58
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,050
because I happened to find more antiques in the closet

59
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,150
and they wanted to take a look.

60
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,050
As for Ms. Tosabayashi who showed up out of the blue today,

61
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,950
judging from her personality and all,

62
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,850
I'm sure she's going to take that flower vase home with her today.

63
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,150
If I remember it correctly, that flower vase in the living room.

64
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,350
Don't tell me that...

65
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,150
Doyle is in that...

66
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,650
Of course, not.

67
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,450
A living creature couldn't possibly be hidden in a stereo

68
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,350
that is supposed to be shipped out 10 days from now either.

69
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,250
The wall clock in the Japanese room...

70
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,350
It's impossible to hide a dog in there either.

71
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,050
Huh? That clock is five minutes slow.

72
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,950
Strange.

73
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,250
After it was repaired, it was always accurate.

74
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,550
Wait a second.

75
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,450
When I looked at it while ago...

76
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,050
What's this cotton like thing?

77
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,050
It looks like some sort of chemical fiber.

78
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,150
Hey, let me see it.

79
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,650
This is...

80
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,850
That glittering cotton was on the blue cushion

81
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,850
that Arthur was holding, too.

82
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,050
Wait a second.

83
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,650
Come to think of it, I've seen this some place, too.

84
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,650
The incinerator!

85
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,750
What's the matter, Conan?

86
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,950
Was Doyle burnt in there?

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,750
When I saw it a while ago, I just thought it was plain trash,

88
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,750
but this is definitely glass wool.

89
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,250
It's sound absorption material.

90
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,750
I see.

91
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,450
That's what the person used.

92
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,150
Conan.

93
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,650
I've figured out where Doyle is hidden

94
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,150
as well as how and why.

95
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,950
I've also figured out who did it, too.

96
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,850
It's this late already.

97
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,150
I've got to get going home.

98
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,650
Me, too.

99
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,350
I have to start getting dinner ready.

100
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,650
Please wait.

101
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,850
Well, I guess you were just unlucky.

102
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,050
I suggest you forget about that doggie.

103
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,950
No way.

104
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,350
This is the sound of...

105
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,650
The sound of the wall clock in the Japanese room.

106
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,750
It's only supposed to ring at 12:00 noon.

107
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,250
What's going on?

108
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,650
Conan?

109
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,850
It worked, Conan!

110
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,150
We'll go get things ready in the living room, then!

111
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,250
Okay!

112
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,950
Get things ready?

113
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,650
We're going to try an experiment

114
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,350
to see if the person who hid Doyle could really do so

115
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,050
without being seen by anyone.

116
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,350
How foolish,

117
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,350
when we haven't even found Doyle yet...

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,450
Of course, the star of the experiment

119
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,850
is Doyle here!

120
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,850
Huh?

121
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,150
Doyle!

122
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,950
You found him!

123
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,550
I'm glad.

124
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,550
Okay, let's start the experiment.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Doyle disappeared from our sight

126
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
from the corridor in front of the front entrance.

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,800
The dog has been found, so isn't that enough?

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,300
I don't have time to be fooling around

129
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
with a child's detectives game either.

130
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,800
Now, now.

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Mitsuhiko, you can start!

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Roger!

133
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,100
Not again.

134
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,200
First, after hearing the chime of the clock,

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Doyle headed for the Japanese room where he usually gets his snack.

136
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
In the meantime, we went to the kitchen

137
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,300
before going to the Japanese room.

138
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,600
Right?

139
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Yes.

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Then, where do you think Doyle is now?

141
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
This is ridiculous!

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
If he was given his snack as usual in the Japanese room,

143
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
where else would he be other than the Japanese room?

144
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,400
Huh?

145
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
He's not here.

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,000
Besides, the sound of the chime did not come from this room.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Oh, really?

148
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,700
What is going on?

149
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,300
Mr. Kanou.

150
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,200
The sound of the clock came from thus living room.

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,700
The living room?

152
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,100
Don't tell me that

153
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,400
the sound was from the speaker of the stereo?

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,900
Yes. We rung the chime of the clock a while ago

155
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,800
recorded it and played it on this stereo.

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,700
I used the tape recorder that was in your room.

157
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Which means that Doyle was lured to the living room

158
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,000
by the sound of the clock.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Just the sound won't do.

160
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,300
The cushion has to be here, too.

161
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,600
Cushion?

162
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,100
Remember, you said that Doyle pulls out

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,100
his own cushion during snack time.

164
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,200
But the blue cushion that Doyle like

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
was in the Japanese room just a while ago.

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,300
Doyle doesn't necessarily like blue cushions.

167
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,500
A dog's ear can hear four times that of humans,

168
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,800
its sense of smell is far more superior than that of humans.

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,500
But its eyes can hardly tell one color from the other.

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,800
That's why Doyle always pulled out the cushion

171
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,900
which had his smell on it at snack time,

172
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,000
and that cushion just happened to be blue.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
In other words,

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,100
Doyle was not waiting in the Japanese room at 12:00 noon.

175
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,200
He was trained to think that

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
if he waited on the cushion near the sound of the chime of the clock,

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,700
he could get his snack.

178
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,400
So, the person who schemed this took advantage of Doyle's habit

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,000
and lured him out to the living room.

180
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,900
The cushion that Doyle always used had bite marks on it,

181
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,500
so it was also easy for the person to tell it apart.

182
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,600
But I came here to living room right away

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,500
with Mr. Tsunashima to look for Doyle,

184
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,000
but saw neither the cushion nor the dog.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
-Isn't that right? -Right.

186
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,200
There's a good place to hide Doyle.

187
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Huh?

188
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Look here, behind the stereo.

189
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,000
He's behind the speaker.

190
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,400
The person peeled off the sound absorption material

191
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,200
that was stuck on to the inside of the speaker beforehand.

192
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,300
Then the person put Doyle's cushion in the space that was made,

193
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,000
and put the cheese on the cushion.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Of course, the right speaker was rigged,

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,400
so no sound came out from it.

196
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
And the left speaker was rigged

197
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,800
so that the sound of the clock that was recorded beforehand

198
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,700
would come out of it.

199
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,900
Then, Doyle would be lured by the smell of the cushion and cheese

200
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
as well as the sound of the clock

201
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,200
went into the right speaker where the back board was open.

202
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
In other words, he was lured inside.

203
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,550
If so, wouldn't he come out after eating the cheese?

204
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,950
He was put to sleep with a sleeping pill

205
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,950
that was buried inside the cheese.

206
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,950
I wonder if it would work out that smoothly.

207
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,350
Back then, the clock in the Japanese room indicated 12:00 noon,

208
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,650
so the real chime should've been ringing, too.

209
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,350
I don't think it rang.

210
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,550
Because it was 12:00 midnight.

211
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,050
Huh?

212
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,950
That clock is made to ring only at 12:00 noon.

213
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,450
If the hands of the clock are moved up 12 hours,

214
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,250
the chime won't ring.

215
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,250
But who would do something like that?

216
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,150
Who else?

217
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,350
It can't be anyone else but Ms. Hasuki

218
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,650
who was going to take this stereo with her, right?

219
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,950
It can't be...

220
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,350
She was probably going to put that doggie in the speaker

221
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,150
and steal it.

222
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,750
No, I would never...

223
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,850
Wait.

224
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,850
Ms. Hasuki would never do a thing like that.

225
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,150
But her shoes were in the yard by the incinerator, too.

226
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,250
-But... -No.

227
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,850
Ms. Hasuki is not the one.

228
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,860
Ms. Hasuki is not the one.

229
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,960
What is this boy talking about?

230
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,160
Because that stereo was going to be sent out on Saturday, right?

231
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,560
No one would look a live dog in a place like that.

232
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,860
If it's not Ms. Hasuki,

233
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,260
why would someone hid the dog in the speaker of the stereo?

234
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,760
The person who did it didn't want to steal Doyle,

235
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
but rather, just wanted Doyle to disappear for a while.

236
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,860
Disappear for a while?

237
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,560
It maybe a blind spot,

238
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
but if the back board of the speaker is removed,

239
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,160
it would easily be noticed.

240
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,360
That's one of the places anyone would look when searching.

241
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,460
Right. That's why the person came here first

242
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,460
to replaced the back board and hid Doyle.

243
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,060
Isn't that right,

244
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,760
Mr. Tsunashima?

245
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,760
Since you said that you came here first thing to look for Doyle,

246
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
it would've been easy for you to pretend that you were searching

247
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
behind the speaker and replace the back board, right?

248
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Come to think of it, you said that

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,960
you looked behind the speaker and didn't come to this side, right?

250
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Hey.

251
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm sure that

252
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,560
you heard about Doyle's snacking habit from Mr. Kanou's parents.

253
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,660
As well as about the stereo not being used much.

254
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,860
And when you came to this house before,

255
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,460
you peeled off the sound absorption material behind the speaker

256
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,960
and had prepared a place to hide Doyle beforehand.

257
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,660
All you had to say was that the speaker didn't sound good to pretend

258
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,260
that you were trying to fix it. Then, nobody would suspect you.

259
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,060
If you were around when Doyle was eating his snack

260
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,160
you could record the sound of the chime, too.

261
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,860
You put the tape and cushion behind the stereo

262
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,760
when Ms. Hasuki came before 12:00,

263
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,560
and we were all gathered at the front entrance.

264
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,160
You then pretended to look for Doyle

265
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,660
and went around behind the speaker.

266
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,460
You removed the collar from Doyle who was asleep.

267
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,360
You also retrieved the cushion and replaced the back board.

268
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,060
You then put the cushion back into the Japanese room.

269
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,660
You returned the hands of the clock that were moved up in time,

270
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,060
back to the accurate time.

271
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,160
You then burned the collar in the incinerator

272
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,660
and left the back door open.

273
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,460
Because you wanted everyone to think that

274
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,760
someone who snuck into the house took Doyle

275
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,360
and fled from the back door.

276
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,060
I see.

277
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
It seems that you wanted to

278
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,960
burn the sound absorption material in the incinerator.

279
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,360
But that's glass wool that is also used as a heat insulator.

280
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Most of it was left in the incinerator without being burned.

281
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,660
I see.

282
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,260
That's why when we made Arthur look for Doyle,

283
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,160
he brought the cushion from the Japanese room.

284
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,660
Because it was Doyle's cushion that was replaced.

285
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,060
But why wasn't Arthur able to tell

286
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,560
that Doyle was inside the speaker?

287
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,160
He knew but he couldn't go inside.

288
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
Because this room was a place where he was scolded in the past

289
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,160
and had bad memories about.

290
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,660
But, sonny,

291
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,060
I gain nothing from hiding Doyle inside the speaker.

292
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,760
What you wanted was not Doyle,

293
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,660
but the thing that was on his collar,

294
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,260
right?

295
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,960
This gem stone.

296
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,360
This is quite an expensive item that

297
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,860
Mr. Kanou grandfather had bought in France.

298
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,160
And where did you find that?

299
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,860
Behind the pendulum of the wall clock in the Japanese room.

300
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,860
When I looked at that clock at 12:00, the time was accurate.

301
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,060
But when I looked at 15:00, it was off 3 minutes,

302
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,960
and when I looked at 17:00, it was off 5 minutes.

303
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,560
The clock continued to delay one minute an hour.

304
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
That's how I found out

305
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,260
there was something attached behind the pendulum

306
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,360
as well as the person who attached it

307
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,660
was the one who was to take the clock home, Mr. Tsunashima.

308
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,460
That person is you!

309
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,560
-Darn it! -Mr. Tsunashima!

310
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,660
Darn it!

311
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,760
Stop it, Arthur!

312
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
You could never hit a dog

313
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,560
because you like dogs, don't you?

314
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,160
That's why you didn't kill Doyle, right?

315
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,960
You didn't screw the back board of the speaker back on

316
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,660
because you wanted Doyle to be able to leave

317
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,860
when he woke up, right?

318
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,260
Isn't that right, Conan?

319
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,660
Mr. Tsunashima, why?

320
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,660
Money.

321
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,860
I wanted money to take care of my dogs

322
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,660
that multiplied beyond expectation.

323
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,960
If so, you could've sold your dogs and reduced the dogs that you owned!

324
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,660
The dogs that I have at home

325
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,560
are mostly mixed breeds that have been abandoned.

326
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,960
Selling them is out of the question.

327
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,060
There is nobody who is willing to take them.

328
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,760
The only path left for them

329
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,060
is to starve to death or be killed by drugs.

330
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,760
They only have one in two choices.

331
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,360
Mr. Tsunashima.

332
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,260
Mr. Tsunashima.

333
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,560
Here.

334
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,660
You may have it.

335
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,960
But...

336
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,760
I'm not giving it to you.

337
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I'm giving it to the dogs that are at your house.

338
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,560
Kanou.

339
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm so sorry.

340
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,160
It's okay.

341
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm sure

342
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,560
my late grandfather would be more than happy to have you take it.

343
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,860
How audacious can you get!

344
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,460
I feel sorry for the dogs that are owned by someone

345
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,960
who cannot handle them!

346
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,360
Come on. After all, he did promise that he'll make sure

347
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
the number of dogs he owns won't increase.

348
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,860
Arthur and Christie were both great, weren't they?

349
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,060
They were like police dogs

350
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,760
when they cornered Mr. Tsunashima who tried to flee.

351
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,860
It's instinct.

352
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,660
All Arthur did was go after the person who pushed his master,

353
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,760
and Christie is a sheep dog to begin with.

354
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,660
Shetland Sheep Dogs are brought up to bring sheep

355
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,460
that have gone astray from the flock

356
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,360
back into the flock.

357
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,160
They have the habit of going around

358
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,360
and stopping anything that suddenly runs off.

359
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Talk about a wet blanket.

360
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,960
I can't figure out

361
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,860
why Ms. Hasuki's shoes were on the ground

362
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,160
near the incinerator.

363
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,060
He's the one responsible.

364
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,860
Hide here a while, will you?

365
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
What are you doing, Conan?

366
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,560
See?

367
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Hey, Arthur!

368
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,560
Since when did you start doing a thing like that?

369
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Hey, Arthur! Are you listening to me?

370
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,660
Arthur!

371
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,560
I wonder if he doesn't like me anymore?

372
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,860
No, he just wants you to stay here forever.

373
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,060
Isn't that right, Arthur?

374
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,360
Remember, you said a while ago that Arthur would bring your shoes

375
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,160
when he thought you were going to take him for a walk?

376
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,560
That's why Arthur came to think

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,660
that humans cannot go outside unless they wear shoes.

378
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,260
He tried to hide your shoes

379
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,960
so that you wouldn't be able to go home with Christie

380
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,960
who he really likes.

381
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,860
Is that right?

382
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,860
But don't worry, Arthur.

383
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,360
Christie and I have also ended up

384
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,160
having to go to London just like your master.

385
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,960
Huh? Which means...

386
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,460
Yes.

387
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,960
That is what I came to tell you today.

388
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Which means that you're going to get married after all?

389
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,860
This calls for a celebration.

390
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Congratulations, both of you!

391
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,760
Congratulations!

392
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,060
We've got to have a celebratory party before the move, then.

393
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,860
Silly dog.

394
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,360
Don't worry, nobody's angry at you anymore.

395
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,460
All right!

396
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,960
We were all worried about you.

397
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,660
Because you looked to be so blue recently.

398
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,860
That's why we were trying to think up a plan to cheer you up.

399
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,260
So, I'm not counted in?

400
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,160
Because you're always arguing with Haibara.

401
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,460
That's right.

402
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,360
Oh, I see.

403
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,460
-You did it, Arthur! -Good work!

404
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
Good work!

405
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,260
Right, you should always keep smiling Iike that.

406
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,460
Huh?

407
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,360
As long as you're wearing that facial expression,

408
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,060
you look nothing but a child.

409
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,660
That way, you'll look far from an old lady approaching her 90s.

410
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,960
It's a joke!

411
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,260
How rude!

412
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
I'm only 84.

413
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,500
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,480
"Cracked wine"
