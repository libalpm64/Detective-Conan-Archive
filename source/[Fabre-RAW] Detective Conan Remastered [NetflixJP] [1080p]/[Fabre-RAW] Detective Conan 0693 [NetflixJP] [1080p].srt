1
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:04,939
The employees of a company called New Image

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,739
are attacked one after the other and are seriously injured.

3
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:11,739
And the president of New Image receives a threatening call.

4
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:14,839
Furthermore, Mr. Mouri was appointed by the culprit

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,039
to make the delivery.

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,339
M is going south down Chuo Boulevard.

7
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,739
The cruiser that M is on board sailed under Minato Bridge just now.

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,639
The culprit's planning to get the money somewhere along the river.

9
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,039
Keep your eyes open.

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,039
Roger.

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,039
The waves of the transceiver

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,739
works only in a range of at most, 100 meters.

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,139
The culprit should be somewhere in this range.

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,839
It's about time you start working for me.

15
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:52,939
That cruiser is headed for Oojima water gate

16
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,739
and will be going into Ooyoko River.

17
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:59,239
Then, put the briefcase on the roof of the cruiser.

18
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,639
Put it in the center so that it doesn't fall.

19
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:04,539
Then, go back to your seat and wait for the next contact.

20
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:17,906
That brat...

21
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:22,906
M has entered Heikyu River.

22
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:25,806
The briefcase is on the roof of the cruiser.

23
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:40,506
The briefcase is gone!

24
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:44,106
The criminal used an attache case with an electromagnet stashed inside.

25
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:45,606
They used this technique

26
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,706
so the case would stick to the frame of the bridge

27
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:51,306
and the could artfully get away with the 24,000,000 yen.

28
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:53,206
We thought it was suspicious

29
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:55,306
that the culprit designated pops as the courier,

30
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:58,306
so we investigated and the one man emerged.

31
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:03,406
Satoshi Nishizawa, he was New Image's mechanical engineer.

32
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:04,806
We found out through pop's investigation

33
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:07,506
that he had been guilty of stalking.

34
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,906
So, New Images had fired him.

35
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:15,906
Mr. Nishizawa. Are you in?

36
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,506
Mr. Nishizawa!

37
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,006
It seems he's not in.

38
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,106
Yes.

39
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:27,506
It's open.

40
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:33,606
Mr. Nishizawa, aren't you home?

41
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,406
Mr. Nishizawa!

42
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,206
Conan.

43
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,306
No, Conan.

44
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,606
You shouldn't go into other people's houses without permission.

45
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,806
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

46
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,806
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

47
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:08,806
The culprit dies so the case is closed?

48
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,906
Where is the ransom and where is the case headed to?

49
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:12,606
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,506
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,706
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,239
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 2)"

53
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:08,839
Mr. Nishizawa.

54
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,339
Wait, Ran.

55
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,039
Look.

56
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,539
Although the water is up to the brim of the bath tub,

57
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,839
there's no water splashed around anywhere.

58
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,139
It probably dried up.

59
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,039
This means that Mr. Nishzawa sunk in the water quite a while ago.

60
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,139
I think it's been more than 6 hours already.

61
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,639
Oh, no.

62
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,539
At any rate Ran, contact the police.

63
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:34,539
Okay.

64
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,539
An empty pill bottle Sleeping pills.

65
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,239
A flower petal?

66
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,939
I wonder what flower the petal is from?

67
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,039
It s shape is like that of a cherry blossom, but the color...

68
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,039
Hey, Ran. What're you doing over here?

69
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,339
Officer Sato!

70
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,239
Mr. Nishizawa in the bath tub is...

71
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,839
What?

72
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,039
-Mr. Nishizawa. -He's dead already.

73
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,339
Conan?

74
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,539
Officer Takagi, contact HQ!

75
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,239
Yes, ma'am!

76
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,839
Officer Sato.

77
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,339
What brings you here?

78
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,839
A stolen motorboat was found on Heikyu River,

79
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,739
and Satoshi Nishizawa's fingerprints were found there.

80
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,939
So, now that you know,

81
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,139
leave the rest to us and out you go, out.

82
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,139
Okay.

83
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,739
Then, let's go out so that,

84
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,839
we don't get in their way, Conan.

85
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,839
Hey.

86
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,739
Conan, no!

87
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,939
This is?

88
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,939
"Mouri Detective Agency"

89
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:57,139
Nishizawa committed suicide.

90
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,939
The boat that he seems to have used to commit the crime was found

91
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:02,639
and his fingerprints were detected on it.

92
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,539
Besides, here's the will that was found inside his computer.

93
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,239
The estimated time of his death is around 01:00 am.

94
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,239
He drowned after over dosing himself with sleeping pills.

95
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:18,839
There's probably no mistake that it's suicide.

96
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,339
I didn't commit this crime because I wanted money.

97
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,539
Kogoro Mouri, you had the nerve to hand me over to the police

98
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,539
saying that pure feeling of love was nothing but stalking.

99
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,539
Moreover, President Ishida fired me.

100
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,839
I'll put you to shame, world renown detective

101
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,539
and President Ishida, who couldn't save an employee of yours.

102
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,639
My purpose this time is to punish both you and the president socially.

103
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,139
I no longer intend to live on in shame.

104
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,939
I don't have any reason to go on living anymore.

105
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,739
Well, although we can't conclude anything

106
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,639
before we do a thorough check yet, but...

107
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,639
for now, we'll have to report on the progress we're making.

108
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,639
Inspector.

109
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,639
Was the money that was stolen found?

110
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,339
No, not yet.

111
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,639
I see.

112
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,039
See you then, Mouri.

113
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,439
It hasn't finished yet.

114
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,939
The money hasn't come out yet,

115
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,539
so how can the case be closed!

116
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,939
The case is just starting to be solved!

117
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:31,339
I don't anything about Mr. Nishizawa.

118
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,039
I heard that you both got along well.

119
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,639
Tell me what you know.

120
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,539
"Kaoru Tanaka" -Even if it may not be something too convenient for you?

121
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,939
Yeah, go ahead.

122
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,239
Let's hear it.

123
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,239
Mr. Nishizawa hated you.

124
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,239
Yeah. It seems so...

125
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,539
And, did you hear about his plans as to this case?

126
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,539
No, nothing.

127
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,439
I see.

128
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:59,439
By the way...

129
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,039
What about your alibi at about 01:00 am?

130
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,939
Mine?

131
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,339
Why do I need an alibi?

132
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:07,639
He committed suicide, didn't he?

133
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,439
We don't know for sure yet.

134
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,339
Well, if we check on President Ishida's acquaintances,

135
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,039
we'll eventually come up with an answer, though.

136
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,739
Then, stop suspecting me and suspect the president.

137
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:25,339
Mr. Nishizawa was blackmailing President Ishida.

138
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,939
Are you blackmailing me?

139
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,239
Are presidents supposed to protect their employees?

140
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,939
You lowered the image of the company

141
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,339
and yet the nerve of you.

142
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,839
If you fired me, pay me compensation.

143
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,539
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,839
I'll disclose your accounting fraud!

145
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,939
I could care less if this company goes bankrupt!

146
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:53,939
Cool it, let's talk it over.

147
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,139
I think the president has a motive to kill Mr. Nishizawa.

148
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,539
I'm asking for your alibi.

149
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,139
If at around 01:00 am,

150
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,339
I was at home, on the phone with my girlfriend.

151
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,739
Your cell phone won't serve as an alibi.

152
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,239
It was my house phone.

153
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:14,739
If you suspect me why don't you check on my call history or whatever.

154
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,139
You don't need to check it.

155
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,739
It's suicide, isn't it?

156
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:22,439
Don't you want to get back your 24,000,000 yen?

157
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,439
"Gen Ishida (42)" -I don't want such petty money.

158
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,739
I can get that much profit by selling a car anytime.

159
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,339
Good work, just forget it, already.

160
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:34,039
No matter if Nishizawa designated you,

161
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,839
I can see it wasn't an easy job.

162
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,539
So, keep it.

163
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,939
What's your alibi at 01:00 am?

164
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,039
Me? I was sleeping.

165
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,239
I'm single so I've got nobody to verify it though.

166
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,539
Sorry to have intruded on you.

167
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,639
Aren't you taking it?

168
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,339
Why don't you use it for Nishizawa's funeral?

169
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,539
Why don't you suspect Tanaka who was Nishizawa's subordinate?

170
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,039
He was hanging around with Nishizawa

171
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,139
and loved to gamble.

172
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,939
He has quite a large sum of debts.

173
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,439
He came to me once, but it wasn't an amount

174
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,239
that he could return even if I were to give him advance payment,

175
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,639
so I turned him down.

176
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:17,739
A surveillance camera.

177
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,439
That was close.

178
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,539
Come to think of it,

179
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,839
there was no surveillance camera on that road!

180
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,439
There's no surveillance camera here either.

181
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,439
It's not cool to go straight.

182
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,139
It's Toyosu Canal.

183
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,539
Taking the route that I just came,

184
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,639
since there are no surveillance cameras images

185
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,539
to serve as evidence won't remain.

186
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,039
If he left the boat here

187
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,939
and went out to Ooyoko River

188
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,239
and retrieved the briefcase.

189
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:10,639
Gramps!

190
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,939
If you take this side route,

191
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,839
it leads to the direction of Sendai Bori River.

192
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,539
Lower your head.

193
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,539
It's narrow, but a motorboat could probably make it in here, right?

194
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,539
Yeah.

195
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:45,039
Cherry blossoms in full bloom are beautiful, aren't they?

196
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,039
Yes.

197
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,739
Stop over there.

198
00:12:57,739 --> 00:12:58,739
What?

199
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,039
It's Mr. Nishizawa's apartment after all.

200
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:11,039
But, no yellow flower looks to be in sight.

201
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,039
Did you find something?

202
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,339
No.

203
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,039
Hey, do you know any yellow flowers

204
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,839
that have petals that look like cherry blossoms?

205
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,339
Yeah, there's something called the Ukon Sakura.

206
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,139
Ukon Sakura?

207
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,139
You can find them only in Tsukuda in this area.

208
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,139
They normally bloom later than the Somei Yoshino.

209
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,539
This year however, they're already in bloom.

210
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,739
I'd like to see that!

211
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:36,439
What? You've figured out the real culprit!

212
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,939
I have someone in mind, Inspector Megure.

213
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,139
You mean Nishizawa didn't do it and he didn't commit suicide?

214
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,739
That's right.

215
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,839
Who's the real culprit?

216
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,539
I'll leave you in suspense.

217
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,639
Please tell the President of New Image Mr. Ishida,

218
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,339
and engineer Mr. Tanaka

219
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,539
to come to the president's room of New Image at 05:00 pm today.

220
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:58,039
Okay, but...

221
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,239
I hope you know what you're doing, Mouri.

222
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,339
Please trust, Kogoro Mouri here.

223
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,939
Dad.

224
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:12,339
I told you not to carry yourself too far.

225
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,739
Stay in bed like you should be.

226
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:17,939
I understand! I'll head there immediately!

227
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,439
Inspector. There seems to be a large amount of 10,000 yen bills

228
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:22,939
floating in the Tsukuda area of Sumida River.

229
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,939
It's yesterday's money, isn't it?

230
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,039
An empty briefcase seems to have been found,

231
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,339
so I guess the contents flowed out.

232
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,539
Strange.

233
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,839
The place where the empty briefcase was found is here.

234
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,239
And this is where I am now.

235
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:49,939
Why isn't there any money flowing in the rivers along the way?

236
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:03,026
Not with this fever, dad.

237
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:07,826
I've got to put on the world renown detective,

238
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:09,626
Kogoro Mouri's deduction show from 05:00 pm.

239
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:12,026
I can't be stuck in bed because of a cold.

240
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,626
Geez.

241
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:14,826
What's the matter?

242
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:17,026
Stop him, Conan.

243
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:20,226
Dad insists on doing his deduction show and won't listen to me.

244
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:21,826
Have you figured out the culprit?

245
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,426
I'll leave you in suspense till 05:00 pm.

246
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:25,426
Come to think of it,

247
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,926
some of the money that was taken was found in Sumida River.

248
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,526
What?

249
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,726
It seems that the money was disposed of.

250
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,426
This man.

251
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:37,926
Oh, no.

252
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:41,426
If the money is found, my deduction won't do.

253
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,726
I think my fever's suddenly risen.

254
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,326
That's why I've been telling you not to go.

255
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:50,826
Would you like me to go in place of you?

256
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,526
You have a video camera, don't you?

257
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:53,526
Yes.

258
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:56,126
All we have to do, is film your deduction

259
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:58,026
and show it to everybody.

260
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,626
Since Pops Kogoro can't make it because of a cold,

261
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,726
I was told to show you this recorded video film.

262
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:08,126
Never mind the formalities and just get on with it.

263
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,626
I'm busy.

264
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:10,726
Okay!

265
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:16,326
People refer to me as the renown detective.

266
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:18,226
Yes, I am...

267
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:23,526
Kogoro Mouri.

268
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,726
There are two keys to solving the case this time.

269
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,926
First, a grudge against New Image.

270
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:34,126
And, second, someone who has a grudge against me, Kogoro Mouri.

271
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,526
"Rather, the culprit utalized these two key issues"

272
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:40,726
There are three suspects.

273
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:44,526
Mr. Satoshi Nishizawa, who died after leaving a will behind.

274
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:47,126
His subordinate, Atsushi Tanaka,

275
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:51,326
and the president of New Image, Mr. Gen Nishida.

276
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:52,926
Mr. Satoshi Nishizawa had a grudge

277
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:57,426
against the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri and President Ishida.

278
00:16:57,426 --> 00:17:01,826
Moreover, he was blackmailing President Ishida.

279
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:03,326
Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,126
I was being blackmail by Nishizawa you say?

281
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,526
Show me the evidence!

282
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,826
As for you, President Ishida,

283
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,126
you have no alibi at the time the money taken at Ooyoko River

284
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:15,726
and moreover, during the estimate time of death of Mr. Nishizawa.

285
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:19,426
If Mr. Nishizawa were to have been killed, that is...

286
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:23,526
That doesn't make me the culprit, does it?

287
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,126
But in the case of Mr. Tanaka,

288
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,226
there is nothing that leads to him having a grudge

289
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:30,626
against New Image or to kill Mr. Nishizawa.

290
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:35,626
Besides, he has an alibi during the time Mr. Nishizawa was found dead.

291
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,626
I'm glad you found out.

292
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:42,926
Only, you like gambling and had a great sum of debt.

293
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:44,326
If taken from that point of view,

294
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:47,926
you have a motive to commit the crime,

295
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:50,126
but Mr. Tanaka is clear after all.

296
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:52,626
"That may not be certain!"

297
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,126
Why?

298
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:58,426
Taking into consideration that will that was left behind

299
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,326
in Mr. Nishizawa's room,

300
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:03,226
setting the electromagnet onto the briefcase,

301
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,426
stealing the motorboat that was docked,

302
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:09,226
stealing the money at Ooyoko River,

303
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,926
then disposing the money and briefcase into the river,

304
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:15,026
return to his apartment and drink the sleeping pills,

305
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:17,326
and finally sink himself in the bath tub.

306
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:20,026
In other words, Mr. Nishizawa committed suicide...

307
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:25,326
"This would've happened, but, in fast, he was murdered!"

308
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:28,626
Just what is Detective Mouri trying to get at?

309
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,626
"The real culprit is you!"

310
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:35,726
From here, I will read Detective Mouri's deduction from here.

311
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:37,626
Will you be all right, Conan?

312
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,726
Yes.

313
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,626
According to Detective Mouri,

314
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,826
the real culprit is...

315
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,426
you, Mr. Tanaka!

316
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,426
What?

317
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,026
Just what're you talking about?

318
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:54,126
I've got an alibi, don't I?

319
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:56,526
But you seem to be great debt

320
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,526
of about 20,000,000 yen with a financial institution.

321
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:03,026
You committed this crime in order to repay that money.

322
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,526
More than the motive,

323
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,926
how are you going to explain my alibi?

324
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,626
I'll explain things in chronological order.

325
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:13,326
Mr. Tanaka who stole the money, didn't dispose of the money

326
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,926
but after disposing of only the empty briefcase and electromagnet,

327
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:21,326
used the waterway and went to Mr. Nishizawa's apartment.

328
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,626
Then after passing Mr. Nishzawa out

329
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:29,326
carried him onto the boat and went back to your own condo.

330
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:31,326
Your condo is in Tsukuda,

331
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:34,226
so you can move from place to place using the waterway.

332
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:39,026
You made Mr. Nishizawa drink an over dose of sleeping pills

333
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:43,226
to make it look like a suicide, and made preparations to kill him.

334
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:47,126
At the same time that you called your girlfriend from your house phone,

335
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:50,726
you poured hot water into the bath tub where Mr. Nishizawa was sleeping.

336
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,126
I was doubtful

337
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:59,926
because the time you were talking to your girlfriend on the phone

338
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:02,826
matched the estimate time of death of Mr. Nishizawa.

339
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,726
So much so, that it seemed to be an alibi creating scheme.

340
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:10,526
And then, you made a great mistake.

341
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:14,526
You didn't notice that the petal of an Ukon Sakura

342
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:18,026
that is in bloom near your condo got stuck on Mr. Nishizawa's clothes.

343
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:22,326
After making an alibi for yourself by phoning your girlfriend,

344
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,226
you used the waterway again

345
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:27,226
and returned to Mr. Nishizawa's apartment on your boat

346
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,826
and put the dead body into the bath tub.

347
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:33,326
In other words, you changed not the time of death,

348
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:34,626
but rather the place.

349
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:43,726
But, you didn't realize the petal of the Ukon Sakura at all.

350
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:46,126
You had a debt of 20,000,000 yen.

351
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,726
At first you were planning

352
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,326
to take the entire amount of 24,000,000 yen but...

353
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:51,726
To make it look as if this crime was committed

354
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:53,226
because of a grudge and not for money,

355
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:55,226
since you left a will behind in the computer,

356
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,726
you had no choice but to dispose of the 4,000,000 yen

357
00:20:57,726 --> 00:21:02,126
after paying of your debt, so you threw it into the river

358
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,626
to substantiate Mr. Nishizawa's will.

359
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:08,126
Is that correct, Mr. Tanaka?

360
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,426
It's all just a bunch of baloney!

361
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:10,926
It's all just made up!

362
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:14,926
I saw you riding a motorbike at Ooyoko River.

363
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,226
That was close.

364
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:23,226
Before and after the money was taken...

365
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:26,426
I had a close call with the motorbike.

366
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:32,226
It was the same number plate as this.

367
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,226
It's your motorbike, isn't it?

368
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,826
It was parked in this parking lot.

369
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:41,026
You used the road without surveillance cameras to your advantage,

370
00:21:41,026 --> 00:21:42,926
but I saw you.

371
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,826
Darn! How dare you feign looking like a good guy

372
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,626
and still murder somebody?

373
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:58,926
Mr. Ishida.

374
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:03,726
I will report your accounting fraud to the second division.

375
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:06,226
I advise that you be ready for it.

376
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:09,026
I'm sure the tax office will get to you too.

377
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:11,426
That's quite a problem.

378
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:13,726
Can't something be done about it, officer?

379
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:15,126
Of course not!

380
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:42,226
Well, just as expected of Mouri.

381
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:43,626
Will you tell him that he did a great job

382
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:47,026
despite being under the weather, Conan?

383
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,126
Okay!

384
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:53,226
I edited everything in this.

385
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,760
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,960
"Japanese sweet box".
