1
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:11,991
This pot is my pride and joy!

2
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,629
Will some appraise it for me?

3
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,997
So, he's Doctor Agasa.

4
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,629
If all cases were men,

5
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,529
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

6
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,045
Doc's house is the target?

7
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,829
Ayumi's disappearance and shadows of the Organization.

8
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,429
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,329
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,053
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:44,143
"Doc's Video Site (Part 1)"

12
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:50,149
The curry looks delicious!

13
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,151
Yep. With this much,

14
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,823
it won't matter how many helpings Genta comes back for.

15
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,623
True.

16
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,823
All we have left to do now is to put the lid on

17
00:02:57,823 --> 00:02:59,523
and keep it simmering for a while.

18
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:03,823
Let's see, I guess I'll try tasting it before that.

19
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:05,523
Ouch.

20
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:09,523
Nobody that brings rice on his plate is going to get to taste this.

21
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,923
Stingy...

22
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,223
Wait just a little while more, okay, Doc?

23
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,923
I guess I have no choice.

24
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:18,177
By the way, did you figure it out, Conan,

25
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,179
the value of that pot?

26
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:23,623
No. I only know that it seems to be really old,

27
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:24,823
but I haven't figured out what era it's from

28
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:27,123
or who made it yet.

29
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,189
Well, I'll find out by the time Genta

30
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,623
and Mitsuhiko get back.

31
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:34,193
"We're having curry today"

32
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,195
"Curry from afternoon"

33
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:39,323
"We'll have curry in the evening too while we're at it"

34
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,823
Genta.

35
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:43,923
-Huh? -I know it's Doc's wallet,

36
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,823
but don't you think you bought too much?

37
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:48,207
All he asked us to get were drinks.

38
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:50,209
Who cares! It's good to have a lot of Yaiba chocolates

39
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:52,623
and Yaiba snacks, right?

40
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:55,723
Conan asked me to get him a soccer magazine too, besides.

41
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:58,223
I bought yogurt, your favorite for you too, Mitsuhiko.

42
00:03:58,223 --> 00:03:59,423
Thank you.

43
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,123
Oh, it's you guys!

44
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:03,723
Are you acquainted

45
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,023
with Doctor Agasa who lives here?

46
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:07,823
Yes.

47
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,923
You were with Ran the other day.

48
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,423
So, you're a girl after all.

49
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:16,235
Yeah. My name's Masumi Sera.

50
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,723
But, you don't have boobs, so it's kind of...

51
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:21,723
True.

52
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:25,523
They're supposed to be popping out anytime soon.

53
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:29,823
That's right, thank you last time.

54
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,523
You two helped during that hole up case, right?

55
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,323
I was one of the hostages too, you see.

56
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:38,623
Is that right?

57
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,623
Well, it's thanks to us, Youth Detective Squad

58
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,923
investigating and all I guess!

59
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:45,823
And Shinichi Kudo too!

60
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:50,023
Yeah. Doc said, that a high school detective

61
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,123
that happened to be his acquaintance

62
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:54,273
coincidentally came along and solved the case!

63
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:59,223
But we were told by Haibara to keep this a secret.

64
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,723
Haibara?

65
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:03,723
Are you talking about the quiet looking girl

66
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,285
with short hair that's living with Doc?

67
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,287
Yeah... She's not that quiet, though.

68
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:10,289
Have you ever met her?

69
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,291
No. I just got a glimpse of her

70
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:16,295
on the video website together with Doc.

71
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,297
He was boasting that when he cleaned out his storeroom,

72
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,523
he found an expensive looking pot!

73
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,923
He wants somebody to appraise it.

74
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:28,307
But, why do you have to keep the thing about Kudo a secret?

75
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,323
The house next door is his house, isn't it?

76
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:32,311
Beats me.

77
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,313
That house is always vacant,

78
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,023
but that day it seems he went back to pick up something he forgot,

79
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:39,623
and while he was at it, he stopped over at Doc's place.

80
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:42,323
Maybe somebody's still there?

81
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:44,623
I saw the curtains flutter just a while ago.

82
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,023
Oh, that's probably...

83
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,623
Subaru!

84
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,223
Subaru?

85
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,223
His apartment was burned in a fire,

86
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:53,623
so it seems he's living there now.

87
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:58,723
I thought that somebody was living there without permission.

88
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,323
But, I guess I was just worrying for nothing.

89
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,423
It smells good!

90
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,123
Can we start eating already?

91
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,823
-Not yet. -Wait about another half an hour.

92
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,923
What? You mean we have to wait 30 more minutes?

93
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,423
Is it really going to take that long.

94
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:28,023
But, there's a little that we can taste before, the whole works.

95
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:30,923
Hors d'oeuvre? You mean appetizer?

96
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,123
Right, right! So, we get to eat curry

97
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:36,375
as an hors d'oeuvre and also a big serving as the main dish?

98
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,023
No way!

99
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,923
Genta, you and Doc are too gluttonous!

100
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:46,385
I can't stand it anymore, unless I keep myself busy!

101
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,423
What're you doing, Conan?

102
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:53,623
I'm checking the pot that Doc got out of the store room,

103
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:57,023
but I think it's best to have it appraised by an appraiser.

104
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,023
Oh, you mean the stuff

105
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,423
that Doc was boasting about on his video site?

106
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:03,323
Hey, Doc! You really don't remember?

107
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,623
Who you bought the pot from?

108
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:10,409
No. I remember I bought it at a flea market some years ago, though.

109
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,823
Together with that carpet that you're sitting on right now.

110
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:15,623
You mean with this old worn out carpet?

111
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:18,023
Yeah, I laid it out because it came out

112
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:19,823
together from the storeroom with the pot.

113
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,623
Hey, Genta!

114
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:26,223
Don't go kicking the soccer ball in the room!

115
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:28,023
I can't help it, can I? I'm so hungry.

116
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:31,023
I feel like I'm going to die.

117
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:53,623
Yes. I'm sorry.

118
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,523
One more time, from the bottom of your heart!

119
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:59,123
Yes. I'm seriously very sorry.

120
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:01,523
Well... it's okay already.

121
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,123
It's not okay! We've got to go

122
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:07,323
buy the ingredients for remaking the curry, you know!

123
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:09,923
So, I already told you that we'd go out to buy the groceries,

124
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,123
so you stay back home.

125
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:14,473
I can't afford to let you guys go

126
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,323
because you'll buy unnecessary stuff again!

127
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,477
Yes...

128
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,479
Okay then, I'll go get the meat at the shop

129
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,123
where they're having a sale!

130
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:24,923
Let's meet later at the supermarket then!

131
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,487
Haibara.

132
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,923
I think it's about time you forgive him.

133
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:33,723
You're scarier than my mom.

134
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:34,823
Listen...

135
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:37,423
You're not getting a second helping of curry, Genta.

136
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:40,023
What? No way.

137
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,823
Come on, pretty please...

138
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,503
-No. -Miser.

139
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:07,923
Ayumi, I put your clothes in the basket!

140
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,423
Thank you!

141
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:27,323
It's Ai's clothes!

142
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:29,323
It smells of Ai.

143
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:34,023
Doc! I finished taking a bath!

144
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:40,559
What?

145
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:44,223
Haibara was shown on the video site?

146
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,823
Are you serious?

147
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:48,923
Yes. Haibara appeared on the video site

148
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,123
that Doc was boasting his pot about a while ago.

149
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,523
Masumi said so.

150
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:56,323
Masumi?

151
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:58,223
Where'd you see her?

152
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,123
In front of Doc's house.

153
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,581
When we came back after buying the drinks.

154
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,583
But, it's strange.

155
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,523
I wasn't supposed to be on the video site.

156
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,323
Then, confirm that with Doc.

157
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:14,593
-I'm doing so now. -But, what it is?

158
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,923
It's not connecting.

159
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:19,223
Hey, Conan!

160
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:22,123
Don't tell me that...

161
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,323
Don't tell me that...

162
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:42,923
Doc!

163
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,623
Ayumi!

164
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,823
Are you all right?

165
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:52,023
Hey, Doc.

166
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:54,023
Hey? Get a hold of yourself!

167
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:00,223
Doc! Are you all right? What happened?

168
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,023
The doorbell rang, so I went to answer it

169
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:06,645
and I was suddenly shot with a stun gun.

170
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,023
A stun gun?

171
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,223
Maybe they came after

172
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:12,651
the pot Doc were boasting about?

173
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,523
No, the pot is right here.

174
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
The coffee that is spilled on the floor.

175
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,723
Moreover, there's a trace of something having been here.

176
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,223
Hey...

177
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,323
Ayumi's nowhere!

178
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,223
What?

179
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:37,223
The old carpet's gone too.

180
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:39,123
Since coffee was also spilled

181
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:42,323
on the floor where it was laid out.

182
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:45,323
It means that when Ayumi was attacked,

183
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,223
she was pushed down to the floor where the spilt coffee was

184
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,123
and rendered immobile.

185
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:50,223
Then it is most likely

186
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,423
that she was wrapped in the carpet and carried away.

187
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,693
Why in the carpet?

188
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:56,695
Because instead of putting her in a big bag,

189
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,323
it would look like some movers or renovators

190
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:03,423
have come to carry the carpet away,

191
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,623
thus avoiding needless suspicion.

192
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:07,123
Then, was she kidnapped?

193
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:09,323
But, why would they take Ayumi?

194
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:12,323
I mean she only happened to be here, after all.

195
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:15,823
Hey, Doc! You can get the video

196
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:17,323
that you uploaded on the site right away, can't you?

197
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,023
Yeah.

198
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,523
This pot is my pride and joy!

199
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:24,023
I'd like someone to appraise it for me!

200
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,323
Only Doc is on.

201
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,723
No, wait.

202
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,923
Something's on your glasses, Doc.

203
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,523
Maybe they were

204
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:45,323
after you, Haibara.

205
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,718
Then, is this the story?

206
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,918
The culprit mistakenly thought

207
00:12:57,918 --> 00:12:59,818
that Ayumi was Ai and kidnapped her?

208
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:02,761
Yeah. It's very likely.

209
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,518
It's more natural to think that the culprit saw the video

210
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,018
that was aired on the video site

211
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:11,218
and learned that I was here in this house and took her away.

212
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:12,318
They probably came here

213
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:16,518
after seeing that we left to go shopping,

214
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:18,777
shocked you with the stun gun,

215
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,918
wrapped Ayumi who was here in the carpet and took her away.

216
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:24,783
Then, you mean the culprit was watching this house?

217
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,618
-Yeah. -But, if they were watching us,

218
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:31,318
they should've seen Haibara go out with us, right?

219
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:33,518
Haibara was wearing a cap back then

220
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,518
and her hair was rolled inside it, right?

221
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:38,118
It's not surprising that the culprit overlooked her.

222
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:42,118
Besides, the change that I put out for Ayumi

223
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:46,318
were the same clothes that Ai was wearing in the video.

224
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:48,018
If she had her head covered with the hood,

225
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:50,809
they would think that she was Haibara.

226
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,218
It... it's my fault.

227
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:55,318
If I didn't play soccer in the room,

228
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:57,818
we wouldn't have had to go shopping.

229
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,318
It's not your fault.

230
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,218
I'm to blame.

231
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,418
This is what my abominable circumstances

232
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,418
brought about...

233
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,831
No, wrong.

234
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
It's not your fault.

235
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,418
If it were those guys, they wouldn't mistake Ayumi for you.

236
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:19,418
But...

237
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:22,618
Besides, think about it... this situation.

238
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:27,118
I'm checking your image using Doc's PC now.

239
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:29,518
If this is the doing of the men in black,

240
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:34,118
they would've killed Doc and ambushed you.

241
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,855
The data in this PC would've been deleted first thing,

242
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,518
the house would've been burned down

243
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:41,518
and all traces of you having been would've been totally erased.

244
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,118
But, what if this is a trap?

245
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,218
Since I, their target wasn't here,

246
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,867
they pretended being kidnappers, took Ayumi away

247
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,871
and are trying to lure a flustered me out, then what?

248
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,418
Maybe they kidnapped her to find out

249
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:58,618
how much she knows about me.

250
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,018
If that's what they wanted to do,

251
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:02,618
they would've kidnapped Doc.

252
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:05,918
They would never go through the risk of kidnapping somebody.

253
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:08,018
They would investigate secretly,

254
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:10,118
scheme a plan and before you know

255
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,118
it everything is erased. That's how they do things, right?

256
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:15,918
Hey, you guys! What're you guys whispering about anyway?

257
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:16,918
It's nothing.

258
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,518
Can't we pursue the whereabouts of Ayumi

259
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,218
using your glasses, Conan?

260
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:24,903
Because Ayumi always carries her transmitter detective badge with her.

261
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:28,018
No. I checked on that a while ago,

262
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,318
but the badge is in this house.

263
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:32,418
She probably left it in the clothes

264
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,718
that she was wearing before she changed clothes.

265
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,918
At any rate, let's call the police.

266
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,318
What's that sound?

267
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:43,418
The ringtone of a cell phone?

268
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,518
It's coming from that pot!

269
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:51,518
It's Ayumi's cell phone!

270
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,718
"Read the mail and follow orders!"

271
00:15:57,318 --> 00:15:59,318
One mail's come in.

272
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:00,939
It's Doc's address.

273
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,318
Don't tell me that...

274
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,718
My cell phone was stolen.

275
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:08,118
What orders are they talking about?

276
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:11,718
Find this cat. It should be around there.

277
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:14,218
Mail this cell phone when you find it.

278
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:16,955
We'll release the girl in exchange for the cat.

279
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,718
Of course if you contact the police, the girl dies.

280
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,818
What does it mean?

281
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:25,718
Was Ayumi kidnapped because of that gray cat?

282
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,965
I guess so.

283
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,918
At any rate, we've got to find that cat fast

284
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:32,971
or else I guess it's certain that Ayumi is in danger.

285
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,518
Okay! I'll forward the image of this cat to all of you,

286
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:37,618
so let's split up and search for it!

287
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,318
Aye...

288
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,718
Darn, it's nowhere!

289
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,618
Any call from the culprits?

290
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,045
Not yet.

291
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:50,718
We can't judge the size of the cat from this image,

292
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:53,618
so I mailed them several times to ask them.

293
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,718
I wonder why they're not answering.

294
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:58,418
Don't tell me that they gave up looking for the cat

295
00:17:58,418 --> 00:17:59,918
and already took Ayumi's...

296
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:02,418
Idiot! What makes you think that guys who would kidnap a child

297
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:06,518
in order to look for their cat, give up that easily?

298
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:10,018
It's your mail address, Doc.

299
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:13,071
-It's from the culprits. -What does it say?

300
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,518
No joke! Is that for real?

301
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,077
Yeah! You guys are searching

302
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,618
near the apartment complex on 3 chome, right?

303
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,081
Yes.

304
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,918
This is what's written in the culprit's mail.

305
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,418
The cat's been found. We will release the girl

306
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:32,218
in the trash dump at the apartment complex on 3 chome.

307
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,918
Ayumi...

308
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,318
She's nowhere.

309
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,518
Don't tell me that...

310
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:58,618
-Ayumi! -Ayumi...

311
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,518
You're fine now.

312
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:18,518
But, I'm sure glad

313
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:21,139
that Ayumi came back safely.

314
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:23,141
She doesn't seem to be hurt anywhere too.

315
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:24,718
I'm fine!

316
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:29,147
My cell phone was wrapped in the carpet together with Ayumi,

317
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,218
and although the back of the carpet got a bit dirty,

318
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:34,418
it came back with no stains too.

319
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,418
But, how ruthless.

320
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,318
Yes. They ask us to search for their cat,

321
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:39,618
but after they find it,

322
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:43,918
they dispose of Ayumi together with the trash.

323
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:46,718
They said it was an important cat or something.

324
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,167
Huh? Did you hear the culprit's voice?

325
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,169
Yep. It was a high pitched, nauseating,

326
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:53,171
strange voice, though.

327
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,118
They used helium gas to change their voices, right?

328
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:59,177
And? Did the culprits say something else?

329
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,918
Well, they seemed really rushed.

330
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:04,218
They were saying that it was their master's cat

331
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:06,318
so they would be in trouble if they didn't find it.

332
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:09,187
Could it have been the cat of some super rich person?

333
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,189
Beats me.

334
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,718
It seems that the cat got away near here,

335
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,918
and they mistakenly thought that Doc had picked it up

336
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,918
and was feeding it.

337
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:19,197
He was shouting saying that if Doc had the cat,

338
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:21,718
the cat toilet, the water and feeding bowls

339
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:23,201
should be somewhere so to find it.

340
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,318
You mean the culprit wasn't alone?

341
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:28,418
Yeah. There seems to have been two.

342
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:30,018
They both had strange voices

343
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:33,211
and were wearing a cap with holes for their eyes and mouth.

344
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,818
You mean a twosome wearing mask caps?

345
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,618
Super bad guys!

346
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:40,718
But, they let me out of the carpet once,

347
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,618
and let me drink water.

348
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,818
Even after they wrapped me back into the carpet,

349
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,818
they asked me if I could breathe okay.

350
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:50,118
Moreover, they said they wrapped me in the carpet

351
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:54,418
because all they had on them was a cat carry bag.

352
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:58,818
In other words, the cat keeper of some rich person,

353
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:01,239
carelessly makes the cat get away and panics.

354
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,241
Then, wanting to get the cat back,

355
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,018
he commits a kidnapping case.

356
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,718
But, it ends up being a stupid story

357
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:09,518
where the keeper eventually finds the cat on his own.

358
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,018
But... If so, they should've honestly said,

359
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,318
"It's our master's cat, so if you picked it up,

360
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,318
please give it back to us".

361
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,518
I wonder about that.

362
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:20,018
If the owner of the cat is found to be rich,

363
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:22,018
an exorbitant reward may be demanded,

364
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:24,018
and this way, the fact that they let the cat flee would be

365
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,263
revealed to their master, right?

366
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:28,718
No, I don't think it's such a simple case.

367
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,269
No matter if they saw us leave to go shopping,

368
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,618
unless they already knew that Doc

369
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:35,273
and Ayumi were the only ones in the house,

370
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,275
I don't think they could do something like break into a house

371
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,277
with just a stun gun.

372
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:42,218
Besides, it didn't even take us 30 minutes to go

373
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,318
and come back from shopping.

374
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:46,018
If it was a house that they broke into for the first time,

375
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:49,287
do you think they could've passed Doc out with the stun gun,

376
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,918
confirm that the cat was nowhere inside,

377
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:56,718
then wrap Ayumi in the carpet and carry her out?

378
00:21:56,718 --> 00:22:00,418
Moreover, they even found Doc's and Ayumi's cell phone too.

379
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,618
Then, don't tell me that the culprits...

380
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:05,318
Yeah. They knew

381
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:09,307
that you and Doc live in this house, just the two of you.

382
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,918
That all four of us come over here to play,

383
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:16,418
and that all of us own cell phones too.

384
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,818
But how did they get that information?

385
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:22,418
Has anybody you don't know come over to this house recently?

386
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,318
Come to think of it, yes.

387
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:27,325
-About three pairs. -Three pairs?

388
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:33,331
See, the ones who saw the video site that you just saw came.

389
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:34,618
The culprit is probably among

390
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:37,335
the three pairs of people who came.

391
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,918
I'll find them for sure.

392
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,220
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,242
"Ear"

394
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:09,427
Make sure to tune in next time too.

395
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,040
You don't have get all hung up on ear, Doc.
