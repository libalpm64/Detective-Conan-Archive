1
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:07,622
Let's call it a day!

2
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:10,822
This case was closed faster than expected, wasn't it?

3
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:14,822
Yeah, thanks to Officer Takagi staking out stubbornly, I guess.

4
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:17,922
I would prefer you using the adjective persistent.

5
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:19,722
-Here. -Hot!

6
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:24,322
-Reward! -Thanks.

7
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:25,722
Here.

8
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:28,522
Officer Shiratori, good work, too.

9
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:37,422
Huh? You don't like canned coffee?

10
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:39,022
It's not that.

11
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:41,522
-Here you go. -Thank you.

12
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:44,922
Okay, then the three of us we go out to dinner?

13
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:46,422
Sounds great!

14
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,522
I'm sorry,

15
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,122
but count me out.

16
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:52,322
Why?

17
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:53,822
It's my day off tomorrow,

18
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,922
so I've got a lot of things to do.

19
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,222
I see.

20
00:00:58,222 --> 00:00:59,422
Come to think of it,

21
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,522
I found a delicious noodle shop!

22
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:05,022
Great work, police sergeant!

23
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,922
The pan fried minced pork and vegetable dumpling is really delicious!

24
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:10,622
I look forward to it.

25
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:15,522
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:17,622
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:19,122
What is Inspector Shiratori's memory of first love

28
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,722
that involves Cherry Blossoms?

29
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,522
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,422
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:27,422
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:12,337
"Inspector Shiratori's Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 1)".

33
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:18,137
"White Cliff"

34
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:23,037
Well, all I was planning to do was

35
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,537
to go watch a movie alone, though.

36
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:36,437
Inspector Shiratori?

37
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:41,337
What a coincidence to run into you here!

38
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,337
But, how unexpected.

39
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:45,537
You like this too, don't you, Inspector Shiratori?

40
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,637
Huh? Like, what?

41
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,037
What else, but Gomera!

42
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:51,337
Gomera?

43
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:54,037
No, I'm watching "White Cliff"...

44
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,737
But, the ticket that came out is...

45
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,737
Huh?

46
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,837
"Great Monster Battle"

47
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,437
I guess I chose the category in the wrong row

48
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:05,537
when I reserved it on the Internet.

49
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,837
Let's go get something at the stand

50
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:08,937
before going to our seats!

51
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:11,037
-Yeah! -Let's go!

52
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:13,337
Well, it's my day off that I don't get that often.

53
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,937
I guess it's not that bad going back to feeling like a child, is it?

54
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,637
-His face seems to be saying that. -Huh?

55
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,437
I'll bet it's just something shocking

56
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,737
that involves Officer Sato again, but...

57
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,937
I think it's best to forget about it, no?

58
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,737
Because after all, Officer Sato and Officer Takagi were sort of...

59
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:34,637
You know, what in the hospital room...

60
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,037
I won't give up that easily.

61
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:43,037
After all, she's the person who changed my life, my destiny.

62
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,837
Your destiny?

63
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:45,937
Right.

64
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,937
It was back when I was in elementary school

65
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:52,337
when I was choosing a reference book at a book store.

66
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:56,037
Hold it!

67
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,237
I saw you do it!

68
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:03,737
I saw you put the comics under your clothes!

69
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,537
-You brat... -Hey.

70
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:10,037
Let her be. Let's go.

71
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:11,937
I guess so.

72
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,237
Hold it!

73
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,637
Thief!

74
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,937
Shut up!

75
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:19,737
You darn brat!

76
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,537
I saw what you did too.

77
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:25,737
I saw you both stealing.

78
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:27,437
What're you talking about?

79
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:30,637
Code of law 235.

80
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:33,237
Those who take the property of others

81
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:35,637
shall be accused of stealing

82
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,337
and be sentenced to less than 10 years in prison.

83
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,537
Sentenced?

84
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:41,837
Hey.

85
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,737
Excuse me. Is anything the matter?

86
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:47,937
No.

87
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:52,037
We were just having a brawl over a book with that brat.

88
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,337
Because this comic is pretty popular.

89
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:01,437
Sir.

90
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:04,237
Is anything wrong?

91
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,337
Not really.

92
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,037
It's nothing.

93
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,437
Are you looking for someone?

94
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,637
No.

95
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,137
If you wanted a reference book,

96
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,737
you should've told me

97
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,537
so that I could've bought it for you.

98
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:32,037
No. I need to see it for myself

99
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:35,837
and train myself to choose the best book I can find on my own

100
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:38,737
in order to become an efficient lawyer.

101
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,537
Absolutely.

102
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:49,737
Here, this is for you for helping me out.

103
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:52,237
I bought coke at that fast food shop over there

104
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,937
and made it using the wrapper of the straw as fast as I could,

105
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:57,137
so it's not all that nice, but...

106
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:58,837
Cherry blossoms.

107
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,437
Yep, that's right.

108
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,137
It's a symbol of courage!

109
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:07,337
I don't think that's what Cherry blossoms stood for.

110
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:10,237
But the cherry blossom mark

111
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,437
is what all police officers have on them!

112
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:15,137
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

113
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:17,137
a flower of justice!

114
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,737
I see.

115
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:30,037
That's why you became a police officer.

116
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:31,437
Yeah.

117
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:35,237
That's why when I saw her again at the First Investigation Division,

118
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:38,537
I was convinced that I was destined to marry her.

119
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:41,737
That is, until Officer Takagi appeared.

120
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:45,637
But, was that girl really Officer Sato?

121
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:49,537
Yeah, her facial features are unmistakably.

122
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,337
But, I wonder if that tomboy Officer Sato

123
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,837
would do something like that.

124
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:57,337
That's the only thing that's bothering me.

125
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:58,737
Hey!

126
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:00,937
It's almost time, so let's go inside!

127
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:04,737
Conan and Ai, if you're going to buy drinks, please hurry!

128
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:06,737
I bought popcorn for all of us already!

129
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,837
Thank you for waiting.

130
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,837
-Here you go. -Thanks.

131
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,637
Well, you should go confirm it with Officer Sato.

132
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:21,737
You could be super surprised at how wrong you may be.

133
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,937
Next person, please.

134
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,237
What would you like to order?

135
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,737
Well...

136
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,037
I guess...

137
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:31,637
I'll have a coke.

138
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,637
Thank you for waiting.

139
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:39,237
How wrong I may be?

140
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:42,337
Hey, will you give me the wrapper of your straw?

141
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:43,837
Okay.

142
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,737
What're you going to do?

143
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:49,037
It's a secret.

144
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:57,137
Here! These are our seats!

145
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,237
Wow! It's right in front of the screen!

146
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:02,237
We've need to be grateful to Doc

147
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:05,937
who got us the tickets through the internet.

148
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:08,937
It was forecast that this movie would be crowded.

149
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:13,337
It would've been nice if Doc could've come too.

150
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:16,037
It can't be helped because he had urgent business to attend to.

151
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:20,337
Over here.

152
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:23,137
My seat is right in front of the children's seats.

153
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:29,937
I...I'm sorry!

154
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,337
I was looking for my seat, so I...

155
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,737
-Was it coke? -Yes.

156
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:37,837
I'll go get you a new drink right away!

157
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:47,437
So much for good memories, I guess.

158
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:52,537
I'm sorry about it.

159
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:53,837
Here you go!

160
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:01,137
Flowers...

161
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:04,137
"Nami Kasakura (27)" -It's just a habit of mine since I was a child.

162
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,937
I just can't help making it when I get hold of straw wrappers.

163
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,537
It's just a token of my apology,

164
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,337
but if you don't like it, please take it off.

165
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:14,737
No.

166
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,537
It's the lady we saw a while ago!

167
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:18,537
We're over here!

168
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,737
Those children let me know

169
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,437
that I had forgotten my wallet

170
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,937
on the ticket vending machine a while ago.

171
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,537
I see.

172
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:32,537
But, I didn't think that I would be sitting next to you.

173
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:34,037
Yeah.

174
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:36,337
I feel that it is some work of fate, don't you?

175
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,837
Fate?

176
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:42,537
I guess I exaggerated a bit here.

177
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:45,337
No. I was a bit surprised, though.

178
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:47,737
Huh? Those two...

179
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:49,637
They look good together.

180
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:52,337
This popcorn is good too!

181
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,337
A new love.

182
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,437
Right?

183
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,637
"Gomera"

184
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,337
"Great Monster Battle"

185
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:17,537
Gomera. Gomera.

186
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,137
Please, Gomera.

187
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:23,337
Please let out all the power you have left in you for us.

188
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:26,737
This movie really keeps going at it despite saying this is the last series.

189
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,937
Yeah, the one previous to this was "Farewell Gomera"

190
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:33,237
and the one before that was "Gomera Forever".

191
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:36,037
Well, if the children all like it,

192
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:37,737
that's all that counts, right?

193
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,337
Cell phone?

194
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:52,337
Oh, no.

195
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,137
Gomera's internal organs...

196
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,837
This CG is pretty good, really.

197
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,037
Hey, Ai. That's CG...

198
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,737
Gomera final really was something, wasn't it?

199
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:14,237
Yes. I was really touched!

200
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,037
Are you all right?

201
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,137
Yes. I just lack a little sleep.

202
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,537
It can't be helped!

203
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:23,637
Because police officers usually don't get to sleep much

204
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:26,037
when they're working.

205
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,037
Are you an officer?

206
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:32,337
Yes, although today is my day off.

207
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,637
Is anything wrong?

208
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:40,237
Well, I was planning to go talk to the police about something.

209
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,837
Will you hear me out?

210
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,137
So, it's about a stalker?

211
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:53,237
Yes, I happen to sense something like that since the other day.

212
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:57,237
Didn't you tell your friends or acquaintances about this?

213
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:59,737
I did tell my boyfriend about it.

214
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,437
And he's staying in my room at my condo right now.

215
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,437
Your boyfriend, you say?

216
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,437
Too bad.

217
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,437
Hey, can you scoot over that side a bit there?

218
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,737
Can't do.

219
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,437
Genta, you're taking up too much space.

220
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:17,037
This car's too small.

221
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,537
You guys.

222
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,337
If you don't quiet down a bit, I'm going to let you down.

223
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,237
I see.

224
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,937
Someone is following you,

225
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,037
or rummaging through your trash

226
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,837
or crank calling you.

227
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:33,837
Well, it could all just be my imagination too.

228
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:37,437
I'm back.

229
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,537
I met this police officer today and I...

230
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,008
At the movie theater...

231
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,908
Then, Inspector Shiratori,

232
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:07,708
you're saying that you coincidentally happened to

233
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,408
sit next to Ms. Sasakura in the theater.

234
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:11,408
Yes.

235
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,908
When she found out that I was from the police,

236
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:18,308
she told me that she was being troubled by a stalker.

237
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:21,308
So, I came to her room in this condo

238
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:25,608
and found the body of this man that had been murdered.

239
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,308
The name of the victim is Mr. Yoshiro Kamei, age 30.

240
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:33,308
He works for a stock exchange company nearby.

241
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:39,108
And, he's the man you've been going with, is that right?

242
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,508
Yes.

243
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:43,808
I also told him that I was being troubled by a stalker,

244
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:47,208
and had him come here from about two or three days ago.

245
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,408
According to the coroner's report,

246
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:52,808
the estimated time of death is around 14:00 today.

247
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,308
He was beaten to death.

248
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:58,808
He seems to have been struck with a hard rod like object.

249
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:01,608
Was the door locked when you came back?

250
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,508
It was opened,

251
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:07,608
but the spare key that he usual has attached to his hips is gone,

252
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,108
so maybe...

253
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,708
It could be that the culprit made away

254
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:15,108
after locking the door with the spare key then.

255
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:18,408
In order to delay the discovery of the victim as much as possible.

256
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:25,108
If that stalker had abnormal feelings of love for you,

257
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:32,108
it's no wonder if he had bitter feelings against your boyfriend

258
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,608
who was sleeping over at your place.

259
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,008
No... no way.

260
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,708
Or...

261
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,908
you made it look that way after you killed him.

262
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:49,508
Please wait a minute, Inspector Megure.

263
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,708
If it was about 14:00, she was at the theatre

264
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,608
sitting next to me and watching the movie.

265
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,808
She couldn't have done it.

266
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:01,708
But, it only takes about five minutes from here to the theater.

267
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,308
She could've slipped out of the theater

268
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:04,908
saying she was going to the restroom,

269
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:09,008
take the cab, commit the murder then come back with the cab again.

270
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:13,408
Well, if you can testify that she was beside you all the while,

271
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,608
then there would be no problem.

272
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,608
No, I can't because I dozed off part way.

273
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,308
Inspector Megure.

274
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,908
It seems that the victim did make a call to someone at around 14:00,

275
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:28,408
the time the murder was committed.

276
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,808
What?

277
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,508
That could be me.

278
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:35,408
I got a call while I was watching the movie,

279
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,608
so I rushed to hang up.

280
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:40,508
I forgot to turn off my cell phone before the movie started, you see.

281
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:43,408
Do you remember this?

282
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:48,808
No. I seem to have been sleeping just then.

283
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,508
I saw!

284
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,008
Just what do you mean?

285
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:56,108
While I was watching the movie, light suddenly flashed.

286
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:58,908
I saw the hat of that lady!

287
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:01,408
I think that the light leaked

288
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:04,708
when I opened the cell phone to switch it off.

289
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:09,008
If that call was from her boyfriend who was killed,

290
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,308
it would serve as a perfect alibi, wouldn't it?

291
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:14,508
That... that's true, but...

292
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,108
How come you're all here?

293
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:21,808
Because that lady said that she'd treat us to something to eat.

294
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,008
Something to eat?

295
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,808
Yes, as a reward for us telling her

296
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,908
that she had forgotten her wallet

297
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:32,208
on the ticket vending machine.

298
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,308
But, we were even more surprised

299
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,208
after her cell phone flashed light, right?

300
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,808
Yeah, I was really scared!

301
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,908
Huh? What happened?

302
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:46,108
That's probably the scene when Gomera was beat up

303
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,508
and its internal organs were in view.

304
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:52,308
That scene was really grotesque, so...

305
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,408
You... you mean the monster Gomera?

306
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,708
Yes.

307
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,808
That's the kind of movie you were watching?

308
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:00,808
I like special effects. Is there anything wrong with that?

309
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:03,908
Well, that scene was grotesque too, but...

310
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,308
What was really surprising was...

311
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,408
The scene after that when...

312
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,108
The scene when Gomera bit the other monster's neck,

313
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,908
shattered it!

314
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:16,808
The amount of blood that splattered was unreal.

315
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:20,608
Were you watching the same movie too, Inspector Shiratori?

316
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,608
Yes, well...

317
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:25,508
And? There's no mistake that

318
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,308
you were watching the movie from 13:00 to 15:00?

319
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,808
Yes. To put it accurately,

320
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,108
from 13:05...

321
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:39,408
This is... If I remember correctly,

322
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:41,608
this is what was attached to the cup of coke

323
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:44,708
that Ms. Sasakura bought for Inspector Shiratori.

324
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,508
It started from 13:05 to 14:50

325
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,408
for an hour and 45 minutes.

326
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,108
Well, just to be sure,

327
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:59,708
let's have Officer Takagi go confirm at the theater

328
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,408
whether she really didn't go outside while the movie was being shown.

329
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,908
Because there is a little something that is bothering me too.

330
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:08,108
Then, Officer Takagi, I'm counting on you.

331
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,908
Yes, sir!

332
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,208
And...

333
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:15,508
in the meantime, we would like to check inside the room.

334
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:18,808
-Is it all right? -Yes.

335
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,308
If you were being followed by a stalker,

336
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:23,708
there's a chance of a wiretap being set up somewhere in the room

337
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,508
as well as a hidden camera, isn't there?

338
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,608
Right.

339
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,508
I'm counting on you then.

340
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,008
Conan.

341
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,408
You don't have to help investigate.

342
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:56,708
Will you stay still in the corner of the room?

343
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,208
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:02,708
Inspector Shiratori, did you find anything?

345
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,308
No, not really.

346
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:08,708
Did you see anything in this room that you don't know about?

347
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,108
Not really.

348
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,408
Hey, Ayumi.

349
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,608
What're you doing from a while ago?

350
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,008
Flowers!

351
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:25,208
-Flowers? -Flowers?

352
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,508
Right!

353
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:29,708
First, you tear the proliferated part of the wrapper of the straw carefully

354
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,708
into a narrow strip.

355
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:41,008
Then you fold it one on top of the other,

356
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:42,708
like this.

357
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,608
Then you put the folded paper together

358
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,008
and tear it in this shape.

359
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:49,708
-If you tear it? -If you tear it?

360
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:55,708
Here you go! A strip of flowers!

361
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,808
-Fantastic! -Very pretty!

362
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,708
What're they doing at the murder site?

363
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,808
And?

364
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:09,108
So what? Is the culprit Ms. Sasakura after all?

365
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:13,108
You were shooting her that kind of look just a while ago, weren't you?

366
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:14,408
Yeah.

367
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:17,508
She said she was a fan of special effects,

368
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:20,708
but I was thinking that she didn't have any monster figurines

369
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,208
or books on the subject.

370
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,208
That's not all, is it?

371
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,008
The reason why you're suspecting her.

372
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,708
Besides, we're her witnesses.

373
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,508
The seats of the theater.

374
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,608
Seats?

375
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,408
Didn't you think it was strange?

376
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:38,008
Seats, if I remember correctly...

377
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:41,508
All five of us were in the middle front row seats.

378
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,708
The seats of Inspector Shiratori and Nami

379
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,308
were right in front of ours with the corridor in between, right?

380
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,508
What's strange about that?

381
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,108
We went to see the Sunday afternoon show.

382
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:57,008
It was naturally packed with parents and children,

383
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,708
but for some reason the seats on both sides of Inspector Shiratori and Nami

384
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,308
were empty.

385
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:03,308
Maybe it was just a coincidence?

386
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:04,908
Besides,

387
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,908
it also bothers me that we are witnesses who are proving her alibi

388
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:11,308
when we just happened to run into her today.

389
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,908
But, you saw her too, didn't you?

390
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:16,908
That she was in the theater at the time the murder was committed.

391
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:18,908
Yeah, I saw her.

392
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:21,208
Hat, that is.

393
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,908
Hey, don't tell me that...

394
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,108
Well, I'm pretty sure it'll be okay.

395
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:29,808
Probably, Inspector Shiratori seems to have realized that too,

396
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,708
and sent Officer Takagi over to the theater.

397
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:37,708
With the proof hidden in his pocket.

398
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,000
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
"Hat".

400
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,040
In the next episode, Inspector Shiratori and that person

401
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,900
will make close contact! Talk about unexpected...
