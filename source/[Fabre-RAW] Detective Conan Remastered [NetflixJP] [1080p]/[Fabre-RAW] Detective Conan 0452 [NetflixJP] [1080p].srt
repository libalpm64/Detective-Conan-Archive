1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,119
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,019
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,519
Today's episode is a one-hour special!

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,719
It's the long awaited travelling performers' troupe story.

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:15,519
A phantom appears on the stage of Konpira!

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,919
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,519
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,619
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,819
This is just great!

10
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,819
It's nice and easygoing.

11
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,319
Yep.

12
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,319
I'm thirsty. I'd like a shot of beer, I tell you!

13
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,419
Dad, we've come all the way to Shikoku, you know.

14
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,819
We should be more interested in eating than drinking!

15
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,419
-Sanuki udon! -Sanuki udon!

16
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:15,919
I know.

17
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,119
That's why I want to moisten my mouth a little before that.

18
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:23,119
I'll bet you'll drink and fall asleep during the performance.

19
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:27,419
Right, I mean after Tamanosuke invited us and all!

20
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,219
I know.

21
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,619
Hey, the opera house that Tamanosuke and his troupe is going to perform

22
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:35,419
at called Kanamaru-za is a very famous place, isn't it?

23
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,519
Right!

24
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,119
Every spring they perform

25
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:40,819
the "Shikoku Konpira Kabuki Great Performance",

26
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,919
"Konpira Station" -every year a huge number of people come to watch it.

27
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,319
Look, look!

28
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,119
You're right. Amazing!

29
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,619
This is sure going to be something to look forward to!

30
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,719
"The Phantom of Konpira"

31
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,519
"Miyatake Hand-made Udon"

32
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,819
Is this the noodle shop that was recommended?

33
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,219
It looks like an ordinary house.

34
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,019
Welcome!

35
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,919
Well, well, appetizers to go with beer!

36
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,419
These are toppings to be put into the udon, Dad!

37
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,519
"Menu" -Thank you for waiting.

38
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,719
Oh, here it comes.

39
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,419
The tempura is over there so help yourself to as much as you like.

40
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:22,619
Okay!

41
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,119
It's delicious!

42
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,719
They just take your tongue with them!

43
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,719
This is really the real taste.

44
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,719
This sure is the taste of the genuine!

45
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,419
Okay, I've made up my mind!

46
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,619
Made up your mind?

47
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,419
I mean that, that.

48
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,619
What?

49
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:46,519
"Sanuki Udon roaming eating contest"?

50
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,319
"Omotesandou" -Hey, you girls over there!

51
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,819
Please use this cane.

52
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,819
Just return it when you come back down.

53
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,719
-Thank you! -Thank you very much.

54
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,219
Canes, my foot. I mean we're not old.

55
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,919
How many steps are there here anyway?

56
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,619
Until the main shrine which is at the very top,

57
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,819
it seems there are 785 steps all together.

58
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,919
Seven hundred...

59
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,919
And eighty-five?

60
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,519
Easy, easy, duck soup!

61
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,419
"100th stage" -We said to begin with that

62
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,619
if there's something as convenient as this.

63
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,819
Where's dad?

64
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,819
Over there.

65
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,319
This is so good!

66
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,219
Locally brewed sake sure is different!

67
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:35,719
Dad!

68
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,119
What about praying at the shrine?

69
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,519
Sorry, but pray for me too while you're at it!

70
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,719
What?

71
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,519
Besides, Kanamaru-za is right there, isn't it?

72
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,019
I'll wait for you guys here.

73
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,719
Miss! One more serving, please!

74
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,719
What happened to tasting udon at different restaurants?

75
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,619
I've finally made it.

76
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,719
It's so unfair only getting to ride the basket half way up!

77
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,419
What took you so long, Sonoko?

78
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,819
You should've stayed below and rested together with Dad!

79
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,519
Hey, don't put me in the same boat as Pops!

80
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,719
Konpira is the god that protects the sea, isn't it?

81
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,719
Right. It says that it is worshipped fervently by people who work at sea.

82
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,819
It's about time. Shall we head for Kanamaru-za?

83
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,319
Let's go!

84
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,219
I wonder if Tamanosuke is doing okay.

85
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,619
Yes, and Renge too.

86
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,319
-Right! That's the point! -What?

87
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,519
I wonder if those two are still lovey-dovey with each other.

88
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,319
-I've got my eyes on Tamanosuke, you see. -Come on, Sonoko.

89
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,919
What's with everybody...

90
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,782
Hello, everyone.

91
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:56,582
Thank you for coming such a long way.

92
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:58,782
This is hopeless.

93
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,082
I guess they're doing well.

94
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,582
You can tell just by looking at them that they're in love.

95
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:04,882
Conan!

96
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,282
Megumi.

97
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,082
Hello.

98
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,182
What's the matter?

99
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:12,682
The little ones are not here today, are they?

100
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:14,382
Oh, those kids?

101
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,582
They sort of couldn't make it.

102
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,482
I'm glad. It makes me so happy!

103
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:20,082
Hey, Megumi.

104
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:22,382
Hey, hey, what's this glasses kid!

105
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,482
You're popular, aren't you?

106
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,682
I'm gonna get you.

107
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,082
Conan.

108
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:29,282
This way, please.

109
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:32,782
It's a crawl-in entrance, so please watch your head.

110
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:34,782
And what's a crawl-in entrance?

111
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:37,782
-It's hurt... -Dad!

112
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,782
Are you all right?

113
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,482
I knew he'd do that.

114
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,782
We're still making preparations for the performance

115
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,982
so everyone's still busy here.

116
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:50,882
My, how fantastic!

117
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:53,782
Oh, they're right in the midst of checking the movement

118
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,782
"Seri (Trapdoor)" -of the trapdoor on stage.

119
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,982
Trapdoor?

120
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:00,282
It's being pushed up by a lot of stagehands in the basement.

121
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:03,382
The actors come out from there and pose.

122
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,182
The stage is moving!

123
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,882
That's a revolving stage.

124
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:10,282
Likewise, stagehands are pushing from the basement and turning the stage.

125
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:12,182
They're doing it in the same way as was done in the past.

126
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,782
They used to call the basement Naraku (pitfall) in the past,

127
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,782
because water drainage was bad

128
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:18,682
and the stagehands had it tough.

129
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:20,782
That's how it ended up being called that way.

130
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:23,182
That path on the other side is the flowery way.

131
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:24,782
The actors come from the birdhouse beyond

132
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,182
weaving through the audience and appear, then head towards the stage.

133
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,382
The thing you see part way along the way

134
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,582
is the Suppon (Soft-shelled turtle).

135
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,182
Just like the trapdoor that you just saw,

136
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:35,182
it is devised to rise from below.

137
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:37,682
And the thing right above the flowery way

138
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:40,182
that looks like a crane is called "Kakesuji".

139
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,982
It's used to pull the actors up and suspend them in air.

140
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,782
That's amazing!

141
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:47,482
"Grape vine trellis" -The ceiling is made of bamboo in trelliswork,

142
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:51,882
and confetti of cherry blossom petals are scattered from there.

143
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:54,182
"Balcony seat" -It's like we've time slipped 100 years back!

144
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,582
True!

145
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:57,682
It's even further back than 100 years.

146
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,882
Kanamaru-za was originally built towards

147
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:02,082
the end of the Edo Period, in the year of Tenpo

148
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,282
after approval from the shogunate.

149
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:07,982
It is the oldest playhouse in existence in Japan.

150
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:12,582
It's really an honor for an actor to be able to perform here.

151
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:15,082
Besides, you're both love-dovey too...

152
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:17,582
Sonoko.

153
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:20,282
I heard that you will be doing a performance of a samurai show

154
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,382
that takes after the Phantom of the Opera today.

155
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:25,282
That's right. This is a gruesome story of love and hate,

156
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,182
takes place on the flamboyant stage of this opera house,

157
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:31,682
between a mysterious phantom who covers his ugly dreadful face with a mask,

158
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:35,982
and a pretty singing princess and her lover.

159
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,082
Taking after the Phantom of the Opera, this is the Phantom of the Konpira!

160
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:51,482
-You're arrested! -Arrested!

161
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,982
My beloved princess, sing!

162
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,182
For me, who loves you!

163
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,182
For the angel of music!

164
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:02,882
Sing! You must sing!

165
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:06,282
You pure angel! Brilliant angel!

166
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:09,582
Take my soul way up to heaven!

167
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,082
Don't sing! Wake up!

168
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:14,782
That's the devil! It's a ghost!

169
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,082
How nice.

170
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,382
Hey, who's that?

171
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,682
He is Mr. Tatsuhiko Rausu, who's going to be supporting

172
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,282
our performance this time.

173
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,082
A sponsor.

174
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:27,282
Rausu?

175
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:29,582
The Rausu Concieron in Kansai?

176
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,382
I did read about it in the papers.

177
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:33,182
The family head passed away

178
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:37,982
and his yet young son became his successor.

179
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:39,682
Hi there!

180
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,182
Oh, no! Don't...

181
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,682
Not all of sudden like that.

182
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:48,582
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

183
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:50,282
Give it your best shot, Renge!

184
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:52,182
Yes, I will. Renge?

185
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:56,882
I, Tatsuhiko Rausu is with you all the way!

186
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:57,982
Thank you.

187
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:01,482
But, I only play a small part in this play.

188
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,582
I was thinking about that, but no matter how much I think about it,

189
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,882
you're the only one fit to play the role of the heroine singing princess.

190
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,482
-So, why not change... -Mr. Rausu!

191
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,282
I, the leader of this troupe is who decides,

192
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:13,682
not you, the sponsor.

193
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:16,082
Neither the phantom, right?

194
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,482
Absolutely.

195
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,682
Phantom?

196
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:21,282
You have no intention of taking in my request, do you?

197
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,382
Of course not!

198
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:24,582
Well, all I wanted to do was see my childhood friend

199
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,282
at her proud moment appearing as the star of the show.

200
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:31,682
Request. Changing heroines.

201
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,982
Childhood friend and the phantom.

202
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,482
This sounds just like that famous opera...

203
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:40,382
The Phantom of the Opera.

204
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:43,982
It's exactly that, don't you think?

205
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:46,882
He's Renge's childhood friend.

206
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:52,782
Wouldn't it be better if you would be a little more honest, Tamanosuke?

207
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,982
I'm talking about the feelings you have for Renge.

208
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:56,182
You like her, don't you?

209
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,382
Mr. Rausu.

210
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:01,382
If you dilly-dally, I'm going to take her away from you.

211
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,282
It's a love triangle?

212
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,482
Sonoko!

213
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:10,582
I don't mind, troupe leader.

214
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,382
I'll give Renge my role.

215
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,982
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:17,382
Don't be silly.

217
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:21,282
The purpose we had you come here would completely be lost!

218
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:22,682
That's right!

219
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,682
I've been your fan all this time!

220
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:27,782
Just sharing the stage with you will make me happy.

221
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,482
Thank you.

222
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,082
What a beauty!

223
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,882
She sure looks familiar...

224
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,282
Ms. Romi Karube.

225
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:37,982
She's a famous young stage actress.

226
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:41,382
Big brother went to ask her to act the heroine part for this play.

227
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:44,182
He was sure that she was going to refuse, but on the contrary,

228
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:46,182
she surprisingly agreed immediately.

229
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,682
Oh well, I'm so very sorry.

230
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,182
Please do your best.

231
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:55,582
Well, well, I guess she doesn't like me.

232
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:01,982
I'm really can't see well in dark places.

233
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,982
Somebody! Give him the luminous tape for sponsor.

234
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,182
Luminous?

235
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,782
Does she mean this?

236
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,982
What a dirty tape.

237
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:11,482
It's tape that shines in the dark.

238
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,382
Look. There are some over there too.

239
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:16,082
You're a smart fellow, sonny.

240
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:19,382
You're right, when the stage turns dark, it is pasted on the stage

241
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:22,282
so that the performers don't stand in the wrong place.

242
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:29,782
Either way, you don't have a chance, Sonoko.

243
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,482
I'm just fine.

244
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:33,882
-I've found someone else. -Someone else?

245
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:36,182
"Otoya Kawatake (25), Actor" -So we're finally starting practice.

246
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,882
Talk about a slow moving stage performance.

247
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,582
But, all I'm interested in is my role so...

248
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,482
He's so cool.

249
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,282
Move it, move it! Out of my way!

250
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:47,182
Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:51,482
Who let them in? It's no time to let the audience in yet, is it?

252
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,582
What a snob.

253
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,882
Sonoko!

254
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:57,082
I'm sorry, Mr. Nabe. I should've introduced them to you earlier.

255
00:12:57,082 --> 00:13:00,182
He is Detective Kogoro Mouri and...

256
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:01,482
A detective?

257
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:02,782
Kogoro Mouri?

258
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,382
You mean that famous...

259
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:09,182
Yes, I am the famous Kogoro Mouri!

260
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:11,482
His daughter, Ran.

261
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,582
Nice to meet you.

262
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,582
And...

263
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:16,182
He's the boy I love, Conan Edogawa!

264
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,682
How do you do?

265
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:21,182
-And she is... -I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

266
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,382
Nice to meet you.

267
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:27,482
I don't care who, I don't like people getting in the way of my job.

268
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:29,982
The former leader was stricter when it came to things like this.

269
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:32,182
Father is father and I'm me.

270
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,782
Well, but I wouldn't have been able to pay my debts back

271
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,282
if it hadn't been for this job,

272
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,582
so I am grateful to you, leader.

273
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:41,782
Hey, let's go!

274
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,182
-Yes, sir! -Don't get in the way of practice.

275
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,582
Okay, let's begin!

276
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:53,482
Renge, will you go to my room backstage and get me my mouthwash?

277
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,082
-All right. -Conan and the rest, go sit in the audience.

278
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,282
Okay!

279
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,782
Watch out!

280
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:18,582
Romi!

281
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,782
Are you all right? Romi!

282
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,336
Romi!

283
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,836
What's this?

284
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,736
Somebody, get an ambulance! Call the ambulance!

285
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,936
No, leader.

286
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:36,836
It's no big thing. I'm not all that hurt.

287
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,136
Romi.

288
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,936
It's just a scratch.

289
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:43,636
But, this stage is known for coming in close contact with the audience,

290
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,936
so I've got to wear a bit more greasepaint than usual.

291
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:48,536
Shoots, how dare...

292
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:50,736
What dirt bag could've done something like this?

293
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,636
Empty that place up right away!

294
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:53,936
We've got to fix this up immediately

295
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,936
or we won't be able to make it in time for the show!

296
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,036
He's the pits! He's the one who did it!

297
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:00,036
Sonoko.

298
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,536
Let's give her treatment immediately.

299
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,936
Let's go to your room backstage, Romi.

300
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,636
There's a cut that looks like it's been slashed

301
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:08,636
with a knife or something on that rope.

302
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,936
Could it be the work of the phantom?

303
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:14,336
Don't be silly!

304
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:16,336
That's just some sort of prank.

305
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,536
Then, what about this?

306
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:21,636
If worse comes to worse, we may really have to change heroines.

307
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,436
I won't let that happen.

308
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:26,136
This is really challenging.

309
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:28,736
I won't let the phantom has his way.

310
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:30,636
Right, leader?

311
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:33,636
Uh, I hate to interrupt your conversation,

312
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:34,936
but what is this phantom thing about?

313
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,836
The Phantom of the Konpira!

314
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,236
Like I was saying, that's not...

315
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:41,136
If I remember correctly, that's the title of this performance,

316
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:42,736
Phantom of the Konpira.

317
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,636
Yes, but...

318
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:47,236
I see! It's the chandelier, the chandelier!

319
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:49,036
Right!

320
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,236
Chandelier?

321
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:55,136
Well, this stage that made after the Phantom of the Opera...

322
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,736
A chandelier's going to come falling onto

323
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,936
the first actress that acts the role of the heroine.

324
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:05,436
Not only that, the connection you have with one another,

325
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:09,636
greatly resembles the character setting of the Phantom of the Opera!

326
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,036
Come to think of it, you mentioned that

327
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,936
you wouldn't give in to the demand of the phantom

328
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,236
just a while ago, didn't you, Tamanosuke?

329
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:16,736
That's what exactly how it went in the story too!

330
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,036
But in the Phantom of the Opera,

331
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:21,036
the phantom was the one who demanded that the heroine be changed.

332
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:24,036
What does this mean?

333
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:27,936
It seems that you all have some you're hiding from us.

334
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:31,636
Well, well, as expected of a famous detective.

335
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:36,836
Tamanosuke, maybe we should tell Mr. Mouri about it already?

336
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,136
All right.

337
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:45,036
At first, I thought it was just a prank that someone was playing on us.

338
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:52,236
After all, it didn't really do anything

339
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:56,536
but, appear and scare people.

340
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,036
However...

341
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,536
10 of these types of letters

342
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,336
"To troupe leader" -were delivered here.

343
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:07,636
The contents are all the same.

344
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:10,136
What in earth is the meaning of this?

345
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:13,936
"Get a large audience, you shall be stabbed to death in the end."

346
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,536
"Phantom of the Konpira."

347
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,636
It's only natural to want to get a large audience.

348
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,836
I mean, after all this is a stage play.

349
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,836
"You shall be stabbed to death in the end"

350
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,836
sure sounds like a dialogue in the play too.

351
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,936
Isn't that a code? About the word "Sanuki"?

352
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:29,636
It's amazing you figured it out, sonny!

353
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,036
Sanuki?

354
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:34,136
What bothers me is that the code is too easy to decipher.

355
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,536
Sanuki...

356
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:40,136
Oh, I see! Sanuki means

357
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:43,336
removing the letter "sa" from the sentence and read it!

358
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:44,736
Let's see.

359
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:48,336
It may be easier if you changed the entire sentence into hiragana first.

360
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,036
So, the "sa" is removed.

361
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,436
Then...

362
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,436
That's incredible!

363
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,636
"Change the heroine to Renge"?

364
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:59,336
This is genuine blackmail!

365
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,636
But, if we take every such thing that we get seriously,

366
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,136
we can't be doing any stage performance!

367
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,436
Exactly.

368
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:08,236
But, after ignoring it, look what just happened a while ago.

369
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:11,136
So, it wasn't just a simple threat.

370
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:15,236
Which means, something else is bound to happen.

371
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,436
Leader.

372
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:18,936
I'm going through with this!

373
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,636
If it's okay with you, Romi...

374
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:22,636
Well, if you quit because of something like this,

375
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,036
I guess you can't be called an actress.

376
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,736
Hey, hey.

377
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,736
Are things going to be okay, Mr. Mouri?

378
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,936
There seems to be no direct connection

379
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:34,036
between the blackmail and collapse of the paper lantern.

380
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:35,436
And as for the cut found in the rope,

381
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:37,136
we've got to investigate further

382
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:39,636
to see if it was really cut with a knife too.

383
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:40,736
True.

384
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:43,936
Even if the police were to do something right now,

385
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,436
as far as the play is concerned,

386
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:49,936
they would have no choice but to leave the final decision up to the leader.

387
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:53,536
Okay, all set, the cast stands as is.

388
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,036
I want you all to do your best at today's show,

389
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:59,036
as well as tomorrow's general public performance.

390
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,236
Come, my beloved child!

391
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:23,336
Believe me and sing!

392
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,236
Those who believe in me shall not die!

393
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,536
Who is it?

394
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:29,936
Please wait!

395
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,336
Are you god?

396
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,436
Or are you the devil?

397
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:36,136
He's the devil! I shall punish you!

398
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:39,736
You inhabitant of the world of darkness where there is no light!

399
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:45,036
You ignorant and impudent youth! You shall be cursed!

400
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:48,436
You who attempt to take away my love and victory,

401
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:52,736
shall learn of the power of the world of darkness!

402
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,436
How touching!

403
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:01,336
Just as I thought. Dad drank again after that so...

404
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,836
What is she looking at from some time ago?

405
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:11,836
That's...

406
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,836
Hey, what's that?

407
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:17,436
Look there!

408
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,636
What happened?

409
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,036
Who is that jerk?

410
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,036
-What's up? -What's wrong?

411
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,436
What's with her voice?

412
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,036
That's...

413
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,336
She sounds just like...

414
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,736
A frog.

415
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,636
What's wrong with her?

416
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,836
This is the same as the Phantom of the Opera too!

417
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,136
Seriously?

418
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:54,536
Darn, where'd he go?

419
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,236
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

420
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:57,736
Romi, come back!

421
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,136
What's happening?

422
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,836
This is the only way in or out.

423
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,336
There are this many people in the audience and yet,

424
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:17,536
no one seems to have noticed the phantom passing through at all.

425
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:19,236
Why?

426
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:21,836
What's that?

427
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,136
Hey, brat, what're you doing?

428
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:32,736
Well, I thought it was fun being in a high place like this so I...

429
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:33,936
This isn't an amusement park!

430
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,636
Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!

431
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:37,636
I'm sorry!

432
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:41,236
Someone switch Romi's mouthwash?

433
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:44,136
She thought it was the same mouthwash as usual.

434
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,736
After the curtains went up, she went ahead and drank it.

435
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:49,736
Then...

436
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,436
How cruel. Who could've done something like that?

437
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,036
Don't tell me that...

438
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:56,236
Never mind that for now.

439
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:58,636
The problem is what to do about this stage performance.

440
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:02,736
You were Romi's prompter, weren't you?

441
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,336
You know the lines, don't you?

442
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,436
Don't tell me that you want me to...

443
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:08,436
We've no time to be arguing.

444
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,236
The audience is waiting!

445
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,636
But...

446
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,836
The curtains are down now but we'll open them in 15 minutes.

447
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:21,936
So, hurry!

448
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,636
The phantom? It' probably just a part of the performance.

449
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:32,336
It seems that the others in the audience think so too, but...

450
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:34,736
Where's Conan?

451
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:40,936
A dead end, huh? This is almost like a labyrinth.

452
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,736
Don't be afraid, my beloved child.

453
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,836
Who's there?

454
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:56,536
This is not too good... where am I?

455
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:00,636
I wonder if I can do it.

456
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:03,836
I wonder if I can act out Romi's part all right.

457
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:05,736
Don't worry.

458
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:06,736
The phantom?

459
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:10,936
I, the angle of music is with you.

460
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:22,836
Nobody's inside?

461
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,836
What's going on?

462
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:30,936
After meeting him, my heart was filled with joy.

463
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:33,236
But, he is an inhabitant of the world of darkness.

464
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:35,536
I am a captive of darkness.

465
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:38,436
Let's stop talking of the world of darkness.

466
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:42,336
I shall guide you to the world of light.

467
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,036
I shall be with you wherever you go!

468
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,936
Conan, where were you?

469
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:47,036
To the restroom.

470
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:50,336
Please swear that I am your only love.

471
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:54,336
I swear that you are my only love.

472
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:56,636
There is no way you can go back,

473
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,936
since you have already come here,

474
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,336
to this basement cell that is shut off from all things

475
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:02,836
and everything vanishes in darkness!

476
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:05,936
I am not afraid of your appearance.

477
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:09,936
What frightens me is your distorted heart!

478
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:11,636
Renge is fantastic!

479
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:13,636
She sure doesn't seem like a substitute actress at all!

480
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:15,536
This showing is a whopping success.

481
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:18,736
That substitute actress is fantastic!

482
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,436
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's show.

483
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:40,536
Shoots, this place is so eerie.

484
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:01,936
This is...

485
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,336
What on earth...

486
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:06,636
Mr. Nabe?

487
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,136
Freeze!

488
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,936
Stay right there and don't move!

489
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:12,836
No! I didn't do it!

490
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,236
I didn't kill him!

491
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,520
What did you just say?

492
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,020
Tamanosuke was arrested?

493
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,120
Yes.

494
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,920
Conan, please save my brother...

495
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,120
Calm down, Megumi!

496
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,020
What on earth is going on?

497
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,720
He's being charged for killing Mr. Nabeshima

498
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,520
who is in charge of stage settings.

499
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,220
Tamanosuke would never do a thing like that!

500
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,320
But, they say he was found lying on the ground

501
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,620
holding a knife, right beside Mr. Nabeshima.

502
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,020
You mean he was passed out?

503
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,720
Moreover, he seems to have been wearing

504
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,520
a blood smeared mask of the phantom.

505
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,820
So, they say that this phantom fuss up to now

506
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,720
was all the doings of the leader.

507
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,620
No way. Dad, let's go to the police station now.

508
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,420
Okay.

509
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,520
"Interrogation Room 1" -You were called out by a letter?

510
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,720
Yes.

511
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,320
"Be gone!"

512
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,720
"I want to put flowers to the small dying village."

513
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,420
"Stone monument's morning, at the base I will wait."

514
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,720
"Rausu."

515
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,220
This is also a code where the "sa" in the sentences

516
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,020
must be removed to read, right?

517
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,620
Just like the other blackmails

518
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,920
received from the phantom of the Konpira or what-nots.

519
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,220
That's right.

520
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,420
And if you redo it to make a normal sentence...

521
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,620
"I want to talk to you about Renge".

522
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,120
"I'll be waiting for you at the open lot by the monument".

523
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,620
And, when you got to the site...

524
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,220
Exactly!

525
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,120
But why would somebody do something like that?

526
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,420
That's because that person is indeed the phantom of the Konpira.

527
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,820
He's the one who sent letters

528
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,520
demanding that the heroine be changed,

529
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,220
dropped the big lantern on top of Romi

530
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,020
and switched her mouthwash to something else.

531
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,320
That's the only thing thinkable!

532
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,720
About that, Mr. Rausu was saying the same thing.

533
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
He said though, that he was called by you.

534
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,020
What?

535
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,220
No, no, I'm not saying that Tamanosuke is the phantom.

536
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,620
But, it's true that he asked me to come meet him.

537
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,920
So, this is the letter.

538
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,220
Tamanosuke says that he received a letter exactly like this.

539
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,520
However, "park" had been changed to "monument"

540
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,720
and your name is written as the sender.

541
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,420
And did you go there?

542
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,920
I did, but Tamanosuke didn't come.

543
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,420
Most naturally,

544
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,520
because at that time he was at the scene of the crime.

545
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,720
Then, did you meet or see anyone at the park?

546
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,220
Yeah, I did.

547
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,020
Romi?

548
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,020
So, although you didn't notice that Mr. Rausu was there,

549
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,620
you were in the vacant lot of the park.

550
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,120
What did you go there for?

551
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,220
"I was practicing my voice in secret."

552
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,720
I see.

553
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,020
I'm honored

554
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,120
to be able to conduct investigation together with you, Mr. Mouri.

555
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,520
The evidence that you have deeming Tamanosuke Ito to be the suspect

556
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,020
is the murder weapon knife that he was holding, was it?

557
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Yes!

558
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,520
But Tamanosuke was passed out, wasn't he?

559
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,220
It could be that someone else made him hold the knife, right?

560
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
That's right.

561
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,420
I'm sure that's what happened.

562
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,520
And, what do you have to say about that?

563
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,520
He did have a wound on the back of his head.

564
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
But it could be that he fought with the victim but slipped,

565
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,420
and hit his head on the corner of the pedestal or something.

566
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,520
Corner of the pedestal?

567
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
Please explain.

568
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,320
All right.

569
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,220
Behind the victim that was lying on the ground, is a memorial monument

570
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,220
and there is a pedestal.

571
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,520
And what is his motive for killing the man?

572
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,420
Most likely, money problems.

573
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,120
It seems that the victim used to demand advance payments

574
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,820
and other things quite impossible to do,

575
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,920
being that he was a staff member from the time of the former leader.

576
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Therefore, Tamanosuke finally...

577
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
That can't be...

578
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
You're not serious, are you?

579
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,220
Another thing! The most serious point is...

580
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,520
that he tried to frame Mr. Rausu up as the phantom of the Konpira,

581
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,020
place the blame on him and win Renge's heart over.

582
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,420
That just can't be because those two are already...

583
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,720
In love with each other to begin with.

584
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,520
Although it's vexing to think so.

585
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,720
So, he wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.

586
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,820
That's why! It's all probably because Mr. Rausu appeared.

587
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,120
You can never tell what goes on between a man and a woman

588
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,020
just by looking on the outside, you see.

589
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,620
No.

590
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,920
I guess they won't be showing the play today.

591
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Not with the leader taken to the police as a suspect.

592
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,820
How disappointing. Renge Kataoka's acting was pretty good.

593
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,320
You believe Tamanosuke, don't you?

594
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,820
And I know he believes in me too.

595
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,120
That's why he let me substitute for Romi.

596
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,320
You were fantastic.

597
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,720
But, I was scared.

598
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I was so sure I couldn't do it.

599
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,720
But the angel of music,

600
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,520
the phantom encouraged me.

601
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,720
What?

602
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,020
You're not the one, are you?

603
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,920
You're not suspecting me, are you?

604
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,820
I don't know what or who I should believe.

605
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,820
If you're going through so much suffering,

606
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,220
drop this acting bit all together!

607
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,620
Renge, I want you to spend your life together with me.

608
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,220
Is he serious?

609
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,220
I'm sorry. I'm worried about the troupe leader right now

610
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,320
and can't think of anything else...

611
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,820
Okay, then please relay this to the leader.

612
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,020
The damage I have incurred as a sponsor is great.

613
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,420
I hate to say this, but if things go on as is,

614
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,820
I have no choice but to pull out.

615
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,020
Oh no!

616
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,020
However, when it comes to you, it's a different story.

617
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,820
I will not give up, no matter what.

618
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm sorry.

619
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,020
I didn't mean to eavesdrop but...

620
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,820
Hey, hey, is it true

621
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,220
that you were encouraged by the phantom?

622
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,820
But, I couldn't jump up for joy.

623
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,920
When I heard the applause, I kind of got carried away for an instant...

624
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,320
Don't worry, you've got talent!

625
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,220
But the new heroine being encouraged by the phantom,

626
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,320
that's how it goes in the Phantom of the Opera too.

627
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,820
Yes, that scares me too.

628
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,920
I wonder who on earth it is.

629
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,420
If it's not Tamanosuke, could it be Mr. Rausu after all?

630
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,520
Or, could it really be the phantom?

631
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,120
A ghost or a monster?

632
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,720
No, that's impossible.

633
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Here it is!

634
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,520
What is it, Conan?

635
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
What's that?

636
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,320
A speaker?

637
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Yes, a wireless. It probably goes from here to...

638
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,920
In fact, I heard the voice of the phantom that day too.

639
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,520
Really, Conan?

640
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,020
Which means, in other words...

641
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,420
The phantom of the Konpira is neither a ghost nor a monster.

642
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,720
I'll go ask dad one more time!

643
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm going with you!

644
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,920
I've got to rush too!

645
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,620
There's something that's been bothering me from the beginning.

646
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,120
The letters that are read by removing the letter "sa" and the blackmails.

647
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,020
The phantom of the Konpira moving around

648
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,620
just like the phantom in the Phantom of the Opera.

649
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,320
Everything that is happening seems to be unscrupulous

650
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,720
and deliberately attract the attention of others.

651
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,020
But the killing itself gives me a totally different impression.

652
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,220
That could be a clue to something.

653
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,220
So, this is the corner of the pedestal.

654
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,320
It's a great place for the killer to hide.

655
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,220
Dad! Please do something!

656
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,920
We've come this far...

657
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,020
At this rate, Tamanosuke's stage will be forever gone!

658
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,820
Don't worry about that!

659
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,120
I just got word from Officer Ohnishi a while ago.

660
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,520
Tamanosuke Ito has been acquitted.

661
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,220
But, on the other hand, Tatsuhiko Rausu

662
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,720
is being interrogated as a prime suspect.

663
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm sure that they're on the right track this time.

664
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,820
At the scene of the crime, the fingerprints of the victim

665
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,020
as well as that of Mr. Tatsuhiko Rausu were detected

666
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,420
on the cane used to climb up the stone steps.

667
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,020
They say that the fingerprints probably rubbed off

668
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,720
when he struggled with the victim.

669
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,120
Moreover, in his car, they found...

670
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,220
You gotta be kidding. I don't know of that cane!

671
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't remember putting something like that inside the trunk!

672
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,120
It seems that the phantom in question appeared at the showing yesterday

673
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,420
and that there was somewhat of a commotion.

674
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Although it seemed as if most of the audience

675
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,720
thought it was just a part of the show.

676
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,820
Isn't it then that you used the projector?

677
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,120
I see! So, that's how it was done...

678
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,320
You gotta be kidding!

679
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,220
Are you saying that I did that?

680
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,220
If you use a remote controller, you could've operated the projector

681
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,120
even from the audience where you were seated.

682
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Absurd.

683
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,820
And for the tape recorder and transmitter.

684
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:52,220
Was it Renge? You used these to make her hear the voice of the phantom.

685
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,520
And from the room backstage we confiscated the speaker.

686
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,520
You did all this to grasp her heart.

687
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,120
You wanted to set Tamanosuke up so that you could make her yours.

688
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,720
Isn't that right?

689
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,920
You gotta be joking!

690
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,020
Brother! Brother!

691
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,220
Sorry to have worried you.

692
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,520
Where's everybody?

693
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,820
They're at the hotel.

694
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,320
Let's go, we've got to decide what we're going to do about today's show.

695
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,420
Yep.

696
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,520
Conan, thank you.

697
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,520
The problem is the pedestal.

698
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,220
If the killer stabbed Mr. Nabeshima from up there...

699
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,840
That's right!

700
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,340
An alibi. I've got an alibi!

701
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,040
Too bad, but that also...

702
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,840
So you lied about practicing your voice at the vacant lot of the park?

703
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,840
"I was afraid that they would take my role away from me".

704
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,940
"I thought that maybe if I testified in Mr. Rausu's favor..."

705
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,140
So, that's what she said.

706
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,540
What?

707
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Why would she say something like that?

708
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,440
Huh, what's the matter?

709
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,540
I'm sorry, may I go to the restroom?

710
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,040
One more thing. The projector used to project the phantom.

711
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,840
If it's possible to move it using a remote controller from the audience,

712
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,040
the same could be done from elsewhere.

713
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,940
That's right! Like from above the stage!

714
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Officer.

715
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,140
You're Mr. Mouri's...

716
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,640
Pops Mouri told me to ask you.

717
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,840
Mr. Mouri has a question?

718
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,940
Where were Mr. Rausu's fingerprints on the cane?

719
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,440
On the tape.

720
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Tape?

721
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,140
Right, although the color and the way the tape

722
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,840
is wrapped around the cane differs depending on the shop.

723
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,440
Well, it's sort of like a guide.

724
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,240
Which shop did that cane belong to?

725
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,440
As to that, we haven't found a shop that carries that cane yet.

726
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,640
We thought we'd find it right away

727
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,440
because it's unusual to wrap the cane with luminous tape.

728
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,040
Luminous tape!

729
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,940
I got it! I know who's the real killer!

730
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,340
Tatsuhiko Rausu has fled!

731
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,740
What?

732
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,440
I'm sorry, it was just for a split second when I was off my guard.

733
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
After him right this minute, on the double!

734
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,340
You don't love me! You don't love me! You don't love me!

735
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,540
Let me go! Let me go!

736
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,340
But, you are destined to be with me forever.

737
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,140
You can never part from me!

738
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,840
The unscrupulousness is the same.

739
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,640
Why would the culprit go out of the way to let their whereabouts be known?

740
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,340
I've no choice but to go!

741
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,940
Conan!

742
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,540
Have you seen Renge?

743
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,040
Tamanosuke.

744
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,340
This is...

745
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,940
Don't tell me that Rausu got her...

746
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,540
There he is! I looked all over for you, Conan.

747
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
What's up, you two?

748
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,440
Renge, where are you?

749
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,640
Renge!

750
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Over there!

751
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,640
Rausu! Where's Renge?

752
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,040
Hold it, Rausu!

753
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,640
Let's die together, my beloved child!

754
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,740
Let's fall to the pit of darkness together!

755
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,440
Let me go! Let me go!

756
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,840
Hold it, Phantom!

757
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Let her go!

758
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,940
Renge!

759
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,040
Stop it!

760
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,140
Sonoko?

761
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,140
Phantom of the Konpira!

762
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,640
I already know that you are not Mr. Rausu!

763
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,540
I also know that your original purpose was not murder.

764
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,640
Isn't that right?

765
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,040
Stop all this, Romi!

766
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,240
-What? -No.

767
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,240
That's right. You were acting strange to begin with.

768
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,540
All of this was what you created and what you acted out.

769
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,740
You mean all that was an act? Why'd she do something like that?

770
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,440
Of course is to frame Mr. Rausu.

771
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,540
Romi, why?

772
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,540
To take revenge on his father.

773
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,740
You mean the former owner of Rausu Concieron who passed away.

774
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,240
That former owner overtook my father's business,

775
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,340
which lead to my father's illness that eventually killed him.

776
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,540
My mother died soon after as if to go after him.

777
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,940
What?

778
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,240
Being alone, the only thing I could do was to act!

779
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,940
Taking revenge didn't even cross my mind.

780
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,240
That's when I got this offer.

781
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,040
I felt as if my father and mother were shouting "now's the time".

782
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,440
That's why you accepted my offer.

783
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,740
But, I wasn't planning to kill anyone to begin with.

784
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,940
I was satisfied if I could spoil this show

785
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,440
and taint the name of the sponsor, Rausu Concieron.

786
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,640
That's why I pressured Renge.

787
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,840
I thought that she would never make it,

788
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,840
that she would spoil the entire show.

789
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,140
But, I made a big mistake.

790
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,440
It had slipped my mind, that Renge was also an actress.

791
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
If I were her,

792
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,140
I would've used the pressure to give me a boost.

793
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,240
Romi.

794
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,840
On top of that, the guy found out.

795
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,340
Now all my debts are gone.

796
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,840
Could this be a windfall from heaven?

797
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,040
An incomplete avenging of my parents' death would not be forgiven.

798
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,540
I felt as if I heard them say, "Kill this guy and frame the other guy

799
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,840
to make it look as if he did the killing"!

800
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,940
So, you called Mr. Nabeshima out to the vacant lot,

801
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,040
hid behind the monument and waited.

802
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,540
If the killer stabbed Mr. Nabeshima from on top the pedestal,

803
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,140
it had to be someone short.

804
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,840
So, I figured that if it were a woman,

805
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,240
it's possible that the knife would come right about

806
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,540
where Mr. Nabeshima's neck is.

807
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,740
The luminous tape that was on the cane

808
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,240
was the one that Mr. Rausu had accidentally touched.

809
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,340
The police would most naturally think that Tamanosuke

810
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,540
was put unconscious by Mr. Rausu who tried to take Renge away.

811
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,840
You then deliberately appeared before Mr. Rausu,

812
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,440
and schemed to change your testimony about him later

813
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,940
just so that you could give him a bad image.

814
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,640
Moreover, while he was waiting in the park for Tamanosuke,

815
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,640
you put the projector into the trunk of his car.

816
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,140
But, he found out after all.

817
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,440
Come on out! I know you did it!

818
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,340
I thought that I had no choice but to carry out what I did to the end.

819
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,740
Rausu, who flees from the police, kills himself as well as Renge.

820
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,840
But, even that young lady over there saw through everything.

821
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,640
No, Romi!

822
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,140
What a pitiful, unhappy person.

823
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,140
Shoots!

824
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,640
Tamanosuke!

825
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,840
Conan!

826
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,240
Romi, you took somebody else's life away,

827
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,440
and now you try to take your own life away.

828
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,240
Do you intend to blame what you just did on your parents too?

829
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,640
No matter what reason there may be,

830
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,940
you did what humans should never do.

831
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,040
You must make amends for what you did.

832
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,140
You aren't allowed to die!

833
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,440
Besides, you deliberately left the pamphlet of this place

834
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
in a conspicuous place like that

835
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,940
because you wanted someone to stop you,

836
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,440
from what you were about to do.

837
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,440
I'm glad, it's all thanks to you, Sonoko.

838
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,840
Did I do it again?

839
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,640
While you were sleeping, yes.

840
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,740
I'm sorry, I'm going to continue acting,

841
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,640
together with the troupe leader, all my life.

842
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,040
Renge.

843
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,340
Okay.

844
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,340
It's a lot of fun!

845
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,640
It requires quite a bit of strength.

846
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,840
It kind of feels good, though.

847
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,540
Never mind kneading the udon,

848
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,840
I really need a glass of beer. I need beer!

849
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,640
He's the same wherever he goes.

850
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,060
Next Conan's Hint:

851
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,280
"Premier ticket"
