1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,090
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,090
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,890
Today's mystery involves the Youth Detective League.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,190
The pictures a child draws hold the key to the case.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,100
Just as expected of you, this is a terrible picture, Genta.

9
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Hey, come on, talk for yourself, Mitsuhiko.

10
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Say what you like.

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,300
A man's value is not to be judged by the picture he draws.

12
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,800
You're right.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,300
But, people who can draw nicely are admirable

14
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,200
and I really respect them.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,300
I guess so...

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,900
Maybe I'll think of commuting to art class starting tomorrow.

17
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Count me in, too!

18
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,400
Really, I tell you.

19
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,100
"Jukichi Sakai (55)"

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,500
I wonder what he's doing?

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
What a weird man!

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
I smell a crime.

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
What?

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,000
-Money? -Talk about a large sum of money, too.

25
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Is that...

26
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,050
Hold it, mister!

27
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,150
Why do you have all that money?

28
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,350
Are you a thief?

29
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,150
No! I'm...

30
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,450
Get him!

31
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,750
Wait, you guys.

32
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,550
Let me go. The boy...

33
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,950
The boy will be killed.

34
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,650
What does it mean?

35
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,050
Just as I thought.

36
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,950
"The Kidnapper in the Picture"

37
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,950
"Kenzo Tsubakuro"

38
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,950
My hunch was right after all.

39
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,850
Right. It was a kidnap case.

40
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,350
The one who was kidnapped is...

41
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,350
"Kenzo Tsubakuro (70)" -Akio Tsubakuro, age 5,

42
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,550
the grandchild of Kenzo Tsubakuro,

43
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,950
the head of the Tsubakuro Financial Gro.

44
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,750
"Akio Tsubakuro (5)" -He likes to draw pictures.

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,350
And the bunch of bills

46
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,750
were ransom money for Akio who had been kidnapped.

47
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,750
All right, then. Mr. Tsubakuro, will you please explain the details?

48
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,350
Get out of here.

49
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,250
Mr. Tsubakuro.

50
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,550
What's this?

51
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,950
It's a picture that Akio drew,

52
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,050
that was sent here from the kidnapper.

53
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,650
When did you receive it?

54
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,950
About noon yesterday...

55
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,850
It was in the mailbox together with the blackmail.

56
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,750
I see.

57
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,750
And that's the blackmail.

58
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,750
"Price of your child, 10 billion yen. Clown."

59
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,650
Cool.

60
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,550
How many servings of eel over rice can you eat with that amount?

61
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,750
Come on, Genta!

62
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,450
But, the money we just saw a while ago,

63
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,350
was far from 10 billion yen.

64
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,950
That money was just to display

65
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,550
whether they really had the will to pay the ransom amount or not.

66
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm sure that the kidnapper back then was...

67
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,650
Right?

68
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,850
Yes, that's right.

69
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,750
Hey, I appreciate you reporting the case to the police,

70
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,750
but from here, we the police will take care of things.

71
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,450
So, go and hurry on home.

72
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,450
Inspector, you the police are also going home.

73
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,650
But, Mr. Tsubakuro...

74
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,750
Akio is my precious one and only grandson

75
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,850
that my son and his wife had left behind

76
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,350
after they died of a traffic accident last year.

77
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,150
If anything happens to him,

78
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,550
I wouldn't be able to face up to them.

79
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,050
I understand how you feel, Mr. Tsubakuro.

80
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,750
But the moment of contact with the kidnapper

81
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,150
when the ransom money is to be exchanged for the kidnapped

82
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,350
is the best time to arrest the kidnapper.

83
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,050
10 billion yen is quite heavy to carry,

84
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,150
therefore, the kidnapper...

85
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,550
No!

86
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,550
I don't care whether the kidnapper is caught or not.

87
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,750
I don't want to endanger Akio's life.

88
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,650
Besides, I have no intention to give the kidnapper the money.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,250
Just what do you mean?

90
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,750
This was in the mailbox this morning.

91
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,650
Account where the money is to be transferred

92
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,850
to Swiss Fontvelle Bank.

93
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,750
Swiss Bank?

94
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,850
Inspector, we'd better order stop payment

95
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,250
or ask the bank to tell us who the account belongs to.

96
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,350
It's no use.

97
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,750
Switzerland is a bank nation.

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,450
If things go that easily,

99
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,850
the existence of the banks in Switzerland would lose their meaning.

100
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,650
Oh, God.

101
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,550
I hate to say so.

102
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,250
But, it's just as the boy says.

103
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,850
No matter what the case, they are no exceptions.

104
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,750
But if by doing so, Akio is going to come back safe.

105
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,550
So, please. Leave!

106
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,650
Mr. Tsubakuro.

107
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,150
Then...

108
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,350
This is...

109
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,450
A perfect crime?

110
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,550
Inspector.

111
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,150
Don't tell me that you gave up on the investigation.

112
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,650
Of course.

113
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,050
As long as Mr. Tsubakuro wants it that way,

114
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,750
we can't involve ourselves in his paying the ransom.

115
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,350
However, being the police,

116
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,050
we can't let such a ruthless crime go unchecked.

117
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,550
Which means that as soon as the ransom is paid

118
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,850
and Akio is returned safely,

119
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,050
you're going to start an all-out investigation, right?

120
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,950
Exactly.

121
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,850
But, even if the ransom is paid,

122
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,350
there is no guarantee that Akio will return safely.

123
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,550
Akio really likes to draw, doesn't he?

124
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,050
This is...

125
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,750
What's up, Conan?

126
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,050
Conan?

127
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,250
Mr. Tsubakuro, will you please show me Akio's picture one more time?

128
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,950
Just as I thought, it's here too.

129
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,550
That's Akio's habit.

130
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,750
Habit?

131
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,250
When he draws a picture,

132
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,150
he draws whatever catches his attention as his signature.

133
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,350
Whatever catches his attention?

134
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,650
Come to think of it, I think I've seen the same thing somewhere before.

135
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Really? Where?

136
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,900
I wonder where it was?

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, that's right.

138
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,000
When I went to South Beika Kindergarten where Akio goes to,

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,200
I was shown a picture that he drew.

140
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,700
South Beika Kindergarten, I got it.

141
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Mr. Tsubakuro, please lend me this picture,

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,700
-I'll bring it right back. -Hey, sonny.

143
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,200
"South Beika Kindergarten"

144
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Excuse me!

145
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,000
Do you want anything, sonny?

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,200
I would like to have a look at the picture that Akio Tsubakuro had drawn.

147
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Akio's drawing?

148
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,800
The one that Akio's grandfather looked

149
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
as is probably this picture posted here.

150
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
There.

151
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
This is the one.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Teacher, where did Akio draw this picture?

153
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,600
No doubt about it.

154
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,700
That signature is the same as the one that Akio drew.

155
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,900
Moreover, the one that was sent over is what he drew in confinement.

156
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,100
Which means...

157
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,200
If I can figure out where this is,

158
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I'll be able to find where Akio is being confined.

159
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
But the problem is...

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Conan!

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Just what do you think you're doing, Conan?

162
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,700
It's not fair leaving us out, you know?

163
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,800
No, I didn't mean to...

164
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't play dumb with us.

165
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,600
I'll bet you're planning to rescue Akio all by yourself.

166
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
We'll help you out.

167
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,900
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,400
We're dealing with a kidnapper, you know.

169
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,700
We can never tell what kind of danger we may be encountering.

170
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,400
But still...

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Take a look at this picture, Akio looks so happy.

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes.

173
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,800
He's enjoying watching TV with the kidnapper and laughing.

174
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,500
-Yes. This is Kamen Yaiba, isn't it? -Yeah.

175
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,700
As far as this picture goes, it doesn't look like he's in any danger.

176
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,600
If we're going to rescue him, it's now.

177
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100
-Yes. -Yes.

178
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,300
Conan, that's what you were thinking too, right?

179
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
You guys...

180
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,000
Besides, this is a case that we brought attention to.

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,700
-Right. -Right.

182
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Okay.

183
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,800
But, only until we find the place he's confined in.

184
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
After that, we leave everything in the hands of the police!

185
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,400
His signature?

186
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,100
I see.

187
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,200
But, what is it he drew here?

188
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,800
A spaceman?

189
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Isn't this a chimney attached to some building?

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,100
No, I'm sure it's a spaceman!

191
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
What makes you think he can see a spaceman from here?

192
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,500
But, there's no chimney in the view from here either.

193
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,800
Well, that's true.

194
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,900
This is no time to be arguing!

195
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,300
It doesn't matter whether it's a chimney or a building.

196
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,200
Let's split up and look for the thing that looks like this signature.

197
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,850
Okay...

198
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,450
There it is!

199
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,550
Really, Ayumi?

200
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,650
Look, isn't that it?

201
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,650
It's a water supply tower.

202
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,650
-But... -It sort of looks like it.

203
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,250
But kind of doesn't look like it.

204
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,050
I'm sure that's it!

205
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,050
Really?

206
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,250
How can you be so sure?

207
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,850
Look.

208
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,350
What do you see in the foreground of that water supply tower?

209
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,950
It's a clock.

210
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,050
-A park? -Yeah.

211
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,350
So, what?

212
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,050
A park is not included in his signature.

213
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,250
Take a good look.

214
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,650
There's something that looks like eyeballs

215
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,750
in the middle of the signature, isn't there?

216
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,350
True.

217
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,950
Definitely.

218
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,750
How would you see if the water supply tower

219
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,450
and clock overlap on each other?

220
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,350
Right, the thing that looked like an eyeball on the signature

221
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,250
was that clock.

222
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,950
Which means that Akio is in the water supply tower?

223
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,450
No, he's at a place

224
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,850
where he sees the water supply tower and clock overlap.

225
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,950
I see.

226
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,050
Let's go to the water supply tower, then.

227
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,750
Maybe we can see where Akio is.

228
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,550
Okay, let's go!

229
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,410
How is it, Conan?

230
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,610
Yeah.

231
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,510
That place in the view over there is the park with the clock.

232
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,210
The eyeball of Akio's signature is drawn

233
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,110
so that it fits right into the center of the water supply tower.

234
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,710
In other words,

235
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,110
although there may be slight differences,

236
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,110
Akio is most likely confined somewhere within this range.

237
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,260
Talk about a lot of houses.

238
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,760
It's hard to tell from here, after all.

239
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,460
If we all split up and search,

240
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,260
I'm sure we'll find him in no time at all.

241
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,860
Okay. Let's give it a try.

242
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,160
Okay...

243
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,860
If you see any suspicious person or house,

244
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,760
use your badge and call immediately.

245
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,060
Don't ever attempt to go after the kidnapper alone

246
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,360
or even think of attempting to rescue Akio on your own.

247
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
How was it?

248
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
There were quite a few suspicious-looking places.

249
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,560
But there was nothing all that conclusive of any one of those places.

250
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
There are too many places yet,

251
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,260
to really narrow down the place of confinement.

252
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,060
Where's Ayumi?

253
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,260
Huh?

254
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,660
We were all supposed to meet at the park at 5 pm.

255
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,760
Yes. This is Ayumi.

256
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,060
Ayumi, where are you?

257
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,460
Conan.

258
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,660
I figured Akio might be hungry,

259
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,360
so I was shopping at a convenience store.

260
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,760
Come on!

261
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,210
It's way past the promised time, you know?

262
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,210
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,810
I'll be right there, so wait for me just a while more...

264
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,010
Huh?

265
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,310
A clown's mask.

266
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,810
Huh? What did you just say? I couldn't hear you too well.

267
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,510
Ayumi? Is anything wrong?

268
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,610
What's up, Ayumi?

269
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,710
I've found a suspicious-looking person.

270
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,310
A suspicious person?

271
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,210
The kidnapper?

272
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,510
I'm not sure yet, but the clown that Akio drew was wearing

273
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,910
a triangular hat with a star on it, and had green hair.

274
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,810
It was holding the remote controller with its left hand, wasn't it?

275
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,010
Wait a sec.

276
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,910
Yep, it's exactly as she says.

277
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,510
No doubt about it.

278
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,810
It means that the kidnapper is left-handed, right?

279
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,210
Ayumi, don't do anything rash. Listen to me, will you?

280
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,410
Oh, wait.

281
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,310
Ayumi?

282
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,110
I've found him.

283
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,510
I'm sure he's the one who kidnapped Akio.

284
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,210
I'm going to go after him.

285
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,410
Don't, Ayumi!

286
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,510
It's dangerous, Ayumi!

287
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,410
Answer us, Ayumi!

288
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,410
I'll be fine.

289
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,810
But, I don't want the kidnapper to find me out,

290
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,810
so I'll contact you all later, over.

291
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,810
She cut us off?

292
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,810
Ayumi.

293
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,210
Ayumi!

294
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,610
Darn it. How could she...

295
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,810
Hey, Conan.

296
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,010
How long are we going to wait here for Ayumi to get in touch with us?

297
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,210
If anything should ever happen to Ayumi, it's all our fault.

298
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,910
Oh, right.

299
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,410
Can't you track where Ayumi is with that glasses of yours?

300
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,110
Genta, I can't...

301
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,810
Dr. Agasa is fixing my tracking glasses for me now.

302
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,410
Sitting here doing nothing isn't going to get us anywhere.

303
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,110
-Let's go look one more time. -Look where?

304
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,910
It's better...

305
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,210
It's Ayumi!

306
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,310
Hello, Ayumi?

307
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,810
"Tohto Paint Factory"

308
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,810
Hi, sonny, I'll bet you're hungry?

309
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,710
I bought you some sandwiches. And crayons and drawing paper, too.

310
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,210
Thank you, Mr. Clown.

311
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,010
While you were out shopping, I drew a lot of pictures, Mr. Clown.

312
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,110
Oh, really? Good for you.

313
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,310
Who is it?

314
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,910
I...

315
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,810
Who are you?

316
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,110
Akio! You'll be all right now because we've all come to save you.

317
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,460
Who are you?

318
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,760
How did you come here?

319
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
Hold it!

320
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,360
That's it!

321
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Hey! Kidnapper!

322
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,160
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad are taking you on.

323
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,860
Give yourself in quietly.

324
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,960
That's right.

325
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,660
Darn it.

326
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,660
Come, kid.

327
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,460
Mitsuhiko, there he goes!

328
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,460
You're not getting away.

329
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,960
Conan!

330
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,660
We did it...

331
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,660
Akio!

332
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,260
Are you all right, Akio?

333
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm all right.

334
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,960
Akio. I'm so glad, really glad that you're safe!

335
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,060
We did it, didn't we, Conan?

336
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,160
Our strategy worked.

337
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,660
Yeah.

338
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,360
A great victory once again for the Youth Detective Squad!

339
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,960
After that, Inspector Megure and the other officers

340
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,760
who got our report came to the scene and arrested the kidnapper.

341
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,760
But, as for us...

342
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,460
You idiots!

343
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,660
Just as expected, we were bawled out by Inspector Megure.

344
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,960
Bye, bye, Ayumi!

345
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,260
Thank you, big brothers of the Youth Detective Squad!

346
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,760
Bye...

347
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,860
Let's hang out next time, Akio!

348
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,160
Bye!

349
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,060
He said thank you.

350
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,960
It sure feels good to be thanked.

351
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,360
Akio sure draws well after all.

352
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
Where? Let's take a look.

353
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
-Conan! -Conan!

354
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,160
What?

355
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,860
Wait up, Conan!

356
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,160
How dare you take the frosting and the cake again!

357
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,660
Seriously. How come things turn out this way?

358
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,920
Next Conan's Hint:

359
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,480
"Sunglasses"

360
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,480
-In the next episode. -I wonder what's going to happen

361
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,720
between Detectives Takagi and Sato?

362
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
It's not going to work out, no way.
