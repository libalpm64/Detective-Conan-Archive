1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:05,625
The sun is grand.

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:10,325
Let's fill our bodies up with its energy.

3
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:20,425
Don't tighten up

4
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:23,625
but let loose you mind and body.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,825
Right, Conan?

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,625
Yes.

7
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,125
Why do I have to yoga diet anyway?

8
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:34,425
Like the fog clears.

9
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,525
Let's see through love and crime as well.

10
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,425
I participated in a diet boarding class.

11
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:40,225
A scary battle among women occurs.

12
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:41,825
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,825
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:46,025
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,300
"Beware of Dieting"

16
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,100
"Yoga Diet Training Studio" -You're just great, Ran!

17
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,400
To win an invitation ticket to a yoga studio

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
that famous people come to!

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,300
Yeah, but you didn't have to bring me along too, did you?

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,900
Okay! I'm going to lose weight as much as I can

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,400
in one night two days!

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,300
Don't push yourself too much at once.

23
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,500
Because if you damage your body,

24
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,600
everything you do will be in vain.

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,000
This sure is a wonderful yoga studio.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,600
Uh, what does "Chandani" mean?

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,500
It means the light of the moon in Indian.

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,900
It's the same as your name, Tsukiko.

30
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Yes. My parents who previously managed a yoga studio like this,

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,500
named me Tsukiko in hopes that

32
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,100
I would be able to take in energy from nature

33
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,600
and be mentally and physically healthy.

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,700
Thanks to that concept,

35
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,000
I've come this far with the help of all of you here.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
I really appreciate it.

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,700
And the food we serve here also has a good reputation.

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,300
"Kaoru Iimori (29), Chef" -A plentiful but low calorie menu.

39
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,600
We grow all our organic vegetables here on our own!

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,500
And most important of all, the food is delicious!

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,100
Really?

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,800
"Atsuko Degawa (26)" -Just like the Chef,

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,300
the food was just showy and unsavory.

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,000
How dare...

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,100
Hot! What's with this?

46
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,900
I'll burn my tongue!

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,400
How dare you serve something like this?

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,900
Do you want to be fired again like you did at the previous restaurant?

49
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,700
Fired?

50
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Herb tea, unlike Japanese tea,

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,500
is to be made using boiling water, you see.

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Then, why didn't you warn me?

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll write up on the internet

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,800
that I got ruthless treatment here.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,100
If I do that,

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,900
the reputation here will take a great plunge, won't it?

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,000
That's...

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,300
Atsuko.

59
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,100
I don't think you should go that far.

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,700
You, an employee's daughter dare talk back to me?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,300
That's right!

62
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,600
Get down on your hands and knees and apologize.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,100
If you do, I don't mind forgiving you.

64
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,700
What the?

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm so very sorry.

66
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,000
Tsukiko.

67
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,700
I'd just like you to understand that

68
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,200
this is not a complaint, but rather a reasonable opinion.

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
No matter what happens,

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,200
let's think of how we can make our guests stay here comfortably.

71
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,900
Is she the daughter of the president of Degawa concierge?

72
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,900
I've heard before that

73
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,800
she's a complainer that's really tough to handle!

74
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Hello? How about it?

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,300
Did everything end well?

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,100
What? You lost the suit?

77
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Just what do you think you're doing?

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,700
How can you not win a suit that is filed against me?

79
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Huh? You want out of this case?

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,100
Fine!

81
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,200
Just don't think that you can work as a lawyer

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,100
like you've been up to now!

83
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,800
You'll pay for this!

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
Don't you ever bring that dog

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,000
anywhere near me from now on, understand?

86
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,600
Is Atsuko being sued for complaining against somebody?

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,300
Actually, there are a lot of other cases against her too.

89
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sure that she's having it tough inside.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's just let her be for now.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,300
It looks delicious!

93
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
You can say that again!

94
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,700
So, this is the buffet that Chandani takes pride in.

95
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,100
Please help yourself to whatever you like.

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,200
-Okay! -Okay!

97
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,500
Please keep to each of your set calorie intake.

98
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,400
And, also, please take your meals to your rooms and eat there.

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,500
We don't want you comparing your meals with others

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,400
and be stressed out because you're discontented with what you dish has.

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,200
It's not good for your body and mind.

102
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,000
This wrap was ripped!

103
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,900
Bring a new one right away!

104
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,700
She just as nasty as ever.

106
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
She could be bluffing courage, you know.

107
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900
Well, who cares.

108
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,200
Well, my intake is up to 600 calories, so...

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,900
Slightly pickled Queen of the Night.

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
This smells good!

111
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm having this!

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll try that, too!

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,500
Wait...

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
This dish has more inside, so I'm taking this!

115
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
The amount in all of the dishes is the same!

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
If so, there should be no problem

117
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,200
even if I change the dishes, is there?

118
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Thank you for waiting.

119
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,400
With my calorie intake, I can only eat one dish!

120
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,100
But, after all, you came here to go on a diet.

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh.

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,600
The moon is starting to show from between the clouds.

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,200
The moon has the powerful strength of purification!

124
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,700
It's good for beauty too,

125
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,000
so why don't we do yoga right now?

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Not me!

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,500
I don't want to eat cold food!

128
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, come now!

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,800
Even if your food gets cold,

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,700
you can warm it up in your room.

131
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
And if you do what you have to do,

132
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,100
we'll serve you these strawberries as a reward.

133
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
I guess I don't mind participating then.

134
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, everyone.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
After taking your meals to your room,

136
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,200
please gather in the yard immediately!

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Are you going out?

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,300
Yes. I'm going to the fields

139
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,500
to pick some vegetables for tomorrow's breakfast.

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
So, let's bathe in the light of the moon

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
everyone and feel purified and refreshed!

142
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,700
Atsuko?

143
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
I could never do this pose!

144
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,700
I quit, I quit!

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,900
Atsuko?

146
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,100
What, quit bugging me, all of you?

147
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm having my meal from now, so don't disturb me!

148
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,900
Right! I sweat a lot,

149
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,300
so wash it, okay?

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
Yasuko, are you all right?

151
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm just fine. Don't worry about me.

152
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,300
Hey, everyone.

153
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Is anything the matter?

154
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,600
No, it's really no big deal.

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,900
Okay, let's call Yasuko and go back to doing yoga.

156
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
What's that?

157
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,700
Yasuko?

158
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
-Thank you very much! -Thank you very much!

159
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,100
Neither Atsuko nor Yasuko came, did they?

160
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,200
Yasuko.

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Is anything wrong?

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,100
I went over to Atsuko's room just now to check things out,

163
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,700
but the door's locked

164
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,600
and she didn't answer the door.

165
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,400
That's of concerned.

166
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll go take a look,

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
so you all go have tea or something in the dining room.

168
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,700
Okay...

170
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
No!

171
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
What's the matter?

172
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:19,523
The victim is Atsuko Degawa, 26 years old.

173
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:24,123
The cause of death is potassium cyanide compound poisoning.

174
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:26,023
There seems to have been the same kind of poison

175
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:28,023
in the small dish on the table, too.

176
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:30,523
What is the estimated time of death?

177
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,723
Between the hours of 18:30-19:30.

178
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:36,023
That's during the 30 minutes

179
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:39,423
before Ms. Degawa returned from Yoga and was found.

180
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:42,323
Atsuko.

181
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:44,023
During the time her body was found,

182
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:47,523
the door and window were locked from the inside?

183
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:48,623
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:50,523
No doubt about it.

185
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:54,023
The room key was found in the pocket of the victim.

186
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:58,423
The spare key is in the safety box with a secret code lock to it.

187
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,823
Ms. Satoyama took it out

188
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:03,523
and brought it here to open the door of this room.

189
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,123
Suicide?

190
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:09,023
Atsuko was really shocked about losing the suit

191
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:11,323
that she was fighting over in court.

192
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,523
That's why...

193
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:15,523
What's this suit about?

194
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:18,523
She was a well-known filer of complaints.

195
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:19,923
Filer of complaints?

196
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:22,123
But she got sued over that,

197
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:24,923
and it seems several lawsuits had been filed against her.

198
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:28,723
She got a call from her lawyer in the afternoon

199
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:30,923
telling her that she lost the suit.

200
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,823
She stayed confined in her room all afternoon.

201
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:37,123
I'm sure she was depressed.

202
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,923
So, she committed suicide depressed over losing the suit.

203
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:44,923
Huh?

204
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:47,723
There's condensed milk on the strawberries.

205
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:48,923
True.

206
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:50,723
I guess she brought it in here without permission.

207
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:55,523
Isn't it strange that she forgot to eat her dessert?

208
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:57,023
Conan.

209
00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:00,123
People who are contemplating suicide aren't composed,

210
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,023
so things like this happen.

211
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:05,223
Suits were filed against Atsuko from many people.

212
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,123
She was also hated,

213
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:10,323
so grieving over all that she...

214
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,823
Come to think of it,

215
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:14,323
weren't you fired from the restaurant

216
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:17,623
that you were working at because of Atsuko's complaint?

217
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:20,623
Is that true, Ms. Iimori?

218
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,723
It's true, but...

219
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:26,223
I didn't put any poison inside!

220
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,523
Besides, the food is all self-service.

221
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:30,523
How would I know what dishes that broad would pick out

222
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:34,423
of the several dishes that are lined out on the table?

223
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,123
True.

224
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:40,623
Moreover, she snatched Ran's small dish away from her too.

225
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,023
Then, what were you doing

226
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,823
while Ms. Degawa went to put her meal in her room?

227
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,023
I went to the fields about a 10 minute walk from here

228
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:50,123
to pick vegetables for tomorrow's lunch!

229
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,723
After that, I was in the kitchen

230
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:53,823
right through making preparations for tomorrow!

231
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,623
That's right.

232
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:59,923
I saw her working in the kitchen right through from the yard.

233
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,523
See? It's not me!

234
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:05,123
It could be that you pretended to go to the field,

235
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:09,323
but actually went back secretly to insert the poison.

236
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:10,423
If I remember correctly,

237
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,323
you're also able to take the keys out of the safety box, no?

238
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:14,923
What?

239
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,323
Kaoru! Don't tell me that you...

240
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,823
Speak for yourself! Although you pretend to be her friend,

241
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:22,323
didn't you actually hate her?

242
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:24,923
-What? -We saw, you know!

243
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:28,923
That you were stepping on her wear in the laundry room!

244
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:31,723
Is that true?

245
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,423
-Yes. -Yes.

246
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:37,223
I was doing Yoga with all of you too, right?

247
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,423
After I quit part way,

248
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,823
I was in the laundry room right through.

249
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:43,523
But, after everybody went back to do yoga,

250
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:47,123
you could have secret returned to that broad's room, right?

251
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,723
You could've inserted the poison then.

252
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,723
I didn't do it!

253
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,623
By the way, how about you, Ms. Satoyama?

254
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:55,923
I was doing Yoga with everyone.

255
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:58,023
She was with us right through.

256
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:03,023
I'm sorry. I'll get him right away!

257
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:06,323
Hey, wait up, Cookie!

258
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,023
There, got you!

259
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,423
There, there... Good boy, stay still, will you?

260
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:17,123
-He must've been really scared. -Yep.

261
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:19,623
I'll go put this away.

262
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,423
Put away?

263
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,523
It's gone.

264
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,823
The thing that's supposed to be here.

265
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,523
There, there, you be good now.

266
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:44,123
I see! I've got it!

267
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,123
I've figured out the truth of this case!

268
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:50,823
Okay, then, please give us the details at the station.

269
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:52,423
Yes, sir.

270
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:07,623
Sonoko, don't tell me...

271
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,123
Yeah.

272
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:11,723
Things are going so sluggishly that it's making me sleepy.

273
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,723
What the...

274
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,623
I can afford to lose any more of my beauty sleep,

275
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:19,223
so I'll solve the case right here and now!

276
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:20,923
What?

277
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,623
First of all, Kaoru...

278
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:25,123
I don't think you're aware of it,

279
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:28,223
but that yellow stain on your shoulders...

280
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:31,723
That's pollen from the Night Queen, isn't it?

281
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:35,323
The Night Queen is a flower with a short life span

282
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:39,023
going from bud to full bloom in one night after which it dies.

283
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:42,223
The petals of this flower are also edible.

284
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:46,023
Slightly pickled Night Queen was on tonight's menu, wasn't it?

285
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:49,123
Therefore, you definitely went to the field

286
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,823
to look for the flower.

287
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,123
Conan says he definitely saw yellow powder

288
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:56,523
on your clothes after you came back

289
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,823
that wasn't there when you went out.

290
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:01,223
Yes, I remember!

291
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:04,223
And, Yasuko!

292
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,323
You're not the culprit either.

293
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,523
Let's assume that Yasuko did go to Atsuko's

294
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,123
and inserted poison,

295
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,723
it would've been impossible for her

296
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,223
to lock the room from the outside.

297
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,723
Because the key was in Atsuko's pocket

298
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,823
and the spare in the safety box.

299
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:23,323
In other words, it means that she committed suicide after all?

300
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:27,223
Why don't we let the deceased rest in peace already?

301
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:29,623
See, the moon is beautiful

302
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:31,523
as if to mourn over the dead.

303
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,523
No!

304
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:36,223
The moon is not there to mourn over the dead

305
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,623
but rather to shine light on the truth!

306
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:40,923
Tsukiko.

307
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:44,623
The truth is you were the one who murdered Atsuko!

308
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:49,623
Sonoko, just what are you...

309
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:51,323
Tsukiko.

310
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:53,623
You went out of your way

311
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,823
to lure Atsuko out to do Yoga under the moonlight,

312
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,823
because you needed to make her take her meal to her room first.

313
00:18:00,823 --> 00:18:02,923
Even if I were able to make her take her meal to her room,

314
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:06,123
I wouldn't have had the time to insert poison in her food.

315
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:08,623
You didn't have to

316
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:11,723
because the poison would've naturally made it into her food

317
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,023
because of Atsuko's certain behavior.

318
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:16,423
Just what do you mean?

319
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:18,723
Ran, think back at the time

320
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,023
we were worried and went up to her room.

321
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:24,323
What did she do?

322
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,323
Well...

323
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:29,623
I heard the bell of the microwave oven.

324
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:32,723
So, she could've been warming up her food.

325
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:34,923
Right! I'm sure that she covered her small dish

326
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,723
with Saran Wrap back then.

327
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:39,823
But, what's strange is,

328
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:43,123
I don't see a trace of the wrap that was used anywhere.

329
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,723
Come to think of it, there isn't.

330
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,623
But, what on earth does that have to do with?

331
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:50,023
I'm sure you've all experienced it at one time or another.

332
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,223
But when you warm something up after covering it with wrap,

333
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:55,323
steam turns into vapor droplets that stick to the wrap

334
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:57,923
and fall into the food in the dish.

335
00:18:57,923 --> 00:19:01,623
What if poison was smeared onto the wrap?

336
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,523
I see!

337
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:04,623
Tsukiko.

338
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,123
You smeared poison onto a wrap

339
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,823
with a certain amount of length beforehand,

340
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:12,623
dried it and wrapped it back onto the roll again.

341
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:13,723
Then all you had to do was create a situation

342
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:17,323
to get Atsuko to warm up her food using the microwave

343
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,323
no matter what dish she chose and poison her to death.

344
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:22,423
That's an interesting deduction,

345
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:26,623
but I gave her a new roll of wrap in front of everyone, didn't I?

346
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,623
So, how could I have put poison on it?

347
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:31,923
That's how you schemed it to begin with!

348
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,923
You wanted to show all of us in front of our eyes

349
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:38,123
that you changed the roll of wrap.

350
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:41,023
I cut the box open and gave it to her, you know.

351
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,223
I didn't rig it or anything!

352
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,523
As for the Saran Wrap box,

353
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:46,223
if you tear the box from the side,

354
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:47,223
you can easily take the roll of Saran Wrap out

355
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,023
without opening the box from the front.

356
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,523
I see.

357
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,623
See? Doing yoga in the moonlight

358
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,023
and exchanging the box of Saran Wrap

359
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:58,323
were all secretly schemed by you!

360
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,923
Do you have proof that I did it?

361
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:03,423
In the first place, the wrap with the poison on it

362
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:04,723
is nowhere in sight, is it?

363
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:08,923
Of course, because you hid it in a certain place.

364
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,223
Huh? Where on earth?

365
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,623
Tsukiko. Why did you bring Cookie

366
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:18,723
who you were told never to bring back to this room again over?

367
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:20,523
That's...

368
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:24,723
It's because you retrieved the used Saran Wrap with poison on it

369
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,123
and hid it in Cookie's pocket.

370
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:31,423
Officer Chiba, please check inside Cookie's pocket!

371
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:32,823
Okay.

372
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,723
I found it!

373
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:42,423
You deceived everyone saying that you were going to check on her,

374
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:44,223
went to her room.

375
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,023
Then when you did, you quickly put the little bottle in the room,

376
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,023
put the used Saran Wrap in a plastic bag

377
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,423
and hid it in Cookie's pocket.

378
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,923
But, for a dog with a keen sense of smell,

379
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,023
the smell of poison is intolerable

380
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:58,323
even if it is put in a plastic bag.

381
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,323
Cookie who got excited started running around

382
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:04,923
and you lost your chance to get rid of the wrap.

383
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:16,523
Yes. I'm the one who did it.

384
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:19,723
Tsukiko. Why?

385
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:23,823
The boarding house that my parents managed three years ago

386
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:26,623
went bankrupt because of that woman's complaint.

387
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:29,023
And because of that, my parents ended up with a tremendous amount of debt

388
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,623
and eventually committed suicide.

389
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,523
Oh, no.

390
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:36,323
Three years since the death of my parents,

391
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:41,323
I established Chandani with blood, sweat and tears.

392
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:44,123
A week ago,

393
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:47,423
that woman called to make reservations.

394
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:54,523
That woman didn't even remember me, and said...

395
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,123
I hear that the number of celebrities

396
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:58,123
going over to your place is increasing,

397
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:02,123
but if you can't satisfy me, I'll run you bankrupt.

398
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,823
I couldn't forgive her!

399
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,023
I wasn't going to let a woman like her

400
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:09,823
do what she wants to Chandani!

401
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:13,423
That's why I shut her up.

402
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:16,423
That mouth of hers that knew only how to complain...

403
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:18,323
I shut it up forever!

404
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:43,423
"Several days later" -It's delicious!

405
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,623
Just as expected of you, Ran!

406
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:48,123
You win a sweets buffet this time!

407
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:51,323
To exercise well, then enjoy eating!

408
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:53,423
Both are important!

409
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:55,523
Exactly!

410
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:58,523
Don't blame me if you end up with a super rebound of weight.

411
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,780
"Puffed grains candy machine"

413
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,200
The stage of the next episode is that popular program!

414
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,500
You mean TV? I'm going on air!

415
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,060
I don't think you should.
