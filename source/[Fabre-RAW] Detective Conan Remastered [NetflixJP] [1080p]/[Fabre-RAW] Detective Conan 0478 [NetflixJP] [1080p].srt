1
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,081
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:06,881
After the tears come live broadcasting.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,481
No anime has been this unique.

4
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:09,881
The incidents run in real time.

5
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:11,181
Keep an eye on the case.

6
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:12,581
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,181
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,181
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,391
Hi and howdy.

10
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:00,991
Here we are tonight again.

11
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:04,191
Every Monday at 7.30pm,

12
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,391
"Search and catch the girls, the Runaway Special"!

13
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:12,091
Tonight we are broadcasting live from down town Nengyoucho.

14
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,091
The Runaway Girls will run into the Nengyoucho...

15
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:20,291
Hanehacho and Kabutomicho.

16
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,491
If the three challengers can catch all three Runaway Girls

17
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:26,391
within 30 minutes of live broadcasting,

18
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,491
a prize of one million yen will be awarded.

19
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:30,391
Are you ready, girls?

20
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:33,191
Three, two, one, go!

21
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:39,391
"26 minutes left until one million yen"

22
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:46,391
Now, let's start searching and looking for them, guys.

23
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,191
There aren't many shoppers around.

24
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,491
Do they make money here?

25
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,291
That's why they need some of those things

26
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,491
to attract customers.

27
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,891
Look at that gigantic hourglass they put up there.

28
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,591
They want people come and meet in front of it.

29
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:09,391
Hum. A 30 minute hourglass. Fantastic.

30
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:11,891
How stupid of me. I should have made reservations.

31
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,891
They say it's full.

32
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,691
Okay, let's go somewhere else.

33
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,491
Oh, well. What shall I say, it's a...

34
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,191
I made an 8pm reservation already.

35
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:25,391
Hey. We have to wait 30 minutes then.

36
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,491
They say it's delicious there.

37
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,091
I expected a casual Italian dish,

38
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,991
not an extravagant cuisine.

39
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:35,491
Anyway, guys, we'll meet here a little before 8pm.

40
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:38,491
Until then, let's go our own way.

41
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:39,991
Let's break it up, guys.

42
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,091
Dad?

43
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,491
Sigh... I knew it.

44
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:48,991
What would you do, Conan?

45
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:52,491
They have a bookstore for mysteries upstairs.

46
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,191
I'll be looking for dresses.

47
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,291
Well, a little before 8pm, then.

48
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,591
Gotcha!

49
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,691
"Remodeling. Wet paint"

50
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:11,591
Sorry, the stairs are closed all day today!

51
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:14,491
Use the stairs over there, boy.

52
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:17,991
Sweet Chinese chestnuts! They are so delicious!

53
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,791
They are all natural Chestnuts. Yes, they are!

54
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:24,691
"Mystery Books"

55
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:41,491
"Real 30 Minutes"

56
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,891
That's right.

57
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,691
A man was stabbed on the second floor of the Yonehana Broad Mall.

58
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:57,191
Please come quickly.

59
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,191
He is still breathing.

60
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,591
He was stabbed from behind on the left side

61
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:09,891
and fell down forward.

62
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,891
So his face hit the floor hard.

63
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,891
If he was stabbed only a moment ago,

64
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,591
then chances are the culprit is still in this building.

65
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,991
Ha... Haibara?

66
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,591
You seem to be in love with criminal cases

67
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,791
or is it that the cases are calling you, Conan.

68
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,591
So, you're here too.

69
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:33,891
Over there, I was in that medical bookstore.

70
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,391
Then I heard a scream.

71
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,691
Did you see anyone suspicious?

72
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,591
Nope.

73
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,991
His fat wallet is intact,

74
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,891
so it's not a robbery.

75
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,691
What are you doing, guys?

76
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,991
Don't mess around. Go away.

77
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,791
And people, please step back.

78
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,091
The police is coming.

79
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,591
This way, officers! Beyond, on the second floor!

80
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,791
Dad!

81
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,291
Huh? Who's calling me, Dad?

82
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,491
What a...

83
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:22,691
"23 minutes left until one million yen" -Bingo! Piyo-chan's got caught!

84
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:25,891
You still have four more to go. Keep it up, guys!

85
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:29,691
We are the police.

86
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:33,191
Everybody, step back, please.

87
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,691
Inspector Megure has arrived in no time at all.

88
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:37,291
Yeah.

89
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,391
The victim's Yukio Nishiyama.

90
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,291
An ambulance will arrive soon, sir.

91
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,491
Okay.

92
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,991
She is Shiori Yamaguchi, she found the victim first.

93
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,591
She says she works a that shop over there.

94
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,891
"Movies"

95
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:53,491
And that is Mr. Koide, the manager of the cosmetics shop.

96
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:57,791
The police got the first call at 7.30pm.

97
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,591
Did you make the call?

98
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:03,191
What? Oh. Was it that time of day?

99
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:05,691
7.30pm?

100
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,991
I see.

101
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,891
Did either of you notice something, anything?

102
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:14,691
Well, let me tell you, Nishiyama and Miss Yamazaki

103
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,091
have not been getting along very well.

104
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,191
Nishiyama...

105
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:20,991
Did you know the victim?

106
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,491
Everybody in this Broad Mall knows him and hates him.

107
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,091
He kept annoying us by messing up things on display

108
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,891
and never tidies them up.

109
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,191
He breaks a lot in here as well and troubles them.

110
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:34,291
Every shop here have been harassed.

111
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,991
He is a real pain to us.

112
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:37,991
However...

113
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:44,491
Shiori here... I mean Miss Yamaguchi is an exception.

114
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,691
He hasn't done anything to her.

115
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:48,591
He calls her by her first name?

116
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,491
I guess they're quite intimate.

117
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,991
Why don't you give it to me straight?

118
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:54,291
You want to say I stabbed him, don't you?

119
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,591
I didn't say that.

120
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,391
Just what do you mean, Miss?

121
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:02,091
He holds a grudge against me because I dumped him.

122
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,991
And he keeps annoying me all the time.

123
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:07,091
What nonsense!

124
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:10,491
Everybody knew Nishiyama liked you.

125
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,591
That's why he didn't do any bad things at your shop.

126
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,491
You and Nishiyama were arguing just two days ago.

127
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:19,891
They say you two were talking so loud

128
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,291
that everybody in the Mall could hear you.

129
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,491
I heard you, too.

130
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,091
Why don't you talk about yourself?

131
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,291
Do you think I don't know?

132
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,491
Mr. Koide has been threatened by Nishiyama to pay money.

133
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,791
What?

134
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,791
It's not actually a threat...

135
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,191
It happened sometime ago. Mr. Koide hit Nishiyama.

136
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,891
In other words, you had to pay for compensation.

137
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,391
Stop talking about unnecessary things!

138
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,391
But...

139
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,891
Excuse me, please let me through.

140
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:52,491
I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri!

141
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,791
Now everybody need not worry about anything.

142
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,691
Conan.

143
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,491
Oh, Ran.

144
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:02,791
Hum...

145
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,191
Mr. Mouri, don't touch anything.

146
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,591
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,691
What's that bag he is carrying?

148
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,891
He got it at a pachinko parlor.

149
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:17,991
You shouldn't be wasting your luck on things like that, Pops.

150
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,091
And where were you at that time?

151
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,491
Hum...

152
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,891
Oh, no, dad...

153
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:31,591
"20 minutes left until one million yen" -Now, another girl's been caught.

154
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,791
"19 minutes left until one million yen" -Three more girls to go.

155
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,891
But the time limit is getting closer and closer.

156
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,391
Run, Girls. Run!

157
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:41,691
I heard the scream from the second floor.

158
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,891
And I came up quickly.

159
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:47,491
From the scene of the crime,

160
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,391
I can tell that not much time has passed

161
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,791
after Mr. Nishiyama was stabbed.

162
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,791
The other stairway was blocked.

163
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,691
That means the culprit...

164
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:58,891
had to go down these steps.

165
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,991
"Chinese Chestnuts" -Sweet chestnuts for you!

166
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,191
Hello, sir.

167
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:06,291
Oh, young man. You save if you buy a bag.

168
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,591
Sorry, I'm not a customer.

169
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,491
Oh, just as I thought.

170
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:12,991
You were here all this time, weren't you?

171
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,991
Right. I can't leave this stand,

172
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,691
so I can't go upstairs.

173
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,191
They say a man got stabbed?

174
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:23,591
Before you heard the scream,

175
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:26,091
did anyone come down the stairs?

176
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,291
Nobody.

177
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,791
And after that?

178
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,491
You're the first.

179
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:33,191
A few went upstairs, though.

180
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,191
Okay.

181
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:39,191
Alright, everybody. Get out quickly, please.

182
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,691
This place will be blocked off to the public.

183
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,291
No! Send everyone back upstairs!

184
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,991
What's the matter, Conan?

185
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:48,191
Nobody came down these stairs after the scream!

186
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,691
So the culprit may be still hiding upstairs!

187
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,991
I see. That's possible.

188
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,291
Hey, stop!

189
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,691
That's right! The culprit is inside this building!

190
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:07,491
I'm gonna catch him and I'm gonna make my day!

191
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,991
Cool down, Pops.

192
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,130
Let go of me, jerk!

193
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,530
Why did you run?

194
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,530
Why did you nab me?

195
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,330
This is an assault case,

196
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,130
so we have to keep you for a while.

197
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,130
Humph...

198
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,430
Make sure nobody enters into this building

199
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,830
and nobody goes out.

200
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,830
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,230
Huh?

202
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,830
This is a...

203
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,130
Why can't I go in?

204
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,730
We're investigating on an assault case.

205
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,930
-Shut up and move out of my way! -It's off limits until we complete...

206
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,130
That's enough. Lay off!

207
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,730
Shut up! Sensei can fire you if he wishes.

208
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,430
Wow. His sensei is such a big shot that he can fire a policeman.

209
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,030
Anyway, we are entering like always!

210
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,430
No! No one can enters!

211
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,930
This is Hasegawa, sir.

212
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,830
We are here to pick you up,

213
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,230
but the police won't let us in.

214
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,330
When you're finished, give us a call.

215
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,630
We'll be waiting outside for you.

216
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,130
Now three Runaway Girls' have been caught.

217
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,430
But the challengers are tired, too.

218
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,630
The only two remaining are Hinako and Lulu.

219
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,630
Run... run away.

220
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,030
Well, dining seems to be the last thing we can do for now.

221
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,130
Yeah, you're right.

222
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,330
So, this is Mr. Koide's shop.

223
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,430
I've got it.

224
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,230
Hey, you over there!

225
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,330
You've been shoplifting again at my place?

226
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,030
Don't start picking on me, man.

227
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,030
When did I ever do something like that?

228
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,730
Heck! You do it all the time. I know it.

229
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,530
Well, why don't you search my bag, then?

230
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,530
Go ahead!

231
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,230
Mr. Koide, may I have a minute with you?

232
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,630
Sure, sir.

233
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,930
What's with him...

234
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,030
Shoplifting is a crime, you know?

235
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,830
This will be my last time.

236
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,630
Catch one more and you get a million yen.

237
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,530
Can they make it in time?

238
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,630
What the heck.

239
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,030
You have seen the culprit, haven't you, Miss?

240
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,630
In that shop, they place lipsticks

241
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,930
in front of the glass case beside the aisle.

242
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,330
See, you an see them from here too.

243
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,730
If you shoplift a lipstick over there,

244
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,430
you can see the scene of the crime on the other side too.

245
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,030
Why... why are you saying something like that?

246
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,730
Because you have been acting strange all this time.

247
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,630
It's natural to leave right away after shoplifting, right?

248
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,430
But you stayed here, why?

249
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,230
Because you were afraid.

250
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,630
You feared that you could meet up

251
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,130
with the culprit outside the building.

252
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,430
That's what you thought.

253
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,430
So, you attempted to flee among the commotion, didn't you?

254
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,530
Sigh, you're a wonder.

255
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,430
I give up. How could you see through it all?

256
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,030
I am a detective.

257
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,330
Wow, you are great, indeed.

258
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,630
Well, what kind of a guy was the culprit?

259
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,230
Well, it happened so fast, I didn't have time to look at his face.

260
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,630
He turned back and looked towards me.

261
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,330
I was too scared to look.

262
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,430
The culprit is a man and left handed?

263
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,630
Yes. I'm sure the knife was in his left hand.

264
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,630
What else? Anything special about him?

265
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,030
Oh, yes. He was wearing a coat.

266
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,130
A coat?

267
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,530
A thin, long, black one.

268
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,830
Hmm... by the way, Miss...

269
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,530
About this...

270
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,930
Oh, I feel I'm freed.

271
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,930
I won't shoplift anymore,

272
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,930
so don't worry, my dear Mr. Detective.

273
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,930
Haibara! What's the matter?

274
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,030
I went to look upstairs.

275
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,530
The police are investigating, aren't they?

276
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,330
Yes. They were after the whereabouts of the murder weapon knife

277
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,930
and any suspicious person.

278
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,830
Upstairs there are only several offices...

279
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,430
And a dental clinic.

280
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,430
Then it was easy to check.

281
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,430
You can say so.

282
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,030
Any disposed black coat there?

283
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,530
-A coat? -The culprit was seen wearing one.

284
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,130
I didn't see any.

285
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,830
But I didn't look in men's room.

286
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,030
The police won't overlook it, I suppose.

287
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,230
I agree.

288
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,330
There seems to be no place for him to hide.

289
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,530
Why did the culprit stab that man?

290
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,130
That's the key point.

291
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,130
Unless one of the shop clerks or managers is the culprit,

292
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,930
it can't have been because of a grudge.

293
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,130
The wallet was intact, so it was not robbery, either.

294
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,530
If the culprit and the victim were fighting or struggling,

295
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,130
someone should have heard them.

296
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,430
But it doesn't look that way.

297
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,830
That means...

298
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,130
The purpose of the culprit was in stabbing itself.

299
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,530
You mean, not out of the grudge against the victim?

300
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,530
There were two people who called the police.

301
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,030
Two?

302
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,130
One is Mr. Koide.

303
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,330
The other one called the police before Mr. Koide did.

304
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,330
He was probably the man in the black coat.

305
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,130
The police got the first call at 7.30pm.

306
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,130
Did you make the call?

307
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,730
Yes. He made the call before he stabbed Mr. Nishiyama.

308
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,130
The culprit wanted the police to arrive here quickly.

309
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,130
But why?

310
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,430
That explains it.

311
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,830
What is it?

312
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,230
The two over there.

313
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,730
They're scary.

314
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,730
Suppose the culprit wanted to keep those two outside?

315
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,930
He wanted to make trouble and call the police

316
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,830
and have the police designate this place off limits,

317
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,330
so he called the police beforehand.

318
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,530
He had no other choice but to achieve a certain purpose.

319
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,130
What purpose?

320
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,330
That guy standing outside, when refused entry by the police officer

321
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,230
was talking to someone in this building.

322
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,230
When you're done, call me, sir.

323
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,030
We will be waiting outside.

324
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,930
Apparently he was leaving a message

325
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,930
on the answer phone of the person he called.

326
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,130
You mean, a person who is in this building but can't answer,

327
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,830
so has his phone on answer phone?

328
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,630
They came here to pick up that person.

329
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,830
The initial purpose of the culprit

330
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,630
was to prevent the two bodyguards from entering the building?

331
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,930
The real purpose of the culprit

332
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,130
was to assault the person who was to meet those two.

333
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,430
That person was probably...

334
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,030
undergoing dental treatment

335
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,130
and had his cell turned off.

336
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,430
Right.

337
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,630
So long as the culprit knew what time the appointment was,

338
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,830
he could manage to be there

339
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,030
and make the police off limit the area.

340
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,030
Good evening, do you have appointment?

341
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,330
Yes...

342
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,230
Haibara! Call the Inspector.

343
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,230
Okay.

344
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,230
What's the matter?

345
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,430
If you're an emergency patient, you'll have to wait your turn.

346
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,130
Huh... is there anyone else waiting his turn?

347
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,630
Yes, there's one person.

348
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,530
Hey... can you tell me which person?

349
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,530
Huh?

350
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,830
The person is among the three over there, right?

351
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,030
Yes...

352
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,530
The one in the middle.

353
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
Gosh!

354
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,330
Next person, please.

355
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,130
Who the heck are you?

356
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,930
I've come to avenge the death of my wife!

357
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,530
-What... -Drop death!

358
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,130
Go...

359
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,530
Is the culprit there?

360
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,730
It's that man!

361
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,730
Well done, all of you.

362
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,630
I'm Taizo Masuda, a congressman.

363
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,530
I was almost killed by that guy.

364
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,930
You're the one who hit and run and killed my wife!

365
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,930
What?

366
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,930
Despite doing what he did,

367
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,630
a scapegoat was sent to the police pleading guilty to the crime...

368
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,230
Just what nonsense you are talking about?

369
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,430
I've looked into it!

370
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,930
It took me three months to find a witness!

371
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,730
Why didn't you tell the police about it?

372
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,330
He's a politician and big shot, you can't win.

373
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,430
So I decided to do it myself!

374
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,130
That doesn't give you the right to commit a crime.

375
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,130
Cut it out!

376
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,730
That's right, you dirty criminal.

377
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,030
We'll hear you out as to the hit-and-run incident

378
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,530
at the Metropolitan Police!

379
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,930
That's the story.

380
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,630
Stop committing further crime.

381
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,930
Throw away your knife.

382
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,230
Two, one, zero!

383
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,730
Too bad, there was only one more person left to go, but it's time out.

384
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,630
Oh yeah! No million yen win this week.

385
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,430
Next week we will be broadcasting live from Beika-cho.

386
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,830
Bye now folks.

387
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,930
Dad will treat us to an Italian dish.

388
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,730
So come with us, Ai-chan.

389
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,030
Don't hesitate.

390
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,930
It may be once in a lifetime that Pops will treat us.

391
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,630
Oh, what's the matter, Dad?

392
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,730
No...

393
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,030
That restaurant was so crowded

394
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,330
that only the counter seats were open...

395
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,630
You don't say...

396
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,530
You couldn't make reservations...

397
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,930
I made the reservation, sure, but...

398
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,330
But what?

399
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,830
It was just for me alone.

400
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,830
What do you mean by that?

401
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,730
The lady at the reception desk was a real beauty

402
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,430
that I just couldn't decline...

403
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,230
Sorry, guys. But that's what happened.

404
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,930
And this if for you, Ran, dear.

405
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,630
You're not getting away with this trash of yours!

406
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,030
So sorry...

407
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,030
He does it a lot, huh?

408
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,330
This is the worst time ever.

409
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,730
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,330
Tatami and Window.

411
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,930
Tatami and window?

412
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,330
Are you afraid of Tatami?

413
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,430
Great.
