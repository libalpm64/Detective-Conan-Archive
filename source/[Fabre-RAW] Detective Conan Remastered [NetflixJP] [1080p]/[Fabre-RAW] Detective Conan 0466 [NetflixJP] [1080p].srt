1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:02,982
Snow White.

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:05,982
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:07,482
A group of four consisting of men and women.

4
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,782
The snowman of the Youth Detective Squad

5
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:10,382
watches the trails of the case.

6
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,782
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:13,282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:15,282
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:16,658
You're pretty good, Shinichi.

10
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:21,458
Yes, yes. You're so good.

11
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:30,858
"Unbreakable Snowman (Part 1)"

12
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:34,258
Huh? Where are they?

13
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:36,458
Look. They're over there.

14
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:43,958
Gosh, before we got here

15
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,858
they were dying for me to teach them how to snowboard.

16
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,358
And now they are absorbed in making a snowman.

17
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:52,658
By the way, are you sure it's okay?

18
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:56,558
The boy who said he witnessed Rena Mizunashi's motorbike accident.

19
00:02:56,558 --> 00:03:01,058
If the foreign lady that approached him was...

20
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:05,158
Yeah, she's probably one of the members of the Black Organization.

21
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,458
Vermouth.

22
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,958
What did you say?

23
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,658
Doesn't that mean...

24
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,558
Do you really understand?

25
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:19,058
If those guys find out that she was badly wounded in the accident...

26
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:22,458
Yeah. I'm sure they already know

27
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,958
that Rena Mizunashi was transported to the hospital in critical condition.

28
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,758
Hey, Shinichi.

29
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:31,258
But that's as far as they know.

30
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:34,058
They don't seem to know which hospital it is yet.

31
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:39,358
Besides, this case has already been reported to Ms. Jodie from the FBI.

32
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:43,658
I'm sure the FBI won't let them find the place that easily either.

33
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:47,458
But will that boy be okay?

34
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,958
It seems that he's under the custody of the FBI for now.

35
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:55,158
I think the organization is not interested in him anymore.

36
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:56,358
Because if they wanted to shut him up,

37
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:58,958
they would've done so when they got in contact with him.

38
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,058
But isn't it strange?

39
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:04,358
That the boy coincidentally happened to be at the house

40
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,058
where the murder was committed,

41
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:09,958
and you find out a mysterious woman approached him and asked questions.

42
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,358
-It was no coincidence. -Huh?

43
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,158
That's what bothered me

44
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,558
and made me search Rena Mizunashi on the internet.

45
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,858
I found a deeply buried info about her.

46
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,158
There's a big fan homepage dedicated to the announcer Rena Mizunashi.

47
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,858
Then it hit me.

48
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:28,058
There was a guy who was hired for that part-time job

49
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,958
and was the one causing the motorbike accident.

50
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:36,258
He seems to have been wearing custom-made jacket with her picture on it.

51
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:39,458
This is what was written in his diary,

52
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,258
"On my way back home from my part-time job,

53
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:46,258
a boy named Toji looked at my jacket

54
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:49,458
and said that the lady flew off her motorbike."

55
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,958
That's why that guy probably saw the diary, too.

56
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:53,958
That guy?

57
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,158
Yeah.

58
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:57,958
He mentioned that the homicide that happened at the boy's house

59
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,458
and the weird part-time job was connected.

60
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:07,258
He deliberately got Pops and me involved in the case by making us go there

61
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:11,058
and succeeded in making us encounter the boy.

62
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:13,958
That guy's name is Eisuke Hondo.

63
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,658
Eisuke Hondo?

64
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:19,058
The one who suddenly came to Ran's school as a new student.

65
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:22,858
Moreover, his eyes are identical to Rena Mizunashi.

66
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,658
Hey...

67
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,058
Don't tell me that the new student is...

68
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,258
He's probably a member of the guys who are checking on us

69
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:35,058
to figure out where Rena Mizunashi is.

70
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:36,958
That's what I'd like to say,

71
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,858
but somehow it's so unlike him.

72
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:40,958
Huh?

73
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,458
He seems naturally dense and awkward.

74
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,658
You idiot!

75
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:49,958
What if that's their plan to make you lower your guard?

76
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,558
But...

77
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:52,658
I saw him crying.

78
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,558
I've told you before about the case

79
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,358
involving the saw, nail and hammer, right?

80
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:05,558
Back then, I saw him crying.

81
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:08,558
I don't know if he was crying because he was having a hard time

82
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:11,758
solving the case and was angry at himself

83
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:15,358
or for not being able to get to the point of the matter.

84
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,158
Or that he was annoyed at himself for not being able

85
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:20,558
to relay what he wanted to, despite seeing through the case.

86
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:23,258
But I did see him crying back then.

87
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,758
It just looks like its crying!

88
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:30,458
Gosh, both of you!

89
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:34,058
But I guess this is okay the way it is. Right, Mitsuhiko?

90
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:37,958
Yes. I'm glad we bought fruits on the way here.

91
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:38,958
Yeah.

92
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,458
Hey, you brats! Don't you dare touch that!

93
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:48,058
"Sakuko Kokura (22)" -That's our graduation project, you know.

94
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,258
"Tanji Kiyama (22)" -Well, it's only a trial piece though.

95
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,458
It's a graduation project?

96
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,958
This snowman that looks like a monster?

97
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,258
That's right!

98
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:59,458
We're students of the sculpture department of an art university.

99
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,758
"Asaka Onoue (22)" -Since all four of us love snow,

100
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:05,358
we pleaded with our teacher and got special permission to do this.

101
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:09,058
But he's the only one who was making it.

102
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:12,958
"Kazuya Itabashi (22)" -That's because I make the overall framework.

103
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,358
After that, we will discuss it over and add what we want to on it.

104
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:17,758
After coming up with something that we are satisfied with,

105
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,158
we'll take a picture of it

106
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:22,958
and use it to help us make the real snow statue that we want to make.

107
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,858
If we make it all together from the start,

108
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,258
we'll most likely come up with something that's not really organized.

109
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:31,958
The title of this project is "The Grief of the Abominable Snowman".

110
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,158
The head's basically finished,

111
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,658
but I haven't come up with anything yet to his body.

112
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,058
Well, let's go easy on it.

113
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:42,358
Go easy?

114
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:45,158
We've got to leave the day after tomorrow.

115
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,658
So we need you to hurry and get it into shape somehow.

116
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:49,758
That's not nice, Sakuko.

117
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:52,858
Itabashi's been out here all this time for us.

118
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,558
I'd just like you to know,

119
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,158
it was you guys' idea for the four of us to make this project together.

120
00:07:58,158 --> 00:07:59,458
I didn't really care to.

121
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,458
Now, now.

122
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,558
It's our university project on our last winter vacation.

123
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:06,858
Right, let's end everything peacefully, okay?

124
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:10,958
I mean, we may not even see each other again after graduating.

125
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,058
Right, Asaka?

126
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,058
Right.

127
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,558
I guess so.

128
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:19,658
Shall all four of us go to ski at night on the last day then?

129
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:23,458
I guess not.

130
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,458
Not all of us can go.

131
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,058
Hey, Sakuko! Wait!

132
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,858
Asaka.

133
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,558
Don't worry about it.

134
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,358
I've worked things out inside of me.

135
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:40,058
Okay then, Itabashi.

136
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,858
I'm going back to the lodge.

137
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:43,558
Call me when you're done.

138
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:44,658
Yeah.

139
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,658
That brunette's leg...

140
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,358
She dragging her leg.

141
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:55,058
What a snobbish lady, the one with the slant eyes.

142
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:59,058
Shall we surprise them with our snowman?

143
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:00,558
Huh? How?

144
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:02,258
First of all, we...

145
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:33,058
Yes, this is Sakuko.

146
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:35,658
Huh? Talk with me?

147
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,758
Right now?

148
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:42,558
There's nothing better than curry

149
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:45,258
-after sweating in the snowy mountains. -That's right!

150
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:48,658
I mean, all you guys did was make a snowman.

151
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:49,858
Did you find her?

152
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:51,458
No.

153
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,958
Maybe she went out skiing alone

154
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,258
and because of this blizzard, she can't find her way back.

155
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,158
Hey, hey, Asaka.

156
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:03,158
Is something the matter?

157
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:05,158
You're the old man that was with the children a while ago.

158
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:09,658
Sakuko, who was with us, didn't come to lunch.

159
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:12,258
So I went to her room to call her, but she wasn't there.

160
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,258
We have already search the stores and all.

161
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:17,358
Don't tell me she really went outside?

162
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:20,158
Let's all split up and look for her.

163
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,858
We'll search behind the lodge.

164
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,258
You guys should search the front.

165
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,558
Hey! Sakuko!

166
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,358
Are you there?

167
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,858
Slant eyed lady, where are you?

168
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:37,758
Hey!

169
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,058
Guys, where are you?

170
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,458
Guys!

171
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:55,058
Silly, stop crying.

172
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:58,158
Hang on tight to my outfit and don't let go.

173
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,358
Hey, guys! Is everybody else nearby?

174
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:06,158
Yes! I'm hanging on tightly to Haibara's hand.

175
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:07,358
What's this?

176
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,758
It's my hand.

177
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:12,058
Are you talking about me?

178
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,758
In this white-out condition,

179
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,258
don't you think it's too dangerous to keep searching?

180
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:20,758
I guess so. We'd better wait till the blizzard subsides.

181
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,458
The head of our snowman is on the ground!

182
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,758
No!

183
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:34,258
It probably slipped off because of this strong wind.

184
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:36,858
The gloves.

185
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:38,058
Darn it!

186
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:39,358
Wait, Genta!

187
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:41,558
-That glove! -I'm sure there's a cliff over that side!

188
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:45,958
That was close...

189
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,058
I told you.

190
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:50,558
The blizzard is subsiding a bit.

191
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:51,658
Yes.

192
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:52,658
Huh?

193
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:56,358
Is something the matter, Conan?

194
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,858
Below the cliff in that lake,

195
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,158
there's something floating.

196
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,258
Don't tell me that it's...

197
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,258
Use the zoom function of your right lens.

198
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,358
Okay.

199
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:09,558
There!

200
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:10,558
It's a person.

201
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:12,658
A person is floating in the lake.

202
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:13,858
That's...

203
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:20,958
Sakuko?

204
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:31,025
The victim is Ms. Sakuko Kokura, age 22,

205
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,825
a senior at an art university.

206
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:36,825
It seems she drowned to death,

207
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:40,725
but shall we bring her in for autopsy just in case, Officer Yamamura?

208
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:43,625
Yeah. Please do that, will you?

209
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:46,625
Well?

210
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,225
Was this woman travelling alone?

211
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:50,625
No, well...

212
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,825
She came here with her classmates who went to the same art university.

213
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:57,125
From the right, it's Tanji Kiyama,

214
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,025
Asaka Onoue,

215
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:01,525
and Kazuya Itabashi.

216
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:05,125
So, did these three find the body?

217
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,125
No, the one who found her is...

218
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,125
We, the Youth Detective Squad!

219
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,325
We were looking for that lady when it became a blizzard.

220
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,825
Then we found her from that cliff over there.

221
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:20,325
We saw her floating in this lake.

222
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,025
You're that boy that's always with Mr. Mouri.

223
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,925
Which means that Detective Mouri is also here?

224
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,425
No, he's not.

225
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:28,525
I'm sorry, but we're the only one here.

226
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,525
Oh, I see.

227
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:34,025
Which means that the Sleeping Kogoro

228
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:38,025
won't be disclosing the truth of this cursed case.

229
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,525
Cursed?

230
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:40,625
Yes.

231
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:46,825
She's wearing snowboard boots.

232
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,725
On the lake, the snowboard was floating.

233
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:57,925
Moreover, to come down here below the cliff,

234
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,525
you have to cross that bridge.

235
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:04,025
And yet, that bridge was closed off till we arrived here.

236
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,225
It means that she fell from the cliff when she was snowboarding.

237
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,225
Yes.

238
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:10,725
She accidentally fell over the cliff in the blizzard.

239
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:18,325
It's natural to think she fell over the cliff and drowned in the lake.

240
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,525
But it's a complete mystery.

241
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,425
I mean, this lake!

242
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:24,825
Lake?

243
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,025
Don't you think it's weird?

244
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:29,825
There's so much snow accumulated and yet why isn't the lake frozen?

245
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:33,825
I'm sure that an evil creature that lives in the lake

246
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:37,025
lured her to jump into the lake and sucked her in.

247
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:38,425
It's a hot spring.

248
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,125
Huh?

249
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:44,725
Hot water flows into this lake and the water temperature is high.

250
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:48,725
Well, it's not the kind of temperature that anyone would like to go into.

251
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:53,025
I've heard that this lake has never frozen.

252
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,025
Is that so?

253
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,825
Yeah, it's written here in this guide book, too.

254
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:00,725
Shouldn't a local police officer know about this?

255
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,525
Then, it's an accident.

256
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:08,725
But still, I wonder if this person was really snowboarding?

257
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:09,925
Huh?

258
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:13,425
Because she isn't even wearing a cap or goggles.

259
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,925
That's right.

260
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,325
It was a blizzard,

261
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:19,725
so it's strange that she went without wearing anything on her head.

262
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:23,425
It probably came off when she fell into the lake.

263
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:26,225
That could be so for the cap and goggles,

264
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,625
but her gloves wouldn't come off, would they?

265
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,525
True.

266
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,825
Which means that Ms. Kokura...

267
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,925
was a person who perspired a lot.

268
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:39,425
Hey.

269
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:42,525
You know, it's like the people who hate to wear gloves

270
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,425
because their hands get all sweaty.

271
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:48,825
But I think even people like that would wear gloves when snowboarding.

272
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:52,225
Maybe she wasn't dressed to go snowboarding in the first place

273
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,125
and the boots were put on her?

274
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:59,625
Sakuko was murdered, but made it look like an accident while snowboarding.

275
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,125
Maybe somebody planned this out.

276
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,325
No way.

277
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:07,625
Then, you mean it was someone among the three?

278
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,425
I was just stating a possible assumption.

279
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,925
Would you give me the details as to what happened

280
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:19,425
up to the time Sakuko's body was found?

281
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,025
Yeah.

282
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:24,325
I think it was just before 12 pm, right?

283
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:28,825
Yeah. She went straight up to her room right after coming to the lodge.

284
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:34,925
After that, we promised to eat lunch together a little after 1 pm,

285
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,025
but only she didn't show up.

286
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:41,025
I went to her room and knocked on the door, but got no answer.

287
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:44,025
So I had the lodge manager open the door for me,

288
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:46,525
but she wasn't there.

289
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:50,525
We split up and looked for her inside the lodge, but couldn't find her.

290
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,625
And just when we were at a loss what to do...

291
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,325
I ran into them in the dining room.

292
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:57,925
Maybe she went out skiing alone

293
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:01,125
and because of this blizzard, she can't find her way back.

294
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,125
Hey, hey, Asaka.

295
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,025
Is something the matter?

296
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,125
You're the old man that was with the children a while ago.

297
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:13,625
Sakuko, who was with us, didn't come to lunch.

298
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,125
So I went to her room to call her, but she wasn't there.

299
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,025
We have already search the stores and all.

300
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,225
Don't tell me she really went outside?

301
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:24,025
Let's all split up and look for her.

302
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,725
We'll search behind the lodge.

303
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,025
You guys should search the front.

304
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:32,225
So we split in two groups and started searching.

305
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:37,225
Then, Conan found her dead body from on top of the cliff.

306
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,125
And?

307
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,125
Where were you guys from the time you parted with her

308
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,125
till the time she was found?

309
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,225
I was in my room at the lodge.

310
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:51,525
I was also in my room.

311
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:55,025
I was in the back of the lodge making the snowman.

312
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:56,425
Snowman?

313
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,625
Yes.

314
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:01,025
I was making the trial framework for our graduation project.

315
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:05,925
By the way, it seems like Sakuko has rented a snowboard and boots,

316
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,625
but did you rent something, too?

317
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,225
Yes. I rented a snowboard, too.

318
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:13,425
I rented a pair of skis too, but...

319
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,425
But?

320
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,125
Kiyama hasn't skied,

321
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,725
out of consideration for me, who hurt my leg last year

322
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,625
and can't ski anymore.

323
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:26,225
But even if you can't ski, you can still push a person from behind,

324
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,225
can't you?

325
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,425
Huh?

326
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:32,525
Look. You three could've called Sakuko after parting with her

327
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,325
to secretly have her come to that cliff there.

328
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:42,225
I just thought that all you'd have to do is give her a little push

329
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,725
and she'd go falling down into the lake below.

330
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,525
No way.

331
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,525
It's understandable if she fell over on a speeding snowboard.

332
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:55,125
But even if you were to push her from the cliff over there,

333
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,325
she would have landed right about there.

334
00:18:57,325 --> 00:19:00,325
There's still more than five meters before she reaches the lake.

335
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:05,125
I see. So pushing her off is out.

336
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,325
But if it's you who can ski...

337
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:14,125
I think that's impossible, too.

338
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,225
Even if he were to somehow make it down,

339
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:18,125
it would be impossible for him

340
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,225
to make it back up in that blizzard in such a short time.

341
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,925
Even with a rope.

342
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:25,725
If you still suspect me,

343
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:27,125
why don't you go to the locker in the lodge

344
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,825
and check the ski board and ski shoes that I rented.

345
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,125
If I used them, they should be wet, right?

346
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,725
Are you three using the same locker?

347
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,525
Yes.

348
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,525
Which means, anyone of you

349
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,725
could've taken out her snowboard and boots at any time you wanted?

350
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,225
Just what are you getting at?

351
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,325
-Huh? -Huh?

352
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:52,625
In other words, if you tie her on to the snowboard

353
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,225
and make her slide from the cliff...

354
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,525
she would automatically fall into the lake.

355
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,725
Are you all right, officer?

356
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,425
This slope is super bumpy.

357
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,925
If you do something like that, she's bound to flip over.

358
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:13,525
As to that, if it's Mr. Itabashi who can snowboard,

359
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,525
he could easily choose a slope that isn't bumpy.

360
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:20,325
Then, where's the rope that she was tied onto with?

361
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:23,225
That's right!

362
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,825
And even if she didn't fell down,

363
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,325
I think her body would've been tied onto the board.

364
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:32,825
Besides, Sakuko probably didn't have her gloves on

365
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:35,825
because she got lost in the blizzard

366
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:39,725
and was trying to call us on her cell phone for help.

367
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:44,225
But would she take off the gloves from both hands to make the call?

368
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:47,725
Maybe she wasn't trying to call, but trying to send a text message?

369
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,925
She would be using both hands to type.

370
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,425
Text message?

371
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,225
Yes.

372
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:56,925
Sakuko used to always confirm by text message

373
00:20:56,925 --> 00:21:02,525
whether we would be able to answer her call, saying, "May I call you now?"

374
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:07,125
Her gloves probably got blown away by the wind when she was typing.

375
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,925
She probably went after her gloves using the snowboard.

376
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,225
And fell over the cliff.

377
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,525
Was the blizzard that bad?

378
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,625
Yeah, it was unreal.

379
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,225
It was white all over and you couldn't see anything around.

380
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,625
Guys, where are you?

381
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,025
So it's an accident after all.

382
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:44,325
I guess so.

383
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:48,125
Please cut out all your strange guesses, officer.

384
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:52,725
Well then, let's go to the cliff where she is thought to have fallen from.

385
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:55,825
There may be traces of an accident left, too.

386
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,325
Accident?

387
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,025
It can't be.

388
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:02,525
I wonder if a person who promised to have meals with others in an hour

389
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,425
would go out into the blizzard, carry the snowboard

390
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:07,125
and go all the way up the ski trail?

391
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:12,325
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

392
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:13,525
I can't figure out...

393
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,325
how Sakuko who was in the lodge...

394
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:26,225
was thrown into the lake.

395
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,425
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:51,225
"The taste of snow"

397
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,425
What does snow taste like?

398
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:53,725
It's pretty salty.

399
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,425
Yes, yes.
