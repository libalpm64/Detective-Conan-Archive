1
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,334
Giant Gomera's "Treacher"!

2
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,134
Sure was good, wasn't it?

3
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:42,134
Yep! Gomera was super awesome!

4
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,334
Just a while more and the Kokkaigijidon (Diet) building

5
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:46,334
would've been squashed slim!

6
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:49,434
It's called Kokkaigijido, not "don".

7
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:50,834
I mean,

8
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,434
they were saying the one they played the other day was going to be final.

9
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,534
Gomera really keeps going, doesn't it?

10
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:59,234
I hear that they'll be playing the "Revolution" in six months.

11
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:02,034
Well, I'd like to see it, if you ask me, though.

12
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,934
Okay, then. We'll eat lunch at a family restaurant and...

13
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,334
Where are the children?

14
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,434
They were here till just a while ago.

15
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,534
Hey! What're you guys doing?

16
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,634
Conan, come and look!

17
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,934
Fantastic!

18
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:28,634
Wow! There are a load of boxes of plastic models and figurines.

19
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:31,934
There's a figure of Sprite Emera of Gomera too!

20
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:34,234
It's the car of some freak for sure!

21
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,834
-You're right. -Amazing.

22
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:40,334
There are scratch marks around the keyhole.

23
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,534
Don't tell me that...

24
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:44,434
A car thief?

25
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,834
Conan?

26
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,534
What's with the smell of paint thinner?

27
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:52,734
Where is it?

28
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:53,934
This smell...

29
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:55,134
Where's it coming from?

30
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,034
"Die" -This is...

31
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,734
If all cases were men,

32
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,434
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

33
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,234
That police detective officer's love suddenly accelerates

34
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:26,134
during a joint investigation of car thefts.

35
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,734
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,634
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,934
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:56,811 --> 00:04:00,111
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 1)".

39
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,811
Huh? What's going on?

40
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,511
I wonder what happened.

41
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:11,611
"Die" -What the...

42
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:12,711
This is...

43
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,311
My God!

44
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,211
Who are these brats?

45
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:19,311
What right do you have riding other people's cars?

46
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,411
I... I'm sorry!

47
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,211
Car thief!

48
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:27,411
The word "Die" is written with red spray on the ceiling!

49
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:30,511
Hey, hey, this is the police detective's car.

50
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:31,911
Police detective?

51
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,211
Huh?

52
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,211
Conan?

53
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,611
Officer Chiba?

54
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,211
You mean this freak's car is yours, Chiba?

55
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,711
Freak?

56
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:43,411
Because we saw loads of boxes of figurine

57
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,711
lined up through the rear window.

58
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:49,611
So, you came back to the car saying that you forgot something,

59
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:52,211
just so you could take all this out of the bag and line them up?

60
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,711
Sorry. I went out of my way to buy them,

61
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,611
so I wanted to show them off.

62
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,311
But "Die" on the ceiling is not comfortable.

63
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:06,011
Don't tell me it's someone who hates the police.

64
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,211
Maybe the culprit hates Officer Chiba?

65
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:12,411
Because it doesn't look like an officer's car anyway.

66
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,911
At any rate,

67
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,311
I guess I'll contact Yumi of the Department of Transportation.

68
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:22,211
What? There've been three incidents today already?

69
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,411
A car thief using the same method?

70
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,711
Yes, you're the fourth victim, Officer Chiba.

71
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:31,011
Entitled, the Oil-Based Red Swoosh Spray!

72
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,111
Oil based red swoosh?

73
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:37,211
Because it's swooshed with oil-based spray paint?

74
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,911
I tell you, you become target because you're an officer

75
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,611
and yet you go on a shopping spree for things like these with your friend.

76
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,111
I just came to keep him company shopping

77
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,511
because it's my day off today.

78
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:51,011
But, you like things like these too, don't you?

79
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,811
I won't deny it, but...

80
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:59,511
See, even our newcomer is laughing at you.

81
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,911
I... I'm sorry!

82
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:06,211
Really, you haven't changed, Officer Chiba.

83
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:10,711
Hey, doesn't that officer look familiar?

84
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,911
Really?

85
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:16,311
But Yumi called her new-comer,

86
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,911
so I think she newly came to the Metropolitan Police Department.

87
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,211
Masked Baiya.

88
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,511
Baiya?

89
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,011
This is the title of the SFX drama that Officer Chiba filmed

90
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,611
when he was in grade school, right?

91
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:32,711
It was playing at the end of the video, no?

92
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,611
Thank you, Masked Baiya!

93
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:38,111
Right!

94
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,611
Twin tale!

95
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,311
She's Officer Chiba's first love, right?

96
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,811
But Chiba said he was brushed off, no?

97
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,011
Right.

98
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,311
Something about she finally got together with someone she loved

99
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:56,911
and didn't even come to the class reunion.

100
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:59,211
I wonder if she got married or something.

101
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,311
No, judging from the looks of it,

102
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:04,111
it seems that she's saying that

103
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:07,211
she was able to become a police officer just like him.

104
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,211
And, the reason why she didn't come to the class reunion was because

105
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:13,511
she thought that Officer Chiba had forgotten about her.

106
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:17,711
You mean, Officer Chiba mistakenly thought that he was brushed off?

107
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:21,311
Yeah. Moreover, it seems that he doesn't even realized

108
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:23,811
that the person in front of him

109
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,311
is his first love, Naeko Miike either.

110
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:31,311
My God, I wonder why all the police officers around us,

111
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,011
that is, Officer Takagi and Inspector Shiratori too

112
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,511
all mature so slowly and are dense as well.

113
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:38,711
They're always in need of help and are super idiots.

114
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:41,611
Well, maybe they're busy investigating

115
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:45,011
and can't be bothered with things like that.

116
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,111
You think so?

117
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,411
How should I know? Don't ask me.

118
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,811
I guess we shouldn't say much anymore.

119
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:54,211
Either she tells the truth,

120
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:58,511
or we just wait till Officer Chiba remembers her.

121
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,611
Then, you're sure that nothing was stolen?

122
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,811
No, nothing in particular.

123
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:06,111
-Right? -Yes.

124
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:10,111
Which means that the possibility of some freak being targeted

125
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,411
cannot be ignored yet.

126
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,511
What?

127
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:15,511
Only the cars of freaks are being attacked?

128
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:19,511
Please show him the picture of the first car that was victimized.

129
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:20,511
Yes!

130
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:23,611
This is the car.

131
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,411
An Ita car.

132
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:26,711
It's really well-drawn.

133
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:30,911
Yeah. It's Emo-chan of Maho JK 48!

134
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,411
Huh? What of this car is Italian?

135
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,611
It's a Japanese car, no matter how you look at it, isn't it?

136
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:39,011
No, not that Italian (Ita) car.

137
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,411
It's an "Itai" (ouch) car, that's why it's called Ita car!

138
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,111
Since the Moe character is printed on the car,

139
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:47,011
the general public who sees this think it hurts,

140
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,211
therefore, it's called Ita car, right?

141
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:50,511
Yeah.

142
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,611
Are the other cars that were attacked all Ita cars?

143
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,011
Well, not really.

144
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,911
The car beyond in the picture hasn't been attacked.

145
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,411
And...

146
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:05,111
what about the first and second cars that were attacked?

147
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,211
Yes!

148
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,011
The car of a salaried man on his way back from golf

149
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:12,711
and a flashy remodeled hot rod owned by a hot rodder.

150
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,511
I wonder of it's the work of a person

151
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,411
attacking cars at random, just for fun?

152
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:20,711
But, judging from the word "Die" written on the ceiling,

153
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:24,911
it looks as if the victims may have something in common.

154
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:28,511
This is the picture of the three victims.

155
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:30,311
Do they look familiar?

156
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,611
I wonder...

157
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,911
If so, why don't you go help with

158
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:36,611
the investigation of the car burglars too, Officer Chiba?

159
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,211
Who? Me?

160
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:42,811
You may remember something important while investigating.

161
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,311
Besides, we'll help you too!

162
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:46,911
Right.

163
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:49,611
I mean, Officer Chiba, you're off duty and have a load of time.

164
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:51,111
It's not that I don't have anything to do, you know.

165
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,011
Hey, are similar car burglaries

166
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,011
all happening in this area?

167
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,211
Yes.

168
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,711
I think all of them happened in the parking area within Beika-cho.

169
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:03,011
Then, we'll go with Yumi

170
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:06,711
to check out the parking areas on the west side and ask questions,

171
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,611
so Officer Chiba, you go with that woman officer

172
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,911
and check out the parking areas to the east.

173
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,111
I mean, well...

174
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,011
Okay, okay, then off we go and get out of here!

175
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:17,011
This way, this way.

176
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:19,611
So, what shall I do?

177
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,011
Well, Officer Chiba won't be able to use his car for a while anyway

178
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:25,411
since the forensics are checking it now.

179
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,611
Just go on and walk home.

180
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:29,611
Okay.

181
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:39,511
Hey, why are we tailing those two?

182
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:43,111
Weren't we going to check out the parking areas in the west side?

183
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,811
Be quiet. They'll notice if you talk so loud!

184
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,411
You may be from the police,

185
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:49,911
but you're really a bit off, aren't you?

186
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:52,111
You see...

187
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,211
They're going inside the building!

188
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,511
It's the basement parking of the department store.

189
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,411
What shall we do? Should we go after them?

190
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,611
How stupid.

191
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,611
If they go in through the same entrance,

192
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,711
it's inevitable that they could run into each other inside.

193
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:04,811
We've no choice,

194
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,611
let's go into the parking lot from inside the department store.

195
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:13,511
Doc, watch the cars that go in and out of here, okay?

196
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:14,511
Hey.

197
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,911
Really, this is just too much.

198
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,711
Nobody's here.

199
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,911
I wonder if they already left.

200
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:28,411
No, there's nothing yet from Doc,

201
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,511
so I think they should be somewhere in this parking lot yet.

202
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:33,211
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

203
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:35,411
"Noriko Shigei (36), Housewife" -This is not a playground, you know?

204
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,811
If you're going to play hide-and-seek, do so in the park!

205
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:41,511
A car could suddenly move and you could get run over, you know!

206
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:42,711
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:45,011
What elementary do you go to?

208
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,711
And, your names?

209
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,711
-Well... -Come, come now.

210
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:52,011
"Akitoshi Fukuchi (41), Office worker" -It's just hide-and-seek.

211
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,611
I've got a daughter their age too.

212
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,211
They're going through a playful age.

213
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:58,911
Children go through dangerous experiences

214
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:01,111
because the parents are the way you are!

215
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,211
Hey.

216
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:06,711
"Takero Nawa (22), Free-lancer" -What're you guys doing near my car?

217
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:09,311
Don't you go touching it with your dirty hands!

218
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,311
Get lost!

219
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,611
Here it is, your cell phone.

220
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,511
I'll take it to you now.

221
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,711
What a hot rod.

222
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:22,611
Let's go out from here.

223
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,311
I think it's wiser to wait here with Dr. Agasa

224
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,511
until the two come out of here.

225
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:32,011
But, they sure are late.

226
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:36,611
It's been 30 minutes already since you've come back here and yet.

227
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:42,011
Maybe Officer Chiba remembered who the woman officer was?

228
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,311
I see.

229
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:46,111
They're getting carried away being lovey-dovey, maybe?

230
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:50,111
I'd have like to see Officer Chiba blushing in surprise!

231
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,811
What was that sound just now?

232
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:56,811
It sounds like a crash.

233
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:58,211
Could it be the parking lot?

234
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:08,211
Smoke?

235
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:11,311
Are you all right?

236
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:12,811
Officer Chiba!

237
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:14,311
What happened?

238
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:15,811
I wonder.

239
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,611
I heard a loud sound so I ran over here

240
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,411
and found him lying on the ground.

241
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:22,311
It seems he was hit from behind.

242
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:28,011
"Die"

243
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:31,711
Is this a car thief?

244
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,309
Hey, Conan.

245
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,209
What happened to what anyway?

246
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,109
I don't know the details yet.

247
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,309
Huh?

248
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:47,309
This man is the kind man

249
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,609
that stood up for us a while ago, right?

250
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,209
He's coming to!

251
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,009
Are you all right?

252
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,809
Can you tell us what happened?

253
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:58,909
Yes.

254
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,909
I came to this department store

255
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,709
to buy my daughter a doll that she asked for,

256
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,309
but it was sold out.

257
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,109
But I was hit from behind

258
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:13,009
just as I was about to leave to go elsewhere to look for it.

259
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,809
I got off the car to complain,

260
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,709
but I felt faint and lost consciousness.

261
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:26,009
I think that I hit my head somewhere when I was hit from behind.

262
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,809
Hey, what the hell's going on?

263
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:32,609
My friend's saying that he can't get inside the parking lot!

264
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:35,309
This parking lot's closed off for now.

265
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,009
Huh? Why'd you do something like that?

266
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,409
It's just a mere accident no matter how you look at it!

267
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:42,509
The one who's to blame is one of the two drivers

268
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,409
who was driving the car that crashed, right?

269
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,909
But nobody was in the driver's seat that crashed from behind.

270
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:51,809
Hey, what's going on?

271
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,509
I came back to get my wallet,

272
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:56,509
and why's my car emitting smoke?

273
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,209
So, it's your car?

274
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,509
Yes! It's a new car that I just bought last year!

275
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,409
Who on earth did something like this?

276
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,309
Wait.

277
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,409
Hey! Even the airbag is out?

278
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,109
No, no! Don't touch the car yet!

279
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,709
I see, that's the story.

280
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,209
So, Officer Chiba and the new-comer

281
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,909
were investigating the car theft in this parking lot.

282
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,709
But, they heard a loud sound and ran over to check on it.

283
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,409
Then, they found Mr. Fukuchi over there lying on the ground

284
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:30,909
after being hit from behind.

285
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,809
However, nobody was in the car

286
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:35,209
that crashed from behind already at that time.

287
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,609
But, the word "Die" that the car thief always left behind

288
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:43,609
was written on the windshield with red spray paint.

289
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,309
But is it true that somebody you don't know drove your car?

290
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:50,409
It's true that there are scratch marks by the keyhole

291
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,709
showing that the door had been forced opened.

292
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:57,009
The car key is still stuck in the key cylinder.

293
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,309
That's probably

294
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,509
the spare key that I had hidden

295
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:02,509
between the sun visor above the driver's seat.

296
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:05,309
It's because you hide it in a place like that.

297
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,409
That and the underside of the bumper

298
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,409
are the first places car thieves check.

299
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,209
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

300
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,409
Well, no...

301
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,809
I saw it in a movie!

302
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,709
And? You didn't see the driver of the car who hit you?

303
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,409
No, because I lost consciousness

304
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,509
as soon as I got out of the car.

305
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,009
It would've been good if the surveillance camera here

306
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:30,609
caught the culprit on the monitor, but...

307
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:33,309
It seems to have been going through maintenance just then.

308
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,109
No need to worry.

309
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:37,209
Right after we rushed over here,

310
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,909
we notified the police and told them not to let anyone

311
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:43,109
into this parking lot from inside the department store.

312
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,509
Moreover, Agasa and Ai are on guard checking

313
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,109
to see if anyone goes out from here to the corridor too.

314
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,809
I think the car thief...

315
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,009
is still inside this parking lot!

316
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,709
Right, Ai?

317
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,609
Right. No one has come out from the parking lot.

318
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:04,409
Of course no one has gone in either!

319
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:05,709
I see!

320
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,809
In other words, if we the police who are investigating this parking lot,

321
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,609
can't come up with anyone...

322
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,509
the culprit is among the three of you here!

323
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,209
The three of us?

324
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,909
I'm a victim who was hit from behind by the culprit, you know.

325
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,909
I'm a victim whose car was messed up by the culprit too, you know!

326
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,609
Beside, don't you think it's strange?

327
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:31,009
Don't car thieves do they job inconspicuously

328
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,609
so that nobody notices?

329
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,609
Why would they go doing something conspicuous

330
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:36,509
like crashing into other people's cars?

331
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:38,209
Beats me.

332
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,709
Maybe he found the key in the car,

333
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,609
so he was going to steal the car and split,

334
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:48,609
but he crashed into Mr. Fukuchi's car that came rushing out in reverse?

335
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,309
But, I don't think that's possible,

336
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,609
because of the word "Die" is written on the windshield.

337
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:54,809
If it were mere theft,

338
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,709
the wallet that was in the car would've been taken too.

339
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,309
Besides, I don't think you can get out of here

340
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,009
without parking lot ticket.

341
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,609
How should I know?

342
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:05,109
Ask the culprit, will you?

343
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:06,209
More than that,

344
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:09,509
haven't you witnessed any suspicious people?

345
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:11,109
No, not in particular.

346
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,209
Come to think of it, what were you doing

347
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,809
for nearly 30 minutes?

348
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,809
You were along, just the two of you, right?

349
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,009
Were you talking to each other?

350
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:20,809
Talking about what?

351
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,209
I was just investigating this parking with her!

352
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:26,909
Because she suggested that we should check

353
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:29,709
the cars that have been attacked.

354
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,209
You keep referring to her as "her".

355
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:34,309
Didn't you get her name yet?

356
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:36,309
Come to think of it,

357
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:38,009
I haven't yet.

358
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,409
Right! My name is...

359
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,509
About this car theft...

360
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,609
Is the place where the word "Die" is written,

361
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,809
always at random?

362
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,509
No.

363
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:53,009
Until now, it was always on the ceiling.

364
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:55,009
This was the first time it was written on the windshield.

365
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,909
Then, maybe somebody copied the culprit.

366
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,409
No, it's not a copy-cat crime.

367
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:03,309
The spray can that was used in the burglaries up to now

368
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,609
was found on the floor of the car.

369
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,909
The car with the word "Die" on it

370
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:10,709
hasn't been made public yet, so...

371
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,209
Hey, Conan!

372
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,709
We were doing pretty good, and yet...

373
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,509
Don't get in our way!

374
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,509
Pick up vibes, will you?

375
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,909
But still, why was Mr. Shigei's car attacked?

376
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,309
There was no freakish things in the car though.

377
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,109
Freakish?

378
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:35,509
I mean toys, dolls and the like.

379
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,709
Why would I have to buy things like that?

380
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,009
As for dolls...

381
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,309
there were a lot in the car over there!

382
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,209
Huh?

383
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,609
You can say that again!

384
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,909
It's full of stuffed dolls!

385
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,909
But, they're scattered all around.

386
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,309
I was hit, so it got scattered.

387
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:58,309
My daughter usually lines them out nicely on display.

388
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,609
But, I can't figure it out.

389
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,209
If this were to have been done by the same culprit...

390
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,709
why did he attack this car?

391
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,009
And change the place where he sprayed the paint...

392
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,709
Moreover, to move and hit it from behind,

393
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,109
to the extent of wanting to damage it,

394
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:18,509
was it because he was outraged by this car?

395
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:25,009
The backseat discolored by the sun.

396
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:28,509
Don't tell me that this is why the car was attacked.

397
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:32,809
I'd like to make a declaration.

398
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,509
As a result of careful investigation...

399
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:40,409
there was no one other than you three, after all!

400
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,609
This means that the culprit is among you, right?

401
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,709
No.

402
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,909
Why am I, who was hit from behind

403
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,909
also included as one of the suspects?

404
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,609
Why not?

405
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,909
There's a possibility that you deliberately hit the car,

406
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,509
and passed out, making it look as if you were the victim.

407
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:00,309
Give me a break!

408
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:03,009
My wife and daughter are waiting for me to come home.

409
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:04,309
Same here,

410
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:07,409
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

411
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,009
I got to hurry home too,

412
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,709
or my parents will get on my back.

413
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,309
Don't tell me, you give a hoot about your parents?

414
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,009
Yeah. They happen to be school teachers, you know.

415
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,909
And, they didn't say anything

416
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,909
about that flashy wing on your car?

417
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,709
It doesn't look like your car passed the safety check, does it?

418
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,909
No, they haven't seen it.

419
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:29,409
Come to think of it,

420
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,409
there was a wing on the third car that was attacked, right?

421
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:34,709
Yes.

422
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:38,109
But, your car wasn't attacked, was it?

423
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:39,709
I wonder why.

424
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:40,909
How should I know?

425
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:46,609
The wing on your car is much flashier

426
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,209
and the position of the wing is higher too.

427
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,009
If you check the car that was attacked in more detail,

428
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:54,809
maybe you'll find something more.

429
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:55,909
If so,

430
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,709
would you like to look at the pictures taken from a different angle too?

431
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,509
I brought it along in my mini patrol car that's parked outside.

432
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,409
I'll go get it then!

433
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,909
Thank you!

434
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:08,709
Hey, Officer Chiba, don't you have to go with her?

435
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:09,709
Why?

436
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:11,409
If there are a lot of pictures,

437
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,209
it'll be tough bringing them all here, right?

438
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:16,709
It's the duty of men to help women!

439
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,909
-Come on. -Go on, hurry!

440
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,740
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,860
"Rear window".

442
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,780
Let's get the two!

443
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,380
-Together! -Aye!

444
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,100
I think you're wasting your time.
