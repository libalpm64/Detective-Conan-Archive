1
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:03,848
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:05,748
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:07,448
Open your mouth wide and say "Ah".

4
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:08,848
How will this quite amusing action

5
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:10,448
play a role in today's case?

6
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:11,848
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,548
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:15,948
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,970
"Thistle butterflies"

10
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,270
"The Fatal Ah"

11
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,670
Please hurry up, Mr. Mouri. Can't you run faster?

12
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,370
I'm doing my best.

13
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,170
Why don't you try to lose more weight, Ms. Nitta?

14
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,970
Huh, did you say something?

15
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,570
Maybe something's wrong with my hearing aid.

16
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,470
Way back. The room at the very end.

17
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,070
It is a remodeled gun.

18
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,270
He is a famous detective.

19
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,670
He'll solve the case in the wink of an eye.

20
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,170
-A cold? -No, I'm okay.

21
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,070
Watch out, because they say "Physician heal thyself."

22
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,870
Oh, come on, I am not a doctor.

23
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,970
I'm just a dentist's assistant, that's all.

24
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,670
Well, let us continue.

25
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,270
Ms. Nitta heard what sounded like a gun just before 3pm.

26
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,670
To be exact, it was 2.45pm.

27
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:53,070
When I woke up from my daily nap, and Ms. Suzuki came.

28
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,370
A crust of bread?

29
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,570
Yes, I made sandwiches for today's lunch

30
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,670
and happened to remember that you like to feed the carps in the pond.

31
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,670
Thank you. I am going there today, too.

32
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,170
I appreciate it.

33
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,470
Aren't you going to the dental clinic today?

34
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,370
I took a day off.

35
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,270
Let's have a tea break after I come back.

36
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,070
I will be back after 3pm.

37
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,870
What is that sound?

38
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,070
It came from Mr. Yamamoto's room.

39
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,770
Wasn't it the sound of a gun?

40
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,970
No way.

41
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,170
You are right.

42
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,570
It can't be in broad daylight in a place like this.

43
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,370
The carps must be starving and waiting for me.

44
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,570
See you later.

45
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,970
Afterwards, I returned a little bit before 3pm and...

46
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,470
Has any change come over your neighbor since then?

47
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,170
No, nothing.

48
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,470
Hello, Mr. Nakanishi.

49
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,970
He used to live in your room.

50
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,170
Huh?

51
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,470
The door is left open.

52
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,870
It looks like a will.

53
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,470
I've heard that Mr. Nakanishi and Mr. Yamamoto were best friends.

54
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,270
Even if Mr. Yamamoto did commit suicide,

55
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,070
isn't it strange that his best friend went home

56
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,870
without calling the police or the ambulance?

57
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,170
You mean he left as if fleeing?

58
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,870
That's right. I'm sure there's something to this.

59
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,470
He's got to be the killer no matter how you look at it.

60
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,670
He is surely a suspicious man.

61
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,670
I will ask Inspector Megure to come.

62
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,070
Ran asked me to buy some cakes and I'm on my way back,

63
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,970
I happened to see Ms. Nitta who was running to police,

64
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,970
That's why I am here.

65
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,570
It is addressed to Mr. Nakanishi.

66
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,370
It says he will commit suicide in apology

67
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,570
of not being able to return the money borrowed.

68
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,170
But the will is typed with a word processor.

69
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,670
We can't conclude that Mr. Yamamoto wrote it himself.

70
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,770
What bothers me most...

71
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,870
Is despite having found the dead body of his childhood friend,

72
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,370
why did he just split without informing anyone about it?

73
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,470
Yes.

74
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,170
I didn't think such a thing would happen in broad daylight like this.

75
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,770
Back then I was...

76
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,470
The intuition of an ex-police officer tells me that

77
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,170
the murderer was Nakanishi, who was Mr. Yamamoto's childhood friend.

78
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,970
The motive was money trouble between them.

79
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,270
Mr. Mouri.

80
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,270
On the basis of the autopsy, we can't say it was murder.

81
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,570
The reason is that no trace of resistance was found at all.

82
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,570
No resistance?

83
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,270
If a gun had been thrust into his mouth,

84
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,370
scars resulting from resistance

85
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,970
would've been left on his teeth or lips.

86
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,370
Since none were found,

87
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,370
we can't help believing that he opened his mouth voluntarily.

88
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,270
Take a look at this, Inspector.

89
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,070
True, there are no traces of struggle.

90
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,870
You're probably right, but...

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,470
The butterflies are called thistle butterflies, it says,

92
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,570
and this plant is...

93
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,470
We don't have time to be wasting with you.

94
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,570
Don't bother us. Get lost!

95
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,470
Inspector, as the result of verification,

96
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,470
we found that Mr. Yamamoto had been arrested in the past

97
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,670
on charges of possessing a remodeled gun.

98
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,070
Ms. Suzuki, his next door neighbor, says that

99
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,270
he would burst in rage

100
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,170
when there were complaints about the volume of his T.V.

101
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,770
and his only purpose in life seemed to be butterflies.

102
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,470
Inspector, I can't imagine that such an insensitive man

103
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,070
would kill himself over debts.

104
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,470
Mr. Mouri.

105
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,370
We don't understand this.

106
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,270
It was about 2.45pm when Ms. Suzuki and Ms. Nittta

107
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,170
heard the sound of the gun.

108
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,970
It was a little after 3pm, when Ms. Nitta saw Nakanishi.

109
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,470
Let's suppose that Nakanishi is the murderer.

110
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,870
What was he doing during this period of 15 minutes?

111
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,970
If he were the real murderer,

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,370
he would have left the scene as soon as he could.

113
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,070
Inspector, here is Mr. Nakanishi.

114
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,270
"Saburo Nakanishi (30), Yamamoto's childhood friend"

115
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,470
See? I came here at the promised time of 3pm.

116
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,970
When I entered his room,

117
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,370
Yamamoto was already on the sofa, dead.

118
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,570
You found his dead body,

119
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,170
but you're his childhood friend, aren't you?

120
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,170
Why didn't you immediately inform the police?

121
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,270
I loaned him money.

122
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,270
I was afraid that you might think I killed him

123
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,270
because of money trouble and ran away.

124
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,170
No, don't lie.

125
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,570
In order not to leave your fingerprints and the gun power smoke behind,

126
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,370
you wrapped your gun with a towel.

127
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,070
Around 2.45pm,

128
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,770
you thrust your gun into Mr. Yamamoto's mouth

129
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,670
and shot him to make it look like suicide.

130
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,770
Two people heard the report of the gunfire.

131
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,070
Wait a second.

132
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,170
How could I thrust the gun into Yamamoto's mouth?

133
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,170
Are you saying he just waited for the gun to be fired

134
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,770
with his mouth wide open?

135
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,970
Well, it's possible to think that you waited

136
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,070
for Mr. Yamamoto to yawn or something. Yes!

137
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,770
He was in the midst of being pursued by collectors.

138
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,770
Do you think he had the composure to yawn with his mouth wide open

139
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,170
in a situation like that?

140
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,470
I see your point, but...

141
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,170
What Mr. Nakanishi says is right.

142
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,170
It is unreasonable to say that this man did it.

143
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,870
Let me ask you one more thing.

144
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,970
At the estimated time of Mr. Yamamoto's death around 2.45pm,

145
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,870
tell me where were you and what you were doing.

146
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,670
In the taxi coming here.

147
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,570
What is the name of the taxi company?

148
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,670
I don't remember. It was a blue car.

149
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,470
A picture of a dove or a mouse was painted on it.

150
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,770
I will check it.

151
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,470
He is just making useless efforts to buy time.

152
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,170
That man is sure unlucky to have to confront Mr. Mouri.

153
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,270
He has no way out.

154
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,770
Mr. Mouri, I am going to have tea with Ms. Nitta.

155
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,670
If it's okay with you, please join us.

156
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,570
Thank you. Let's have the cake I bought.

157
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,570
Darn, I can't get money back.

158
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,470
If Mr. Yamamoto had indeed killed himself,

159
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,070
I wonder what he had in mind for the butterflies after his death.

160
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,570
He treasured the butterflies and raised them.

161
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,770
There must be something else I haven't noticed.

162
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,670
What is it?

163
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:20,198
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

164
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:23,398
Now, let's have the cake.

165
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:26,898
Strawberries.

166
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,498
Open your mouth, Conan.

167
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,098
Come on, say ah.

168
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:38,098
Mr. Mouri, forget about business.

169
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:41,098
Here, have a strawberry!

170
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,998
No, thanks. I am a grownup.

171
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:46,298
Well, if you insist.

172
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:48,698
Conan, don't say anything about this to Ran.

173
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,998
Here, open your mouth.

174
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:55,498
What a loose fish.

175
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,898
Shall I add some brandy to your tea?

176
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,698
Great.

177
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,398
A little while more, a little while more,

178
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:12,898
and just how long do I have to wait?

179
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:16,398
My men are looking desperately for it now, too.

180
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:20,498
This is Mr. Yamamoto's consultation ticket.

181
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,998
I wonder what Mr. Mouri is going to use it for.

182
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:24,698
I guess he wants to find out

183
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:27,798
if Mr. Yamamoto was consulting a dentist.

184
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:31,498
And, if he was, which dentist.

185
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,198
Thank you.

186
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:36,798
Yes, Mr. Nobuo Yamamoto. Your patient.

187
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,898
It was cancelled?

188
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,898
I will send Conan over, as my messenger,

189
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:44,998
so please explain it to him.

190
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,698
"Beika Taxi Corp."

191
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,198
"Shinjuku Wireless. Taisho Taxi."

192
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:03,598
Officer Chiba.

193
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,798
Did you find out which taxi Mr. Nakanishi rode?

194
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:11,598
Not yet, or Nakanishi could be lying.

195
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:16,698
Well, Pops says he has something he wants you to look over.

196
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:20,198
Pops, wake up please, Pops.

197
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,898
One more? Okay.

198
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:25,798
I am sorry, he seemed to enjoy drinking a lot,

199
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,598
so I couldn't help offering him more and more.

200
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:29,898
Pops, wake up!

201
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,398
Can you help me?

202
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:34,298
No more? No more strawberries and no more...

203
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:38,298
What a pity, Inspector, talk about unlucky.

204
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,498
Just what are you talking about?

205
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,798
It's about time we leave.

206
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:45,098
Come on, get up.

207
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,498
Hey, just where are you taking me?

208
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:51,198
Till we find the taxi you took, you're a suspect.

209
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,798
Nonsense. I've got nothing to do with it!

210
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:56,198
You are a poor loser.

211
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,398
Why don't you resign and admit what you did?

212
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,698
That's what I'd like to say, but...

213
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:10,898
Inspector, though Mr. Yamamoto's death is due to homicide,

214
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,898
that man has nothing to do with it.

215
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:17,198
Mr. Yamamoto was killed under the pretense of suicide.

216
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,698
Pretense? Who did?

217
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,098
Any evidence?

218
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:25,198
As you see, Mr. Yamamoto loved butterflies.

219
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,398
He would've thought of what would happen to his butterflies if he died,

220
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:33,298
so he would've released them before he killed himself.

221
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:37,198
Again, that's where Mr. Yamamoto was sitting.

222
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:38,998
If he fires the gun from there,

223
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:42,498
the bullet would go through the glass case and shatter it.

224
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:45,998
At worst, it may harm the butterflies.

225
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:49,698
He would never kill himself in a place like this.

226
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,298
True.

227
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,498
Mr. Yamamoto called the dental clinic

228
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:56,698
to cancel the appointment around 2.30pm.

229
00:13:56,698 --> 00:14:00,698
In other words, he was killed between 2.30pm and 3pm

230
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:03,798
when Mr. Nakanishi found his body.

231
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:05,998
It was 2.45pm.

232
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:09,398
Some people must've surely heard the gunshot.

233
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:11,398
But, before that,

234
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:15,798
how did the killer manage to put the gun in Mr. Yamamoto's mouth?

235
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:20,798
Mr. Yamamoto opened his mouth as the killer told him to.

236
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:23,198
Open his mouth like he was told to?

237
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,998
If he was a child, maybe, but he's an adult.

238
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:31,098
There was a person who could manipulate him that far.

239
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,398
Who could it be?

240
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:36,698
Inspector, if someone told you to open your mouth wide,

241
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:39,098
who would you open it obediently for?

242
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:40,498
Obediently?

243
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,698
My wife, grandma...

244
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,798
Hey, open your mouth wide!

245
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,198
Open wide, ah...

246
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:48,198
A doctor!

247
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,898
That's right, a doctor.

248
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:53,198
Almost all dentists, in particular would say so.

249
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:55,398
A dentist is the murderer?

250
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:57,398
The dentist visited this room?

251
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,898
No. The person who came here was working at a dental clinic.

252
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,698
And, that person had met Mr. Yamamoto before

253
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:07,198
and knew about his debts.

254
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,098
Who is that person?

255
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,298
Ms. Yumi Suzuki.

256
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:14,298
You are working at Beika Dental Clinic as an assistant.

257
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:17,698
Mr. Yamamoto was seeing a dentist there.

258
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,998
I see thin lines on the skin behind your ears.

259
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:23,198
They must be traces of the rubber supporter of the masks

260
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,198
you have been wearing for years.

261
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,198
You told the clinic today that you had urgent business to take care

262
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:29,898
and took a day off.

263
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,498
You eavesdropped that

264
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,898
Mr. Nakanishi was coming to collect his money at 3pm.

265
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:39,998
You decided to carry out your prearranged plan.

266
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,898
A prearranged plan?

267
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:45,698
You moved into this condominium about two months ago.

268
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:48,398
You moved in right after Mr. Yamamoto

269
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:51,398
started going to the clinic you were working at.

270
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:53,498
Your purpose was to pretend that you just happened to meet Mr. Yamamoto.

271
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,998
You wanted to approach him.

272
00:15:55,998 --> 00:16:00,598
And you exchanged words with Mr. Yamamoto as you had planned.

273
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:04,498
You found that Mr. Yamamoto was up to his ears in debt.

274
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,998
Taking advantage of this, you wrote a scenario of

275
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:09,798
"a suicide caused by debts."

276
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,598
On a weekday afternoon like today,

277
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:15,798
there are only a few residents in this condominium who are at home.

278
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,798
Perhaps, a little after 2.30pm,

279
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:21,898
Ms. Nitta removed her hearing aid and took her daily nap.

280
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,098
Today is your consultation day, isn't it?

281
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,698
Let me have a look at it.

282
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,698
I'll do it free of charge because you're my neighbor.

283
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,298
Hurry, let me in.

284
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,998
Yes. I have some business to attend to,

285
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,698
so please cancel my appointment.

286
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:00,998
Drinks later, okay? It'll be over soon.

287
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,398
Let's begin, shall we?

288
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:17,898
Please close your eyes, since the lighting is too bright.

289
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:20,398
Here we go. Please open your mouth.

290
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,098
Ah.

291
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,098
It'll be over soon.

292
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,398
You set a tape recorder which had recorded

293
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,498
the sound of gunfire in advance,

294
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,898
and went out to see Ms. Nitta with some crumbs of bread.

295
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:44,298
At 2.45pm when Mr. Yamamoto is supposed to have died,

296
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:45,798
you were with Ms. Nitta.

297
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,998
In short, you made an alibi for yourself.

298
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:52,498
Ms. Nitta went out to feed the carps.

299
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,498
You saw her off...

300
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,998
And Mr. Yamamoto "died" at 2.45pm.

301
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:07,498
Furthermore, you deliberately planned to let Mr. Nakanishi

302
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,398
find his dead body at 3pm.

303
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:12,198
In short, it was a disguised suicide.

304
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:14,998
No, I didn't do it.

305
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:18,598
I do not have a reason for killing Mr. Yamamoto.

306
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,998
Yes, you do.

307
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,098
I have checked it, Ms. Suzuki.

308
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:27,498
Your husband had a traffic accident 10 years ago in his homeland, Gifu,

309
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:30,898
and is currently still unconscious in the hospital.

310
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,398
Oh, it's a Gifu butterfly.

311
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,798
The driver was Mr. Nobuo Yamamoto.

312
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,098
He was distracted by butterflies and failed to keep his eyes on the road.

313
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,398
Moreover, he was drunk.

314
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:09,298
Then, he happens to visit your clinic for dental treatment

315
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,598
and meet you again.

316
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,998
You decide to take revenge for what he did to your husband.

317
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,098
-Am I wrong? -You're wrong.

318
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,198
It's true that

319
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,098
Yamamoto took my husband's profession as a dentist away from him

320
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:22,598
and ruined his whole life.

321
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,698
But, I didn't kill him.

322
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,598
I've never been to this room either.

323
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,498
I seem to have caught a cold.

324
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,598
Please excuse me.

325
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,698
I would like to say, "Please take good care of yourself."

326
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:38,298
But Ms. Yumi, that isn't a cold.

327
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:40,798
Perhaps, it's hay fever.

328
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:42,298
Hay fever?

329
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,698
Yeah, hay fever caused by mugwort.

330
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:46,598
Hay fever caused by mugwort?

331
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,198
I found it in a book in this room.

332
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:52,598
It says a thistle butterfly lives on mugwort.

333
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:56,298
Mugwort is a favorite for the thistle butterfly.

334
00:19:56,298 --> 00:20:00,398
But it can cause hay fever in human, it says.

335
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:04,598
One more thing, your hair is a bit shiny.

336
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:07,398
It is probably the powder from the wings of butterflies.

337
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:11,198
Mr. Mouri, I am living next door.

338
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:14,098
Mugwort powder might have flown and come to my room.

339
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,498
Some butterflies might have escaped and alighted on my body

340
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:17,998
although I didn't notice them.

341
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:20,098
Conan, bring me that thing.

342
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:29,398
Do you know what is this?

343
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:32,898
Yes. It is a dental mirror to examine the inner side of teeth.

344
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,198
Though I knew it was a rude request,

345
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,798
I borrowed this from Beika Dental Clinic.

346
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,498
It has the initials of Beika Dental Clinic "BDC" on it

347
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:42,098
and they told me that it is special ordered.

348
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:45,098
Have you ever met a person who wanted to own it

349
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,998
or a person who went home with it?

350
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,898
No. None.

351
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:53,898
Inspector, there is a coffee cup under the table.

352
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:56,098
Please have a look.

353
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:01,198
It looks like an ordinary coffee to me.

354
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,298
What about it?

355
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:06,098
There is a stir stick inside.

356
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,498
The stick, please pull it out slowly.

357
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,398
Why is it here? Why?

358
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:37,098
You're the only one who could've brought

359
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:39,098
the dental mirror into this room.

360
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,798
What would you say?

361
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:47,298
Yamamoto came to our clinic.

362
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:50,798
Of course he had forgotten my face and name.

363
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:52,298
One thing I couldn't forgive him for

364
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:56,198
was that he drove drunk to our clinic,

365
00:21:56,198 --> 00:22:00,398
despite promising never drink and drive again.

366
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:03,498
He showed no apologetic signs for what he had done.

367
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:05,698
Thinking of it, made me feel sorry for my husband.

368
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:07,798
That's why I...

369
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,298
I am sorry.

370
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:44,898
"Mouri Detective Agency"

371
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:48,398
You see, I must explain to you about the cake.

372
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:50,998
I didn't mean to lie to you, Ran.

373
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,698
Please open the door.

374
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,598
Hey, she has turned off the switch.

375
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:58,598
Ran must have turned off her switch towards us too.

376
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,698
Is this the karma for "ah"?

377
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,520
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,520
"Amnesia"

379
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,340
Officer Chiba, do you remember today's murderer?

380
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,620
-Today's almond jelly? -No, murderer.

381
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,800
-Did I eat it? -What?
