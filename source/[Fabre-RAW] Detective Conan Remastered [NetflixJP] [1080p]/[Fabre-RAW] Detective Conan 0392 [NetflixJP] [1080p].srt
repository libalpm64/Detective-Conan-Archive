1
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:24,772
Today's case involves Officer Takagi.

2
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,372
An unimaginable alibi trick.

3
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:27,972
Will the police be able to outwit the killer?

4
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,472
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:31,172
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:32,972
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,628 --> 00:02:00,428
I've to a lot of things to buy today, so be prepared, okay?

8
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:01,828
Yes.

9
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,228
She sure is in a good mood.

10
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,228
It sure feels good today!

11
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,128
Yes. True.

12
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:19,628
-Conan? -I'll be right back!

13
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:24,028
I'm sorry to bother you many times.

14
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:26,028
I'd like to confirm the time and situation of

15
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,028
when the body was found again.

16
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,528
The time was yesterday at 8 am.

17
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,628
The president didn't show up for the morning assembly before work

18
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,228
so you went to call him.

19
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:36,528
Yes, sir!

20
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,528
This way, please.

21
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:38,828
The president's room is in another building?

22
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:41,328
Yes, it's beyond the office.

23
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,728
You found President Katsugoro Kitamura lying there on the floor.

24
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:47,028
Yes, sir. That's right.

25
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,328
President.

26
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:54,628
Excuse me.

27
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:58,928
President, is there going to be no morning assembly today?

28
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:03,328
President!

29
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,728
President?

30
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:11,928
President!

31
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:19,428
"Mysterious 20 cm Height Discrepancy"

32
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:23,028
Did you notice anything at that time?

33
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,128
Not that I can remember.

34
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:27,128
The culprit was already arrested, right?

35
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:28,428
Why are you investigating things again?

36
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,728
You don't have concrete evidence?

37
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:33,128
Yeah. Rather we found out something totally absurd.

38
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:36,028
Hey, what's that absurd thing that you found out about?

39
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,928
Conan?

40
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:39,028
Conan!

41
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:40,428
Conan, you can't just run off like that.

42
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,828
Ran?

43
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:43,328
I'm so sorry!

44
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,628
And what's that absurd thing that you were talking about?

45
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:47,528
Yes. Well...

46
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,528
The victim is Mr. Katsugoro Kitamura, age 47.

47
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,128
He is the president of this factory.

48
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,028
The estimated time of death is

49
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,828
between 4 pm to 10 pm.

50
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:03,128
Soon after the body was found,

51
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,628
a cordon was set up.

52
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:05,628
The following day, which is yesterday,

53
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,128
the suspect was taken custody at the police.

54
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:10,128
However...

55
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,328
The suspect is Yuichi Minamida, age 47.

56
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:19,728
He is an owner chef of a small western food restaurant

57
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,128
and...

58
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,728
I was a classmate of the victim in high school.

59
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:25,428
"Yuichi Minamida (47)" -It's true that I went

60
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:27,628
to Kitamura's place yesterday.

61
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,628
But, I didn't do it.

62
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:33,528
You had a debt of three million yen that you owed Mr. Kitamura.

63
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,228
He refused to extend the deadline for your repayment,

64
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:37,628
so you were cornered and stabbed him.

65
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:40,628
-That's the story, isn't it? -Do you have evidence?

66
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,728
Are my prints on the knife that is the murder weapon?

67
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:46,028
They didn't detected any fingerprints

68
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,428
but the knife was discovered in his home.

69
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,528
In other words, the fingerprints were wiped off completely

70
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:52,328
after the murder was committed.

71
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,028
Inspector.

72
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:06,928
Beside owing Mr. Kitamura money,

73
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:09,828
you have another strong motive to kill him, don't you?

74
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:17,228
Mr. Kitamura was after your shop and your land.

75
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:21,128
He spread rumors about the sanitation standards at your shop,

76
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:23,128
which sent you into a financial rut.

77
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:26,228
Three months ago, he lent you three million yen.

78
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:33,228
"Katsugoro Kitamura (47), Factory President"

79
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:36,028
Minamida, after finding out what Mr. Kitamura was actually after,

80
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:40,028
was enraged and told the people around him how vexed he was.

81
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:41,528
On the day of payment,

82
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:43,328
which is also the day the murder was committed, at 1 pm,

83
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:47,328
Minamida appeared at this office to see Mr. Kitamura.

84
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:50,128
It's already 3 pm, just how long do you intend to stay here?

85
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:51,928
Please! Just another three days...

86
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:53,428
No, two days will do.

87
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:56,128
I lent you the cash because of the good old times.

88
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:59,228
If you don't have the cash, give me the deed to the land.

89
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,728
Kitamura!

90
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:06,028
What the...

91
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,228
Excuse me, president!

92
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,928
We're having some problems with the machine.

93
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,128
Okay! Go on ahead!

94
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:15,428
Yes, sir. Thank you.

95
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:19,228
Geez! I guess I have no choice.

96
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:21,328
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,328
I know just what you're after!

98
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:24,628
Let go of me!

99
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,528
You schemed it from the very start!

100
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:29,028
-Let go! -You were after my land to begin with!

101
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,328
So what?

102
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,128
Leave your deed here and get lost.

103
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,428
You darn loser!

104
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:42,128
I think those words made Minamida make up his mind.

105
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,228
He waited for Mr. Kitamura to return.

106
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,628
But Minamida...

107
00:06:56,628 --> 00:07:00,628
Yes, he did come back after about 30 minutes.

108
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,828
I started to negotiate with him once again,

109
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,328
and stayed there until around 6 pm in the evening,

110
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:08,228
but was eventually kicked out of the room.

111
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,928
What? A person who can testify to that?

112
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:12,928
I don't know.

113
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:15,928
I see! You've got all the circumstantial evidence,

114
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,328
but no concrete evidence.

115
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:22,328
I'm sure this is what Pops would say.

116
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,928
You haven't told me about the absurd thing yet!

117
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:29,728
The absurd thing is

118
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,328
the height difference between the suspect and Minamida.

119
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,628
Height difference?

120
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:34,928
What do you mean by that?

121
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,928
He's pretty tough to handle.

122
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:39,928
Besides...

123
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:44,028
The strange confidence I sense from him bothers me too.

124
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,928
Inspector!

125
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,428
I got an absurd report from the forensic officer.

126
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,728
The height of the victim Kitamura is 166 cm

127
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:56,028
and Minamida is 186 cm.

128
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:58,528
Minamida is 20 cm taller.

129
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,228
If so, then what?

130
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:05,028
In the case that a tall person stabs a person shorter than he is,

131
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,728
the angle of the knife would usually be from diagonally above.

132
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:11,928
On the other hand, if a short person stabs someone taller than himself,

133
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,928
it would be from diagonally below.

134
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,628
The knife that was stabbed into Kitamura's chest was

135
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,528
from diagonally below. In other words...

136
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:21,028
It's impossible for Minamida who is 20 cm taller

137
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:24,228
to have committed the crime.

138
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,228
No way.

139
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,628
So, I had the forensic officers use the angle of the knife

140
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:29,728
to calculate backwards

141
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:32,628
and come up with the height of the killer.

142
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,428
-And? -Yes, sir!

143
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:37,628
The results came out to be that the person is 110 cm.

144
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:38,728
-What? -What?

145
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,628
110 cm?

146
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:43,128
Isn't that the height of a child?

147
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:46,828
I get it!

148
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,828
If the killer stabbed from below where there are stairs,

149
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,528
even with Mr. Minamida's height,

150
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,128
he'd be able to stab from below.

151
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:54,928
The scene of the murder was a one-story building, with no stairs,

152
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:57,228
and there were no traces of the body being moved.

153
00:08:57,228 --> 00:09:00,228
Then! He probably attacked the victim when he was off his guard?

154
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:02,028
Oh! Just what do you think you're doing?

155
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,728
He sank down low on the spur of the moment and stabbed?

156
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:07,428
Takagi. You just stabbed me, didn't you?

157
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,528
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:14,428
Inspector! I think that the killer is Minamida too.

159
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,428
But, the victim was stabbed from the front.

160
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,128
So, it's hard to believe that he was attacked when he was off his guard.

161
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:22,228
Moreover, a week before the incident,

162
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,028
Minamida sprained his ankle.

163
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,428
I wonder if he can make a surprise attack with his leg in a cast.

164
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:30,428
He would never be able to do something like that.

165
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:32,128
He may have been threatened with the knife

166
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,628
and forced to go up somewhere, and stabbed from below.

167
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:36,428
That's not possible.

168
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:39,328
The victim, Mr. Kitamura is a ranking judo belt owner,

169
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,728
so he wouldn't be intimidated by Minamida sticking a knife at him.

170
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,428
Everyone around him says Mr. Kitamura was probably strong

171
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,428
enough to attack Minamida instead.

172
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,728
True, no matter how you look at it.

173
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:52,028
Does that mean the difference in height is what's protecting Minamida?

174
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,728
What? You've got another picture!

175
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,728
No, Conan!

176
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:02,928
What? This man's wearing glasses?

177
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,628
He's not wearing them in the other picture.

178
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,428
Oh, these are reading glasses.

179
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,628
Reading glasses are something you wear when reading something, right?

180
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:13,728
Does that mean that Mr. Kitamura was attacked

181
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,128
when he was reading something?

182
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:19,028
But there's nothing like that in this room.

183
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:23,128
Right, the thing that Mr. Kitamura was supposedly reading back then

184
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,728
is nowhere in sight.

185
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,728
The problem is that something is gone

186
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:29,228
and Minamida took it with him.

187
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,628
Oh! You're right on, Officer Takagi!

188
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,528
What on earth could it be?

189
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:36,828
We still don't know why he took it with him.

190
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:39,428
Hey, are these slippers the president's?

191
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:41,028
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:44,228
What about when Mr. Minamida came the day before yesterday?

193
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,128
Of course he was wearing them.

194
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,428
Mr. Minamida was barefoot though.

195
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:52,628
But, why are the slippers over here like this?

196
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:54,928
They probably came off from the impact when he was stabbed!

197
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:57,028
Impact?

198
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:00,128
But isn't it strange that they came off from the impact

199
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,728
when he was stabbed?

200
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,728
What?

201
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,128
Because they're nicely in place

202
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,428
just as if someone had put them in place, right?

203
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:11,428
I haven't touched them!

204
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:14,128
The slippers have been this way since the body was found.

205
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,528
They came off.

206
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:21,528
If not so, Mr. Minamida took them off after he killed the victim?

207
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:23,928
Why would he go out of his way to do something like that?

208
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,428
You think so, don't you?

209
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:28,828
Or maybe Mr. Kitamura took them off himself?

210
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:30,328
That's it!

211
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:33,628
But, why would he do something like that?

212
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,328
I can't figure it out!

213
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,128
Stabbed from the front diagonally below.

214
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:39,328
Height difference.

215
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,228
A ladder?

216
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,328
What?

217
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:51,828
What did he do?

218
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,928
President Kitamura.

219
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,728
What did he do?

220
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:58,928
With the ladder?

221
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:03,728
This is it!

222
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:08,528
But wait, why did Minamida think up something like this?

223
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,428
Why would an ordinary chef think up the trick of disguising his height

224
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,828
by doing something like this?

225
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:14,928
Why?

226
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,983
What were you waiting for?

227
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:32,483
At first, we thought it was a crime committed on the spur of the moment.

228
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:35,183
But after watching you, we've come to understand

229
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:38,183
that it was a carefully thought out murder.

230
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:43,283
If so, there's got to be a reason why you stayed in the president's room

231
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:45,783
from 1 pm to 6 pm.

232
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:48,183
You had another purpose other than asking him

233
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,383
to extend the time of repayment of the debt.

234
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:52,083
Five hours in the president's office.

235
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,583
Just what were you waiting for?

236
00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:59,283
A miracle.

237
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,483
I guess.

238
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,783
Officer Takagi.

239
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:13,583
I've found out something absurd!

240
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,583
But, this is only a deduction.

241
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,483
I need evidence that will lead him to confess. Evidence.

242
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:19,583
What?

243
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:23,683
Something absurd?

244
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,983
Another absurd thing.

245
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:28,383
I hope it's not bad news.

246
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:30,383
Ten years ago, there was a series of random killings

247
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:32,583
within the Minato Police Station.

248
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,383
The person who was arrested back then

249
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:37,583
was Yuichi Minamida who was a company employee!

250
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:41,483
Although Minamida denied this,

251
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:44,083
the prosecutor had confidence and indicted him.

252
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:49,283
But the evidence that his lawyers submitted saved Minamida.

253
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:50,783
That proof was the angle of the stab wound

254
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:52,783
that the random killer left behind.

255
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,383
It was proven that with his height,

256
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:57,483
Minamida wouldn't have been able to stab anyone at that angle.

257
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:00,983
Moreover, during his hearing a new killer was arrested.

258
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,483
And the case was solved.

259
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:07,283
Which means that Minamida knew from the start

260
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:08,883
that the height difference between him

261
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:10,883
and the victim would serve as evidence in court?

262
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,383
I see! That's why he thought up this trick.

263
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:16,683
Right. In this case,

264
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:19,483
a trick involving height difference was used!

265
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,483
A trick using height difference is involved.

266
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:27,883
And what kind of trick is that, Officer Sato?

267
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,083
I haven't figured it out yet.

268
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,383
I'll go report this to Inspector Megure.

269
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,683
Officer Takagi, go back to headquarters right away too!

270
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,083
I'm going back to headquarters then.

271
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,883
Thank you so very much!

272
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,883
No problem.

273
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,583
Hey, you said Mr. Kitamura's height is 166 cm.

274
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,283
It that really tall for an adult or too short?

275
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:53,883
I want to become an adult quickly too,

276
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,383
because it's inconvenient being a child.

277
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:59,183
When things are in high places, I've got to use a ladder.

278
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,383
Adults are lucky at that point

279
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,783
because they don't have to use a ladder.

280
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,183
A ladder.

281
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:08,483
That's not really true.

282
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,483
When cleaning the air conditioner and changing light bulbs,

283
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,983
even Dad uses a ladder.

284
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,283
Light bulbs?

285
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:18,183
If the light bulbs were out at that time...

286
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,283
No way.

287
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,183
You mean the lights so conveniently went out back then?

288
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,683
Conan!

289
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:30,783
My mother used to always say, "Turn on the lights when it gets dark."

290
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:31,983
Conan!

291
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:35,683
She used to say that we'll ruin our eyes if we read in dark places.

292
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,483
In dark places. A book?

293
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:42,883
Reading glasses and...

294
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:44,083
light bulbs.

295
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:47,983
Slippers!

296
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,083
I see!

297
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,383
You guys get going home too! Okay?

298
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,383
All that I need now is proof to make him confess what he did.

299
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,783
Officer Takagi! He seems to have hit upon an idea!

300
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,783
Mr. Yuichi Minamida.

301
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,783
The thing that you waited for five hours

302
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:12,083
in Mr. Kitamura's president's room

303
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,183
was sundown, right?

304
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,783
Sundown?

305
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:22,583
Why would I have to wait for sundown?

306
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,083
Because that's when Mr. Kitamura turns on the lights of the office.

307
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,583
But the chandelier did not turn on that day.

308
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:35,683
Mr. Kitamura, who wanted to check out what was wrong, climbed a ladder.

309
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:37,483
You took this opportunity

310
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:42,983
to stab Mr. Kitamura who is 20 cm shorter than you from below.

311
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:44,783
Ridiculous.

312
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:48,383
Are you saying that the bulbs just happened to go out on that day?

313
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,783
Are you saying that I knew the bulbs were going to go out?

314
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,283
The bulbs didn't go out.

315
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:54,483
You loosened them!

316
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,083
What do you think you're doing?

317
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,083
I know just what you're after!

318
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,083
Let go of me!

319
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,083
You schemed it from the very start!

320
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,783
-Let go! -You were after my land to begin with!

321
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:17,483
Eating, going to the restroom,

322
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:18,483
if you stick it out for five hours,

323
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,283
you had all the opportunity in the world to wait for Mr. Kitamura

324
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:21,783
to leave the office.

325
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:22,883
You probably loosened the bulbs

326
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:24,883
when he left to go check on machine trouble.

327
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:28,283
Mr. Kitamura left the room for 30 minutes.

328
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:29,483
How can you be sure that

329
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:33,283
Kitamura would check the bulbs of the chandelier himself?

330
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:36,583
He's so haughty, it's more likely that he'd call one of his employees.

331
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,983
In order for him not to do so,

332
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,483
you handed over some important documents

333
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:43,583
after it started getting dark.

334
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,783
His reading glasses told us so.

335
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,983
What? Reading glasses?

336
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,283
The dead body was wearing reading glasses.

337
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,683
He was reading something,

338
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:57,683
no rather, it's evidence that he was trying to read something.

339
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:01,883
That something was also very important to the killer.

340
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,683
It was the deed for the land,

341
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,383
where your shop is that Mr. Kitamura wanted, wasn't it?

342
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:11,683
So, you've finally decided to give this to me.

343
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:28,383
It's not a black out.

344
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:30,483
Darn it! Not again.

345
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,383
Why at a time like this?

346
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:36,283
You set it up so that he checked the light himself

347
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,783
because he would find calling one of his employee is a waste of time.

348
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,783
What's this?

349
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,683
They're just loose.

350
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:53,283
You admit to your crime, don't you?

351
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,983
His reading glasses and slippers will probably serve as evidence

352
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,783
that Mr. Kitamura climbed the ladder.

353
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,883
But that's not proof that I loosened the bulbs.

354
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,183
Takagi.

355
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,983
Officer Takagi.

356
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:14,483
Hey, hey.

357
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:16,683
Oh, yes!

358
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,083
It's me, Mouri.

359
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,683
Mr. Mouri!

360
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:22,683
I heard about the case from Ran.

361
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,683
Did Minamida confess?

362
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,183
A little bit more.

363
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:31,583
He demanded that I show him proof that he rigged the chandelier.

364
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,383
Not having proof is the proof.

365
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:36,283
What? Just what do you mean?

366
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:38,083
Yes...

367
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:41,983
I see! I understand, I'll do so right away!

368
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,283
Inspector! I'm going to check with the forensic officers!

369
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:47,983
Hey, Takagi! Takagi!

370
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,883
What on earth is on his mind, anyway?

371
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:53,983
Okay! This is it for now!

372
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,983
-For now? -Yes.

373
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,783
Mr. Minamida, all culprits make mistakes.

374
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:05,183
There was one more thing besides the glasses and the slippers.

375
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,583
After committing the murder,

376
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,583
you wiped off your fingerprints from the knife, the murder weapon.

377
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:14,283
At the same time, you naturally wiped off your fingerprints

378
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:15,983
from the bulbs that you loosened.

379
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:22,183
Yes, the fact that it's not there may sometimes serves as proof.

380
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:24,683
I checked again with the forensic officer

381
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:25,883
whether any fingerprints were found on the chandelier.

382
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:29,283
No fingerprints were found whatsoever.

383
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:32,283
Mr. Kitamura's fingerprints that were supposed to be there weren't either.

384
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:35,883
I confirmed with his bereaved family too.

385
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:39,583
The bulbs of the chandelier also went out a month ago,

386
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,783
and it seems Mr. Kitamura himself changed the bulbs.

387
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,283
And yet, no one's fingerprints were found.

388
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:47,283
This is proof that someone obviously rigged the bulbs.

389
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:49,283
The trick that you used of making Mr. Kitamura climb the ladder

390
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,183
and stabbing him from below

391
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,683
is the same trick of height difference and angle of the stab wound

392
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:58,083
that served as proof to your innocence 10 years ago, Mr. Minamida.

393
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,483
On the contrary, this time lead to accusing you as the killer.

394
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,783
Ten years ago, I was innocent.

395
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,483
But my company fired me as soon as I was arrested.

396
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,083
My father was the only one who believed me.

397
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,383
The shop was the dream of my father who died a year ago.

398
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:24,183
It's his dream that I had to take over and protect.

399
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,983
Kitamura tried to take that away from me!

400
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:30,083
He's the real criminal!

401
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,683
But, no matter what reasons you may have,

402
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,383
what value is there to a dream that you must protect

403
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:37,183
at the expense of someone's life?

404
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:15,683
-At Sanchome! -At Sanchome!

405
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:16,683
There's a black demon!

406
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:18,283
What did he just say?

407
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,683
-I don't know! -Yes!

408
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:23,683
This is the Mouri Detective Agency.

409
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,683
Officer Takagi, what's up?

410
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:28,283
Yes! Thanks to you, he confessed!

411
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:29,583
What? Confessed?

412
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,383
-We're back! -What?

413
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:33,083
Minamida? What?

414
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,183
Thank you so very much!

415
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:36,383
Goodbye.

416
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,383
What is he talking about?

417
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:42,183
Hey, what's the matter, Pops?

418
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:48,183
He said Minamida confessed and thank you.

419
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,583
All right.

420
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,183
Don't tell me something happened again without my knowing?

421
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:56,083
It's pretty interesting being a detective!

422
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,783
I agree with you, Pops!

423
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,910
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,410
"Oil"

425
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,810
I received cookies today.

426
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,010
-What? From who? -You want some?

427
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,010
-That's not what I mean. -I'm not giving you any.
