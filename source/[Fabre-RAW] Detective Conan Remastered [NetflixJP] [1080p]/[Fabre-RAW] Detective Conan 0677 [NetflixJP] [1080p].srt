1
00:00:01,738 --> 00:00:05,138
"Oohama Beach" -A two hours car ride from Beika-cho.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,987
We've come here to Oohama Beach.

3
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:11,991
Pops suddenly says he wants to go surfing.

4
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:15,538
Thinking that refusing would be a hassle,

5
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:17,638
Ran and I go along unwillingly.

6
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,999
Grab your wet suit firmly

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,338
and shove your feet through it.

8
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,005
Tight!

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,038
Yes. If it's loose,

10
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:30,938
water will come in, you see.

11
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,738
This all started because Pops was

12
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,038
"Nagisa Imaoka (25)" -invited to come over by this woman

13
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:43,538
that he had recently met.

14
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:46,025
Exert strength, more!

15
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:51,738
In order not to lose your surfboard,

16
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:54,538
use this leash cord and connect it to your ankle.

17
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:57,138
Make sure the length is a little longer than your surfboard.

18
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:59,538
Approximately two meters for an adult,

19
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:02,338
and 1.5 meters for a child.

20
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:04,043
Doesn't it ever gets severed?

21
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,045
Rarely.

22
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:09,238
But you can never tell what will happen

23
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,238
if you are taken in by a big wave that comes along.

24
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,338
That's one of the interesting things about surfing.

25
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:17,738
Then, shall we go ride the waves?

26
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:54,938
The vivid colored memories of summer.

27
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:57,038
Solve mysteries all season round.

28
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:58,838
Along the vast sandy beach,

29
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:01,238
a figure of a person lies, with no footprints around.

30
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,938
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:04,938
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:07,338
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:51,573
"A Sandy Beach Without Footprints".

34
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:04,223
Are you Mr. Mouri?

35
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,673
I'm sorry,

36
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:06,873
I've been out doing some purchasing,

37
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,873
so I wasn't here to introduce myself.

38
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:13,473
I heard from Nagisa that the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri would be here,

39
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,373
"Umishiro Imaoka (60)" -and was looking forward to meeting you.

40
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,773
I am Umishiro Imaoka.

41
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:19,473
How do you do?

42
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:22,673
Well, this is my first experience at surfing,

43
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:24,243
but it sure is a lot of fun.

44
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:27,873
I'm the type of guy that likes to go along with the flow.

45
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:29,273
So, likewise, with surfing.

46
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:31,873
You're the type who gets carried away.

47
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,673
I feel that I'm wasting my time being here like this.

48
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,573
I'm dying to ride the waves.

49
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:42,973
Sir, is this a calendar of the spring tide?

50
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:45,073
Yes, it is, Sonny.

51
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:46,673
Looking at this...

52
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,573
Tonight's going to be the night of the spring tide, right?

53
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:51,473
Yeah. Oohama Beach here

54
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:55,373
is famous for the great gap during high tide and low tide.

55
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:59,373
During high tide late at night... Let's see.

56
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:03,873
The shore becomes about 100 meters closer.

57
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:05,473
But, in the morning,

58
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,673
the tides withdraw as if fleeing

59
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:11,673
and a shallow water beach that seems to have been washed by the waters,

60
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:15,373
spread over a distance of about one kilometer.

61
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:16,295
It's fun getting up early

62
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:19,573
and making footprints in the sand too.

63
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:22,301
I understand.

64
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,073
For example, if you get to do this in the snow

65
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,273
where no one else has passed...

66
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,973
Dad!

67
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,073
Are these trophies yours?

68
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:34,773
Yes, they are.

69
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,315
In the world of amateurs,

70
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,773
she was a pretty good surfer.

71
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,319
No wonder.

72
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,973
Well, how lucky of you to have such a wonderful daughter.

73
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:47,673
Well, how embarrassing of me.

74
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:49,873
The fact is, she's not my daughter.

75
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:52,973
Dont tell me that...

76
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,973
he's your son? A boy?

77
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,873
No, no. Was married.

78
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,273
She's my wife.

79
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:01,173
Wife?

80
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:03,573
Which means that she's married?

81
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,345
We have an age difference of 35 years.

82
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,673
Don't let that get you down, Pops.

83
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,673
Dad, come on. Let's continue surfing.

84
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,273
Right, Conan?

85
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:20,359
Yup!

86
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:25,073
I've had enough. I'm kind of tired.

87
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:28,367
Right, I see, you're his wife.

88
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,371
Nagisa, I'm ready.

89
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,773
Okay! Let's go then.

90
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,073
Don't!

91
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,873
According to the weather forecast I heard in the car,

92
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:44,383
low atmospheric pressure seems to be closing in.

93
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:45,873
Look at the waves.

94
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,073
The tip of the waves is turning white.

95
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:54,673
I've heard that surfing is more enjoyable

96
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:57,373
when the waves are a bit high.

97
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,173
There are people who say that,

98
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,173
but I'm against it.

99
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,873
Especially because you're beginners, aren't you?

100
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,405
There are many people who are taken away by the high tides

101
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,873
and lose their lives, you know.

102
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:10,073
You should never take the sea lightly.

103
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:14,413
You can't enjoy surfing talking chicken like that!

104
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,673
I'm with you, so you'll be fine.

105
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:18,973
Don't get conceited!

106
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:22,421
What the hell can you do, against the high tides?

107
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,173
Enough of your conceit!

108
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:36,173
Oh, no. I'm sorry I raised my voice.

109
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:38,437
No, no, it's okay.

110
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,439
I'm sure that the low atmospheric pressure will pass by morning.

111
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,773
Wait until then.

112
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:53,173
Really. Don't you have any challenge spirit at all?

113
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:57,173
You're an old man who only finds pleasure in making plastic models.

114
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,973
You're such a bore.

115
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:03,373
I can hear the sea calling, challenge me.

116
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:04,873
This is where the passion burns,

117
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,573
the blood of a surfer girl boils!

118
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:08,973
Do you understand?

119
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,473
Well...

120
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:14,473
I understand the relationship between you two very well.

121
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,475
If we can't surf,

122
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,473
we may as well return to the pension.

123
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:19,873
Right?

124
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,273
I guess so.

125
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,173
Left, left.

126
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,873
No, no, to the right.

127
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:41,773
Right there.

128
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:44,873
Nagisa used to be a customer of that shop?

129
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,173
Yeah.

130
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,973
According to the pension owner,

131
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,873
something about she's going to conquer the waves here.

132
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,511
That's why it seems she's been frequenting coming here.

133
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:57,073
And three years ago, she was conquered instead.

134
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,519
Yes, please come in.

135
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,273
Excuse me.

136
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:05,573
Mr. Imaoka. What seems to be the matter?

137
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,529
Huh? Your wife's not around?

138
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,573
No.

139
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:14,533
I was making preparations in the kitchen for tomorrow,

140
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,535
when she disappeared from sight.

141
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:20,539
So I was wondering if she was over here visiting you.

142
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,973
No, she's not here.

143
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,543
Don't tell me she went to the sea...

144
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,273
Where's your wife's surfboard?

145
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,673
At the shop.

146
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:31,673
Could she has taken a surfboard from the shop?

147
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:33,073
She most probably would.

148
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,173
When she sees the rough sea on a day like this,

149
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,973
her eyes get sharp.

150
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,973
It's almost like a shark going after prey.

151
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:43,373
Sir, something is flashing in your chest pocket.

152
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,273
Maybe something's coming in on your cell phone?

153
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:51,273
It's from my wife.

154
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,571
"I'm sorry, I went off without telling you.

155
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,073
Karaoke now. I'm may stay out all night."

156
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,673
I didn't notice this.

157
00:09:57,673 --> 00:10:00,579
I'm glad she didn't go out to sea.

158
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,773
Even if she were a shark,

159
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,973
there's nothing she can do at a karaoke shop.

160
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,073
Yes.

161
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:07,173
But, how dare she go out without telling me.

162
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,173
I have no idea at all what's on her mind.

163
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:14,593
A worry that comes along with having a young wife, huh?

164
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,073
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

165
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:20,173
This is had recently become a habitual phrase between Nagisa and I.

166
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:38,873
The low atmospheric pressure has passed at daybreak.

167
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:41,473
The tides are all the way off-shore.

168
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,873
It's a beautiful sandy beach, right, Conan?

169
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:46,173
True.

170
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:49,673
Pops.

171
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,173
What could that be?

172
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,173
A drifting wood or something.

173
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:56,635
No?

174
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,173
Isn't that someone wearing a wet suit?

175
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,173
Don't tell me that...

176
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,173
This is...

177
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:09,973
Nagisa?

178
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,973
No good. She's dead.

179
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,273
No.

180
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,073
That's...

181
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,373
At any rate, you contact the police, Ran!

182
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,663
-You bring Mr. Imaoka, Kid. -Yup!

183
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:25,773
And while you're at it,

184
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:28,673
go get some cardboards to put around the corpse too.

185
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:29,973
Okay!

186
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:36,073
I guess the passion of the surfer girl couldn't be stopped.

187
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,973
This is probably a homicide.

188
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:42,681
But...

189
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,373
the only footprints surrounding the corpse are ours,

190
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,973
when we came running over to the body.

191
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,773
How on earth did the culprit...

192
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:05,793
Nagisa...

193
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,593
What the?

194
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:13,593
Sand?

195
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:15,393
Why in a place like that?

196
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,993
Nagisa.

197
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,993
Hold on. He's...

198
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:23,493
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,723
Yeah.

200
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,725
He appears on TV a lot, doesn't he?

201
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,993
Let's go get his autograph later.

202
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,093
I guess so.

203
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,737
And, Mr. Mouri, did you figure something out yet?

204
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,741
Briefly speaking, I would say that

205
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,293
this is an unfortunate accident.

206
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:46,745
So, it's an accident after all.

207
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,747
Yes.

208
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,493
Nagisa, at seeing the rough sea brought about the low atmospheric pressure,

209
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:56,493
probably couldn't hold her impulse in check.

210
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:58,757
Therefore, she lied to her husband, Mr. Imaoka

211
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,793
and sent him a mail saying that she was going to karaoke.

212
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:04,763
She secretly wore the wet suit that was in the workshop

213
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,765
and took the surfboard that was there too,

214
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,767
then headed for the sea from the backdoor.

215
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,393
But, I wonder why she didn't wear her own wet suit

216
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:15,393
that is hanging over there?

217
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:16,775
True.

218
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,393
That's probably because

219
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:22,781
she thought that I, being in the kitchen would see her.

220
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:26,785
And if I did catch her going, she knew that I would stop her.

221
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:31,193
Nagisa really loved surfing, you see.

222
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:34,793
I truly understand how she feels.

223
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:39,893
And while she was enjoying surfing a large wave came and flustered her,

224
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:44,193
it just so happened that the leash cord wrapped around Nagisa's neck.

225
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,393
In addition, the waves pulled the boat along too.

226
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:50,393
And as a result, she eventually was choked to death.

227
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:57,993
But the strangulation mark is inside the wet suit.

228
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:05,793
So what?

229
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,693
She was up against the rough sea.

230
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,093
The cord could've gotten inside her wet suit!

231
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,831
But the suit is tightly close to the body

232
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,393
so that water doesn't go inside it, you know.

233
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:18,837
What a nuisance! Now, get out of here, brat.

234
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:22,093
And, although the boat got lost,

235
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,843
Nagisa found her way back to this beach

236
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,493
where her beloved husband, Mr. Imaoka is!

237
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:28,847
Very sharp of you.

238
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,849
What sharp power of observation.

239
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,493
Huh? Her pedicure isn't complete.

240
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:36,855
True.

241
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:40,859
I wonder if she went to the beach in the midst of doing pedicure.

242
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:43,793
What's this? Something's not...

243
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,293
Mr. Imaoka!

244
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:50,869
Nagisa's been washed up on the beach!

245
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,993
Mr. Imaoka!

246
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:57,593
Those plastic bags!

247
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,593
So this is homicide after all!

248
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:13,193
And the culprit is...

249
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:22,901
Huh? The footprints of a person weighing more than 100 kilograms?

250
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:26,393
Yup, for example, if a person weighing 60 kilograms

251
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,907
carries a person weighing 50 kilograms on his back,

252
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,593
a deep footprint would remain, right?

253
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:33,793
Beats me.

254
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:35,293
Either way,

255
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:38,393
when we got here, there were no such footprints,

256
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,293
and it was just a beautiful sandy beach.

257
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,393
I see, thank you.

258
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,293
You're welcome.

259
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:45,693
Darn.

260
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,393
I'm sure that he's the culprit

261
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:51,993
but how did he carry the corpse to the beach?

262
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,393
I've got to figure that out first.

263
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:58,693
What's this?

264
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:01,393
Was it crushed by something?

265
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:05,393
It was crushed by something...

266
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,093
Could it be that...

267
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,993
I found it!

268
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:33,593
I see! So, that's the story.

269
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,977
Nagisa was embraced by the sea.

270
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,093
Yes.

271
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:42,393
And journeyed off.

272
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,593
Let's think of it that way...

273
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,593
Dad?

274
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,693
This is...

275
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,793
That's what I'd like to say,

276
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,993
but this is a homicide made to look like an accident.

277
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,293
What? Homicide?

278
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:03,293
Yes, that's right.

279
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:07,005
Please look at Nagisa's left toenail.

280
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,993
The pedicure is only halfway through, isn't it?

281
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,093
Don't you think it strange that she would go out to sea

282
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:14,093
while she was still partway through?

283
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:15,493
True.

284
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:20,593
I thought it was strange when Conan mentioned it to me a while ago too.

285
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:25,023
She only stopped partway because she had no other choice.

286
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:30,293
Because she was killed

287
00:17:30,293 --> 00:17:33,793
while putting on a pedicure.

288
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,493
Mr. Imaoka.

289
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:37,393
By you!

290
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,793
Mr. Mouri, what're you talking about, out of the blue?

291
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:47,045
Please look at the strangulation mark on Nagisa's neck.

292
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:51,049
A part of his below her wet suit, is it not?

293
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:52,593
It's because

294
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,793
in order to make it look like an accident,

295
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:57,055
after you strangled her with the leash cord,

296
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,493
you put the wet suit back on her.

297
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:01,993
Please wait, Mr. Mouri.

298
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:04,093
You know too, don't you?

299
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:07,065
That a lot of strength is needed to wear a wet suit.

300
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:09,593
If Nagisa was already dead,

301
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,069
although the example is not in good taste,

302
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,693
she would be as soft as a devils tongue, wouldn't she?

303
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,493
How on earth could I have made Nagisa,

304
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,493
who was in that condition wear the wet suit?

305
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:22,593
Shall we try it, then?

306
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:26,193
Sakata, you're a corpse, so don't move.

307
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:29,087
-Yes, sir. -There!

308
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:33,091
It's true that the foot comes out without having to exert much strength.

309
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,893
There, now for the other side.

310
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:40,693
The plastic bag that is covering the foot eases the friction.

311
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:43,093
Please look at the trash container that Ran has brought.

312
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:47,393
The remains of the pedicure in the plastic bag.

313
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,093
It should match Nagisa's foot.

314
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,893
I see, I see.

315
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:54,293
So the culprit made her wear the wet suit using the plastic bag,

316
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:55,593
put her on the rubber boat,

317
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,793
and disposed of it off-shore.

318
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:01,119
Then, the body wash washed up to shore in the morning.

319
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:02,793
That's probably what happened.

320
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,293
Please wait.

321
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,693
Since when do you claim I took out the rubber boat?

322
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,193
Yesterday at sundown or at night.

323
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:11,393
Low atmospheric pressure was here,

324
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,593
and the sea was bellowing, you know.

325
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,393
The rubber boat would sink.

326
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:17,993
Then, maybe it was this morning

327
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,137
after the low atmospheric pressure passed,

328
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,139
and the sea calmed down?

329
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,141
Enough already!

330
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,793
It's a heavy boat with Nagisa on it, you know.

331
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:29,147
Where on the sandy beach are there tracks of a boat having been dragged?

332
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:31,149
Well...

333
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:35,593
Nagisa went out surfing yesterday at sundown into the rough sea,

334
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:37,155
and died.

335
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,793
And this morning,

336
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:42,093
she was washed up to this beach.

337
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:45,693
It's true that when we discovered Nagisa,

338
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:49,593
there were no footprints or anything on this vast beach.

339
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:53,171
Just as if she was washed up here by the sea.

340
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,173
However, Mr. Imaoka.

341
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,793
You looked at the plastic model on that shelf over there

342
00:19:57,793 --> 00:20:00,893
and thought up the trick that you used to commit this crime.

343
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,793
The plastic models?

344
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:06,193
You mean this.

345
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,693
The crane truck.

346
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:09,993
You stretched out the tip,

347
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:12,693
tied the corpse to the rope,

348
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,193
and swayed it to both sides like the pendulum of a clock

349
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:18,993
and cut it off where the movement hit maximum.

350
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:21,199
I'm sorry. Well, at any rate,

351
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,193
the deceased would fly through the air and fall into the sea.

352
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:26,593
There would be no footprints in the sand.

353
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,193
How is it, Mr. Mouri?

354
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,693
Wrong!

355
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,793
Mr. Imaoka,

356
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:35,213
after killing Nagisa,

357
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,693
you buried her into the sand and hid her.

358
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:40,793
The mail about the karaoke was what you had schemed.

359
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,093
And then, this morning,

360
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,093
you dug Nagisa out,

361
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:46,393
carried her on your back and moved her.

362
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:49,493
But, it's the weight of two people, you know.

363
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:51,229
Of course, you'd have to find footprints.

364
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:56,093
You used a certain thing so as not to leave footprints behind.

365
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:59,237
"Crawler" -Using the heavy machinery, the crawler, as a hint.

366
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:05,993
Mr. Imaoka, you connected this and made a loop, right?

367
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:07,693
I see.

368
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:10,893
You carried Nagisa on your back, went inside

369
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:13,251
and moved along the sandy beach.

370
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,493
Then, you left Nagisa there and returned.

371
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:19,893
Well? Am I wrong?

372
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:30,693
Last night, it was after all of you had left.

373
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:34,393
Nagisa... She said...

374
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,593
Tomorrow morning,

375
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:42,393
I'm going to meet him under the solitary pine tree.

376
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,993
Once I'm settled, I'll send you the divorce paper.

377
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:49,287
You have no intention of thinking it over?

378
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,293
What it comes down to is

379
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:55,293
what the world requires is either looks or money.

380
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,297
Please forget about me.

381
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:09,693
Nagisa married me only for the money.

382
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,993
Darn!

383
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,093
Now, the last 100m straight!

384
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:38,493
Tawaru Gitaka's being followed by...

385
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:41,193
Go, go for it!

386
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:43,401
Run for it! Run for it! Run for it!

387
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,403
Go and run for it!

388
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,693
Just as expected, a man who can't ride the waves

389
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:54,593
can't ride horses either.

390
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:57,093
Why does this happen to me?

391
00:23:57,093 --> 00:24:00,393
Gosh, I've had enough!

392
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,020
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,423
"Font".

394
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,180
He can't ride a winning horse, nor can he ride the waves.

395
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,940
So, I guess I'll just have to float on a boat.

396
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,900
Yes, yes.
