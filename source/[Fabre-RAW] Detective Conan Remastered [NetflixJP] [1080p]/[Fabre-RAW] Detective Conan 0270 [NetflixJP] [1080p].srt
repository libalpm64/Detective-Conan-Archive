1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,220
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,320
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,120
The mysterious case using a vase.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,120
Reenacting the scene of the Case.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,820
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,620
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,120
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,980
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,280
end up helping Mr. Morita look for the lost wristwatch

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,580
in place of Pops.

11
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,380
While we were looking for the wristwatch at Mr. Morita's condo,

12
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,480
Ms. Eiko Idezuki, a resident of the same condo comes over

13
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,180
and starts watching a movie in the audio room.

14
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,580
In the meantime,

15
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,580
we found the wristwatch in the washing machine!

16
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,180
Just then...

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,680
We heard the flower vase crack from the audio!

18
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,280
We rushed over to see what happened

19
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,180
and found Ms. Idezuki hit on the head with the flower vase

20
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,980
and killed!

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
The killer is most likely Mr. Morita.

22
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,280
However, he has an alibi

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
and it would've been impossible for him to commit the crime.

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,980
How did he do it?

25
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
And, there's one more thing that bothers me.

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,380
It seems that someone is secretly checking up on Mr. Mouri.

27
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,480
We found that the investigation records

28
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
that Mr. Mouri handled up within town were all disappeared

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,180
from the police department.

30
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,280
And, when did the papers disappear?

31
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,880
I think it was...

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,580
the day when you and the others got messed up in a bus-jack.

33
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,880
No, the one they're after is not Pops,

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,280
but maybe...

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,280
And maybe they are...

36
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,380
"Forgotten Keepsake of a Crime (Part 2)"

37
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,980
Shinichi, what did Officer Takagi say?

38
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,080
It's nothing important.

39
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,180
Just as I thought,

40
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,780
you refuse to tell us anything.

41
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,780
Come off it, the same to you.

42
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,780
I guess so.

43
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,780
What's this? Are you hiding something after all, Shinichi?

44
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,180
No, that's not it.

45
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,480
Although he doesn't think of what will happen

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,880
when he is pushed forward by justice and pursues only the truth at times,

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
he yet at times, takes on all the pressure alone,

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,180
so as not to hurt anybody.

49
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,280
That character of yours, boyish and dangerous.

50
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,880
It's extremely interesting.

51
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,880
But I wonder if you're at all aware

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,980
that the pure fragrance of yours

53
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,280
is binding all the girls, including me

54
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,280
as well as yourself up in an isolated and dangerous fragrance.

55
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,980
Kudo.

56
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,080
Hey.

57
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,980
Don't you smell something odd?

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Now that you mentioned it, it does smell like something is burning.

59
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,680
Maybe it's the microwave oven over there?

60
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,780
There's no mistake about it, the smell's coming from in here!

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,180
But, there's nothing inside.

62
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,180
Conan?

63
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,880
This is dried flower, isn't it?

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,380
Or it was thrown away because it withered.

65
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,980
If so, that should be somewhere near here.

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,480
Darn, where is it?

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,680
It's impossible to hide anything so conspicuous away so easily.

68
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,580
Don't tell me it's in another room?

69
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,280
There are some more sandwiches left!

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,880
May I eat this?

71
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Gosh, Genta, you're such a pig.

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Sandwich?

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
Wait a second.

74
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,180
Maybe...

75
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
I found it!

76
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,080
I found it! This was a trick after all!

77
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,980
Which means that inside the audio room...

78
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,480
What is it, Conan?

79
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,680
I was playing flying a paper plane in the afternoon

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,980
and it went on top there.

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,180
Where?

82
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,980
Behind the curtain above the television!

83
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,480
Will you please get it for me, please?

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Okay... I'll get it for you now.

85
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,480
Gosh. Sometimes he acts really intelligent,

86
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
but sometimes he acts like any other kid.

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
There's nothing here, Conan.

88
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,980
There's no sign of an airplane anywhere.

89
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,680
It's full of machines!

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,980
It's amazing!

91
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,380
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

92
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
Put him down quick!

93
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,680
You sure have a lot of decks, don't you?

95
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,480
Yes, I put all the decks that have gotten old

96
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
and out of use on the top shelves.

97
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
Conan?

98
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
A timer?

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,980
Come down, Conan!

100
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,180
I see. So that's what it was.

101
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,980
Ms. Idezuki was watching unaware whatsoever

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,580
that this would be the last movie that she would be watching.

103
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,980
That she was going to be

104
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,880
a part of the ruthless story

105
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,180
that Mr. Morita had schemed.

106
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,980
"Mouri Detective Agency"

107
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,080
It's strange.

108
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,080
They didn't mention about going out or anything.

109
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Hey, I told them!

110
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,180
Okay, and what did Inspector Megure say?

111
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,080
He says it's an interesting deduction,

112
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,180
so he'll cooperate!

113
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,380
Okay! Next, it's you guys then!

114
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,180
Do exactly as I told you, now!

115
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,980
Okay...

116
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,430
You sure look worried.

117
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,930
You're worried about your precious girl, aren't you?

118
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,330
It's okay. I don't know what Officer Takagi told you,

119
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,930
but just make sure that you don't blow your cool

120
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,530
and reveal your identity or anything about the organization to her.

121
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,130
Well, I can see that your feet are off the ground

122
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,230
after receiving chocolate from her because after all you are a guy.

123
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,830
Come on! My feet are not off the ground.

124
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,530
I haven't told her a thing.

125
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,930
What?

126
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,930
But Shinichi, you accepted the chocolate from Ran, didn't you?

127
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,930
Yes.

128
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,530
Then you must've something in return for it...

129
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,530
She would want to see me.

130
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,730
If I say anything now,

131
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,930
she is going to miss me even more.

132
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,030
The hateful guy is just one-sidedly telling her

133
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,530
to wait for him

134
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,230
and can't even appear before her.

135
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,830
I don't want to see her cry anymore.

136
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,830
Even if it means blotting my existence out of her.

137
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,230
I'm so childish, what a laugh.

138
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,830
It hurts, doesn't it? The feeling's mutual.

139
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,930
What? Something was stolen?

140
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,230
Really?

141
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,830
It's true!

142
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,830
A strange thing disappeared!

143
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,530
The killer was actually a thief!

144
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,730
Please come to the kitchen.

145
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,230
Let's go, Mr. Morita.

146
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,930
Yes.

147
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,730
And? What is it that was stolen?

148
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,230
It's this!

149
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,630
A bowl?

150
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,530
No! It isn't the bowl that was stolen

151
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,130
but the bottom of the bowl!

152
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,030
See!

153
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,530
The bottom of the bowl with the same pattern of that bowl is there,

154
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,730
but the bottom of this bowl is gone, right?

155
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,630
True.

156
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,730
The bottom of that bowl was gone when I bought it.

157
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,330
It seems to have been a detective item.

158
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,830
Inspector! Everything's ready!

159
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,230
Ready?

160
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,730
If it's okay with you, we'd like you to stand witness too!

161
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,230
It's just a simple on-site investigation.

162
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,730
What? Okay.

163
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,730
Shall we go then?

164
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,430
To the audio room where Ms. Idesuki was struck to death

165
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,430
with the flower vase.

166
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,030
Please go ahead inside.

167
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,430
Yes.

168
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,030
The switch...

169
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,130
The switch of the video deck is on?

170
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,130
Is something wrong with the video deck on the shelf?

171
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,230
No, it's not the deck,

172
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,330
it's the stack of video tapes in front of it.

173
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,330
Excuse me. I put it there!

174
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,930
Because there're so many of them.

175
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:55,230
Well, the victim Ms. Idezuki rewound the video after watching it.

176
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,430
When she took it out of the deck,

177
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,030
she was attacked from behind by the killer, right?

178
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,830
Yes.

179
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,530
So, shall we use the video like she did

180
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,830
and replay the scene of the crime?

181
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,230
What?

182
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,030
Officer Takagi, you play the role of the killer.

183
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,730
Dr. Agasa, please play the role of the victim.

184
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,130
Well...

185
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,130
What? Anything?

186
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,530
Well, you see...

187
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,530
I... I'll do it!

188
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,930
Since Ms. Idezuki used to watch the video a lot in this room,

189
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,930
I think that a person who is familiar with this room is more appropriate.

190
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,730
It's that right!

191
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,230
Then, please do, by all means!

192
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,230
First, you insert the video tape into the video deck on the very bottom.

193
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,430
The victim sits in the chair and watches the movie all alone.

194
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,530
Is that right?

195
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,430
Yes.

196
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,430
Then the victim who finishes watching the video

197
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,230
rewinds the tape.

198
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,330
What's the matter?

199
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,330
Please rewind the tape!

200
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,730
Yes, sir!

201
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,030
While the tape is being rewound, the killer sneaks up behind her

202
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,930
with the flower vase that is at the front entrance.

203
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,430
And, as she is about to take the tape that is rewound out of the deck...

204
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,930
The killer flings up the flower vase.

205
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,530
Mr. Morita, quick, please take the tape out!

206
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,030
Yes... Yes!

207
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,430
Okay.

208
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,730
Well...

209
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,430
Why don't you use the remote controller?

210
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,830
-What? -Look!

211
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,730
The remote controller that you're holding

212
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,130
has an eject button!

213
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,730
That's...

214
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,530
I'll eject it for you then!

215
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
The video tape won't come falling

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,580
because the code number for the remote controller

217
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,580
for the video deck on the top shelf had been switched.

218
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
In other words, Mr. Morita,

219
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,180
this is how you committed the crime!

220
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,580
You rigged it so that the video deck you've been using on the lower shelf

221
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,480
and the video deck on the upper shelf

222
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,180
would operate with the same remote controller.

223
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,280
Then you put the tape in the video deck on the upper shelf.

224
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,580
Then you put the vase with the flower and water in it

225
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,180
in front of the eject slot of that tape deck.

226
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,280
Of course, you made sure it would fall by putting a tape under it!

227
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,780
After that, all you had to do

228
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,580
was close the curtain of that shelf to complete the scheme!

229
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,980
Then you showed Ms Idezuki the video

230
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,680
that she had been wanting to see

231
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,980
and lured her into this room.

232
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,780
If you tell her to rewind the tape

233
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,480
and return it to the video shop,

234
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,280
you knew that after she finishes watching the video,

235
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,780
she would use the remote controller to eject the tape

236
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,080
and at the same time,

237
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
the tape on the top shelf would also be ejected

238
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,780
and push the flower vase forward...

239
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,080
Just when she pulls the tape out of the deck,

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,480
the flower vase would come falling towards her.

241
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
In other words, so long as you were aware of her actions

242
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,580
when she frequented this room,

243
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,980
it wouldn't be difficult for you to set the timing right

244
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,280
so that the flower vase would fall on her!

245
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,580
Like so!

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,780
And the video deck on the top shelf had a function

247
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,780
that would push the tape back into the deck.

248
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,280
If it bumps into something,

249
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,880
so if you pre-record something into that tape

250
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
and break off the pin to prevent further recording,

251
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,480
the tape will automatically start to play.

252
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Therefore, right after the flower vase falls on her,

253
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,580
the sound of footsteps of someone running

254
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,680
and the door closing would be heard,

255
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,880
making it look like someone from outside committed the crime!

256
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,880
We heard it very clearly

257
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,880
because she was watching the movie full blast.

258
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,580
You made her use the deck on the very bottom

259
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,380
to get the vase to fall from as high a distance as possible.

260
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,780
You rigged it so the video deck on the top shelf

261
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,280
would switch off with a timer

262
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,680
so that when the police opened the curtain,

263
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,480
you wouldn't be suspected, right?

264
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,080
I guess you already know that we've seen through your scheme.

265
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,580
But, the flower vase that you had at the front entrance...

266
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,080
It was this bowl!

267
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,880
You glued it together like sandwich

268
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,980
and put it on the counter of the front entrance, right?

269
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,780
You carried it secretly over to the kitchen

270
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,680
when you went to make the sandwiches,

271
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,280
disassembled it and hid it between the bowls!

272
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,480
These are the flowers that were inside the vase.

273
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,280
You dried it using the microwave oven and threw them away.

274
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,680
Poor thing, after your wife decorated the flowers there.

275
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
My wife didn't arrange those flowers.

276
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,780
Those flowers are out of place flowers

277
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,080
that the woman brought to my wife's funeral.

278
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,180
We didn't even have the money to buy flowers in this house anymore.

279
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,580
Stocks.

280
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,280
That woman urged my wife to do stocks behind my back.

281
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,380
She was eventually buried in debts and was driven to death.

282
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,480
Which means your wife's car accident...

283
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,280
Yes, the day after she told me about the stocks,

284
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
she ran in front of car and got run over.

285
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,080
That wristwatch was wrapped in a letter that she had written to me.

286
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,580
It said, "I don't want this to destroyed,"

287
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,080
"so I'm leaving this behind."

288
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
So...

289
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,380
Who cares whether the flowers that woman gave me

290
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,580
are withered or burned?

291
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,680
We'll hear the rest of your story out at the station.

292
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,480
But, I feel sorry for them nevertheless.

293
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,480
They were so beautiful

294
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,480
and flowers have such short lives.

295
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,380
They were forced to wither before their time came.

296
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,480
Yes.

297
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm going to head on home then!

298
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,580
Yes,

299
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,080
flowers are fragile and short-lived.

300
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
No matter how much we try to protect them

301
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,780
from rain and wind and build fences around them,

302
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,980
flowers will wither in want of the sun.

303
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,680
If a storm comes,

304
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,080
a fragile fence cannot act as a shield at all.

305
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,480
Do you understand this, Kudo?

306
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,580
Darn! How come nobody's answering the phone?

307
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,880
Darn!

308
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,780
Ran, Pops!

309
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,980
Help!

310
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,780
I got you!

311
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,580
-Help! Somebody! -Right, it's dinner time.

312
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,580
-Nobody's going to come to help you! -They may be at home upstairs.

313
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
Ran!

314
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,280
Ran!

315
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,580
Dinner made part way.

316
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,880
The television in the office is left on.

317
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,980
Don't tell me that...

318
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,480
It seems that someone is secretly checking up on Mr. Mouri.

319
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,780
Don't tell me that...

320
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
the person...

321
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,180
Who is it?

322
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,380
Ran.

323
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,980
Bingo!

324
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,480
Hey... Where were you?

325
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,680
I went to the supermarket on second street!

326
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,580
Dad had a big win with the horse race!

327
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,080
A big win?

328
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,880
Dad was elated and said,

329
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,580
"We're having steak tonight! Go buy the meat and sake!"

330
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,880
That's why I left everything part way

331
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,980
and rushed over to go shopping!

332
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,480
Because unless I go right away,

333
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,180
the sell-out of meat all the time.

334
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,080
Where's Pops?

335
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,980
I think he's going around the neighbourhood boasting about his win.

336
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,880
Hold on just a while longer, Conan.

337
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,880
I'll make you a steak that's even more delicious

338
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,880
than that of first rate restaurants!

339
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,980
Ran.

340
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,280
What?

341
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,080
Well...

342
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,280
The man wearing a black knitted cap

343
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,980
maybe an acquaintance of mine.

344
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,780
What is it?

345
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,280
Black...

346
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,280
Black...

347
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,880
Don't burn the meat black.

348
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
How rude!

349
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,980
You can count on me!

350
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,980
I don't believe she knows him.

351
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,880
"Mouri Detective Agency"

352
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,360
Next Conan's hint:

353
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,320
"Circle, cross and triangle"
