1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,970
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,870
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,670
Ayumi and granny.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,670
Solving both the code and the case!

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,520
Ayumi?

9
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,820
Well... That figures.

10
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,220
Yes. I'm sure of it.

11
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,920
She's not hanging around with us anymore.

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,220
Looks like she's meeting somebody named

13
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,420
Bruce or Jackie in that park every day.

14
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,020
Seems she has a foreigner boyfriend.

15
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,220
And you want to go to see them?

16
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
That would be too nosy isn't it?

17
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,320
It's not being nosy!

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,220
We must investigate

19
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,620
whether the person deserves seeing Ayumi!

20
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,420
Conan, you have to come with us.

21
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,820
No, thanks.

22
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Conan! This is serious matter

23
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,620
that can affect her entire life!

24
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,720
Hey, hey isn't that a bit too far-fetched?

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,320
"Riddle Granny Disappearance Case"

26
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,720
Who's that old woman?

27
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,620
The character "Ta" for rice paddy?

28
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,520
Yes, with four matchsticks.

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,420
The character "Ta"...

30
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,620
Can I bend one?

31
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,020
No, Ayumi...

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,520
I give up! How do you do it?

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,220
Here, let me do it.

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,820
See?

35
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,420
It is!

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
It's the character "Ta"!

37
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
You see.

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,420
This quiz was in this book, too.

39
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,720
Sounds interesting!

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,620
I'll lend it to you some time.

41
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,120
Now...

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,920
What in the world are they doing?

43

Here you are!

44
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,720
Looks like your leg is so much better, Jackie.

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
Jackie?

A little more time for your skin to cure.

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,520
Ayumi, will you put the ointment on Steve?

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,620
Steve?

50
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,220
Steve, don't move! Stay still!

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Jackie and Steve were cats!

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,120
Gosh. So much worry for nothing.

53
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,620
I knew it was something like that!

54
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,120
Bruce! What's the matter?

55
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320

I hear you! You don't have to shout.

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,120
It was inside the hood of my car again!

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
Plus pee all over it!

60
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
It's all your fault! You taking care of these good-for-nothings!

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,020
Leave them alone!

62
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,820
You shouldn't talk like that!

63
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,120
On top of that, your car is parked in a no-parking zone.

64

On top of that, your car is parked in no-parking zone.

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Don't make a big fuss over cat pee!

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Shut up! Do you want to take the cat's place

67
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,020
and be taught a lesson?

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,220
What kind of lesson?

69
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,120
Show it to me!

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,520
-You... -Stop!

71
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
What are you kids?

We're the Youth Detective Squad!

Leave old ladies alone!

74
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,520
Granny,

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,620
if you let the cat under the hood one more time,

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,520
you'll pay for it!

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,820
Bruce!

78
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,220
How many times do I have to tell you not to get inside the hood?

79
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,120
You naughty boy!

80
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,520
So cute.

81
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,820
Thank you so much, boys!

82
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,520
Really! You guys were so brave!

83
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
I was impressed!

84
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,620
Standing up for the homeless cats!

85
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,620
It's not something everyone can do!

86
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,320
Yeah, Granny is like a god for these cats

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,920
A god? No way, kids.

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,620
I don't deserve that.

89
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,420
I am a miserable being not worthy of them.

90
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,020
Are they all abandoned cats?

91
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Yes, abandoned because of human whim.

92
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,620
Mrs. Omori is taking care of them

93
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,120
while looking for people who are willing to take them.

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm just helping her out.

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,620
Ayumi, why didn't you tell us?

96
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,120
We are the members of the Youth Detective Squad!

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,820
The Youth Detective Squad?

98
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,420
Yeah, we've solved mystery cases together.

99
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,720
Is that right? Mysteries.

100
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,320
Something troubling you, Grans?

101
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,720
Well, nothing.

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Oh, yes, Ayumi. Will you...

103
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,820
please keep this for me?

104
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,120
What? But, why?

105
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Oh, I may not come tomorrow.

106
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,820
You know, my arthritis hurts.

107
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,320
Arthritis?

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,120
I know a hot springs place that is good for arthritis.

109
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,820
Hot springs?

110
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,120
I used to go to the hot springs in Izu before.

111
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
Oh, why not?

112
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,420
There is an inn I know well.

113
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm pretty sure they're safe with Ayumi.

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Okay, see you tomorrow!

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Bye! Granny!

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,320
Be careful on your way home.

117
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,820
I don't see Bruce.

118
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,120
He's probably dozing off in the warm sunshine.

119
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,020
Granny is late.

120
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,120
She should be here by now.

121
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,420
Maybe she went to the hot springs.

122
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,120
Remember, she was complaining about arthritis yesterday.

123
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,820
I wonder...

124
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,820
She is not the type to leave the cats she love neglected.

125
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,620
Is she in trouble?

126
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,520
Like suddenly becoming ill.

127
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,820
Let's go check her place!

128
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,620
What do you think, Conan?

129
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,820
Let's go.

130
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,220
There is something that had been nagging me yesterday.

131
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,120
Granny! It's me, Ayumi!

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,620
Are you there?

133
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,720
Granny, it's Ayumi!

134
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,620
Granny...

135
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,620
Where has she gone?

136
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,020
Did something happen after we left?

137
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,520
You're been overly concerned.

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,620
But that man said he's going to make her pay.

139
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,920
That's all bluff!

140
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,720
Funny.

141
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,320
The evening paper is still in the box.

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
That means, she hasn't been back here!

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,220
What! She hasn't been back!

144
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,620
Still, it's pretty difficult to imagine that

145
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,020
she left immediately for hot springs.

146
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,420
Something must have happened!

147
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,920
Anyway, call the fire department, Ayumi.

148
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,220
Mitsuhiko, call the police

149
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,020
and ask whether they have a person named Shizuka Ohmori

150
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,220
who either got involved in an accident

151
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,320
or was carried by an ambulance to a hospital.

152
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,920
Genta, check out who the man we saw yesterday is.

153
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,820
But how?

154
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,220
Looks like he's always illegally parked.

155
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,520
Someone in this area may have seen him.

156
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,320
I'll check around the neighborhood

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
to find somebody who knows the old lady!

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad to battle stations!

159
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,320
Go!

160
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,320
I don't deserve that.

161
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,120
I am a miserable being not worthy of them.

162
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,720
I hope what I'm thinking turns out wrong.

163
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,720
I've known Shizuka for a very long time,

164
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,620
and I don't think she have friends or relations

165
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,820
she can stay with.

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,620
That is why she can't resist taking care of those cats.

167
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
She's had her fill of trouble

168
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,620
and probably went to the hot springs

169
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,520
for some relaxation.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,920
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

171
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,020
"Setsuko Nishiyoma (62)" -There's a house close to the park,

172
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,320
which belonged to an old man named Ezaki.

173
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,520
Shizuka was taking care of him.

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,220
But, about a month ago...

175
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,520
Poor Mr. Ezaki.

176
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,820
He fell over in the bathtub

177
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,020
and hit his head very hard and passed away.

178
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,220
It looked like he was set up

179
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,620
to fall on the faucet

180
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,320
even though it was an accident.

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,120
So, that's why Shizuka became lonely.

182
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
When Mr. Ezaki was still alive,

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,220
she called him Master Ezaki

184
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,820
She always take him to hot springs

185
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,720
and take good care of him.

186
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,220
Hot springs in Izu.

187
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,620
Do you know where they stayed in Izu?

188
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,520
Oh she hasn't told me.

189
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,220
Maybe you can find that out at Mr. Ezaki's house.

190
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,420
Hasn't he died?

191
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,120
His nephew lives there now.

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,620
His name is Mr. Mochizuki.

193
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,520
I heard that he owns a company in Haitocho.

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,820
This is it! We got it, Conan!

195
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,320
The hot springs town in Izu

196
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,020
that she frequented with Mr. Ezaki...

197
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,920
she probably became nostalgic and went there.

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Because we couldn't find her name

199
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,420
among those involved in traffic accidents

200
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,820
or criminal cases.

201
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,820
The hot spring resort

202
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,220
"Toshio Mochizuki (50)" -that Uncle and Shizuka frequented?

203
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,620
Yes, do you know where they used to stay in Izu?

204
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,120
Mr. Mochizuki,

205
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,020
do you want the locker moved out at two o'clock?

206
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,420
Yes, please do that.

207
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,020
The door is locked tight,

208
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,420
and it contains things.

209
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,020
But it's all junk inside.

210
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,120
Please throw it away.

211
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,420
All right. I'll be back.

212
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,620
Hot springs in Izu.

213
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,820
I haven't heard of any favorite inn.

214
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,920
Don't worry, she'll be back soon.

215
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,420
Is that right?

216
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,720
There are so many monkey figurines here.

217
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
Oh, yes.

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
They are all part of Uncle's collection.

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, that's "The Three Monkeys."

220
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,820
Hey, you're pretty smart.

221
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,220
"See no evil, speaking no evil, hear no evil"

222
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,320
That means don't get involved in matters

223
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
that are of no concern to you.

224
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,120
I've been asking people all over,

225
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,620
but I couldn't find who he was.

226
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,320
I'll call hotels and inns in Izu!

227
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,720
All over Izu?

228
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,520
There are thousands and thousands!

229
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,020
But I can't just sit here.

230
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,020
I want to know whether she's safe or not.

231
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
Hey, it's Bruce.

232
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
What!

233
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,220
Bruce?

234
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,120
It is! It is Bruce!

235
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,020
Bruce!

236
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Bruce! We're in trouble!

237
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,120
Granny's gone!

238
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,520
The scarf...

239
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,720
What is it, Ayumi?

240
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,120
Bruce has Granny's scarf around his neck.

241
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,620
See?

242
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,720
It is!

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,020
That means, he's with Mrs. Ohmori!

244
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,120
Wait! There is something written on the scarf!

245
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,420
I see eight characters on it.

246
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,820
Hey... What is that stain there?

247
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,620
This is...

248
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,820
Blood stain!

249
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,520
What?

250
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,870
What?

251
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,370
Granny's been abducted and held?

252
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,470
She hasn't gone to the hot springs in Izu?

253
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,570
No.

254
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,270
She tied the scarf with bloodstain around Bruce.

255
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,570
That means she's being held somewhere.

256
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,570
But, it means that she's hurt and can't move, right?

257
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,670
Then, she'd be writing where she is being held.

258
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,670
The reason why she sent an encrypted message is...

259
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,170
Encrypted message?

260
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,270
I get it!

261
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,070
She did it so that the culprit won't be able to understand,

262
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,270
if it ever should be found.

263
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,370
That means that we must decipher the message, right?

264
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,170
I've seen this somewhere.

265
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,170
What?

266
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,270
What? You've seen it?

267
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,970
Granny used to give me quizzes

268
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,570
before calling the cats.

269
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,870
One of them was

270
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,170
a quiz about creating new Kanji characters

271
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,070
from this character by adding one more stroke.

272
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,470
A quiz!

273
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,370
Mitsuhiko, can you guess?

274
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,170
Well..

275
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,070
Add one in the center, and you get "Me" for eyes.

276
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,870
One vertical line and you get "Ta" for the rice field.

277
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,070
Add a short one at the top and you get "Shiro" for white.

278
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,870
Come on, Mitsuhiko.

279
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,370
Anything else, Conan?

280
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,770
"Kyu". "Yoshi".

281
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,770
"Kou". "Tan". "Shin".

282
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,770
"Kyu". "Yoshi".

283
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,270
"Kou". "Tan". "Shin".

284
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,770
Oh, sorry.

285
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,370
I forget I'll write them down.

286
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,570
The characters from left

287
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,970
are "Me", "Shiro",

288
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,470
"Ta", "Kyu"

289
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,070
"Yoshi", "Kou",

290
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,770
"Tan", "Shin".

291
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,270
Where did you get to learn them?

292
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,570
These tell us where she is being held?

293
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,370
The first three...

294
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,670
Do they mean some paddy in Mejiro?

295
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,170
Are there rice paddies in Mejiro?

296
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,670
Well...

297
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,170
I get it!

298
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,070
The paddy became all white with snow!

299
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,670
And then?

300
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,270
Then...

301
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,570
It's so bright it hurts your eyes!

302
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,370
That's no clue to finding a place!

303
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,170
How about you? Can't you think of anything?

304
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,670
Me?

305
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,920
"Meshirotakyuyoshikoutanshin"!

306
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,820
You're just reading them in order!

307
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,020
Anyway, we need to find out

308
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,820
the meaning of the last five characters.

309
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,720
Or else, we're getting nowhere.

310
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,120
The first character, "Kyu" is used to mean old.

311
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,220
The next "Yoshi" is a character used for the word motive.

312
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,920
That suggests the cause or reason.

313
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,220
"Kou" suggests the turtle shell.

314
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,320
"Tan" symbolizes the sun rising in the horizon,

315
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,720
so it suggests sunrise or morning.

316
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,820
I've seen that one.

317
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
I saw it in New Year greeting cards!

318
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,120
Right, as in the word New Year.

319
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,520
It actually refers to the daybreak of New Year's Day.

320
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
New Year greetings?

321
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,820
Then that means the last character "Shin" suggests

322
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,120
the "monkey"?

323
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,420
Monkey?

324
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Yeah.

325
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,720
The character is used to symbolize the Monkey,

326
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,620
as in the Year of the Monkey.

327
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,420
Then, that suggests someone born

328
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,920
in the Year of the Monkey?

329
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,220
Well... Conan.

330
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,120
That character "Tan"

331
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,620
Doesn't that read "Dan", too?

332
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,620
What? As in "Dan" meaning master?

333
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
I see!

334
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,320
Yes. You told us

335
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Granny used to call Mr. Ezaki, Master Ezaki.

336
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,520
Right.

337
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,020
That means these two point

338
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,320
to the "old" or "former", "master"

339
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,320
that is, Mr. Ezaki!

340
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
But I thought granny wanted to tell us where she's locked?

341
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,920
No. It doesn't seem like it.

342
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,720
Do you remember her saying she doesn't deserve this,

343
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,920
that she's a miserable being?

344
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,620
I am a miserable being not worthy of them.

345
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,920
So, that means that she wasn't just being humble about herself?

346
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,820
Right most probably she learned a secret about Mr. Ezaki

347
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,720
and was abducted because of that.

348
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
And she sent the information

349
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,620
in this encrypted message.

350
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,320
Conan.

351
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,020
Doesn't the character "Ta"

352
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,220
is a combination of the character "kuchi" (mouth) with a cross in it?

353
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,420
Yeah.

354
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,320
Then, this character

355
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,220
must be a mouth with a cross meaning,

356
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,920
"Don't tell anyone".

357
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,020
No, that's not it.

358
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,120
This means "make her silent".

359
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,020
That means "murder"!

360
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,320
What!

361
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,520
I'll show you.

362
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,820
If you put them in this order...

363
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,220
The reason why the former master was murdered...

364
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,920
That means Mr. Ezaki didn't die because of an accident!

365
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,720
He was killed!

366
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,520
And the remaining four characters

367
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
suggest the cause or the weapon!

368
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,920
The four are

369
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,020
"Me", "Shiro",

370
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,620
"Kou" and "Shin"...

371
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,820
"Me", "Shiro", "Kou" and "Shin".

372
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,420
"Koushin"!

373
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,020
Yes!

374
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,320
"Koushin" is just phonetic!

375
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,920
What? You mean "Koushin" points to "Koushinto"?

376
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,620
Come to think of it, there is a shopping street

377
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,420
on the other side of the tracks named Koushin.

378
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,320
Yeah. Then, maybe someone there!

379
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,120
No. It's not like that.

380
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,420
Koushinto that Mitsuhiko suggested

381
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,720
frequently has a certain drawing on it.

382
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
What drawing?

383
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,420
The Three Monkeys.

384
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,120
You mean the Three Monkeys

385
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,620
who "see no evil, speak no evil and hear no evil"?

386
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,920
That means!

387
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
You're right.

388
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
The Three Monkeys figurine we saw at Mr. Ezaki's house.

389
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,920
That was the murder weapon.

390
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
Wait.

391
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Then, what do "Me" and "Shiro" suggest?

392
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,720
Remember how the figurine look like?

393
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,820
I got it! The Three Monkeys with white eyes!

394
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Right.

395
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,520
Then, the culprit is that guy Mochizuki?

396
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,920
Most probably.

397
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,020
Anyway, we don't have time.

398
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,720
Granny will be moved out of the house at 2 pm.

399
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,120
What? You know where she is?

400
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,520
Certain as I can be.

401
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,820
We alerted the police with our report,

402
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,020
We were able to rescue granny from the locker

403
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,220
that was about to be moved out of the house.

404
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,820
With her testimony,

405
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,520
Mr. Ezaki's blood was found on the figurine.

406
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,620
And Mr. Mochizuki was arrested for murder,

407
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,020
abduction and illegal detention.

408
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,020
Granny Shizuka seems completely recovered and happy.

409
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,020
She's back taking care of the cats.

410
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,320
Great!

411
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,520
Hey, that man...

412
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Isn't that the guy who threatened Granny the other day?

413
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,420
Yes.

414
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,120
Why is he apologizing to her?

415
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,320
What's going on, Ayumi?

416
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Why is he apologizing?

417
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,320
That man almost had his car stolen.

418
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,820
What?

419
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,320
When the burglar was trying to steal the car,

420
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,120
Bruce meowed inside the car, surprising him.

421
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,220
He tried to check what was wrong inside.

422
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
While he was doing that,

423
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,020
the guy came back and prevented the burglary.

424
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,120
Really, I owe it to the cat named Bruce.

425
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,920
I was saved.

426
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
Thank you so much.

427
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,820
You were just defending your own bed, right, Bruce?

428
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,500
Next Conan Hint:

429
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,040
"Television screen"
