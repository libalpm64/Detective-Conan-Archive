1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,670
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,570
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,470
A Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament in Kumamoto.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,270
A cellphone's text message causes big trouble for Ran.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,970
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,010
"Mount Aso"

9
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,610
We are on board our plane flying to Kumamoto.

10
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,310
We headed there to enter a tennis match

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,310
that Genta won in a lottery.

12
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,410
Ran and Pops is with us as our guardian

13
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,110
and Sonoko has also come along paying her own way.

14
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,610
Just as would be expected of the daughter of the Suzuki financial group.

15
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,110
And, this time there is one more person who came along with us.

16
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,110
It's not usual for her to come along on something like this.

17
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,110
Want anything?

18
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,510
Oh, well, no.

19
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,910
Okay.

20
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,410
Usually you're not interested in these stuff and didn't join us,

21
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,310
so I was wondering why you tag along this time.

22
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,910
There's no special reason why I came along.

23
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,110
It's because Dr. Agasa kept bugging me to go.

24
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,310
And besides...

25
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,210
Unless I stay near you, you can't protect me, can you?

26
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,710
Only joking.

27
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,010
Oh boy.

31
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,910
Here we are.

32
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,410
It's Kyushu!

33
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,110
It's Kumamoto!

34
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,810
Shochu liquor!

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,110
Just as expected of your dad, Ran.

36
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,710
Come on, dad.

37
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,010
Let's hurry and rent a car and go to the hotel.

38
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,010
Hey.

39
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,810
-Hold it. -We bring to you

40
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,010
the Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament.

41
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,910
Playing the semi-finals will be,

42
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,110
-First match, -It's Kyohei Mabuchi.

43
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,510
-Kyohei Mabuchi a local of Kumamoto... -You're right.

44
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,910
-vs. America's Richard Woodbridge. -Awesome.

45
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,810
-The match will start from 11:00 am. -You're still kids.

46
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,010
-The second match will be played... -The one who's really awesome is...

47
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,310
by Masato Tachikawa, also a local of Kumamoto

48
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,810
-vs. Michael Owen of England, -Masahito!

49
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,410
which will begin at 2:00 pm.

50
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,410
We could never beat him, though.

51
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,310
Come on, Genta.

52
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,110
We're entering the junior match,

53
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,910
but they'reall professionals.

54
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,810
We would never end up playing those people.

55
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,110
Oh, really?

56
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,810
Right, Genta.

57
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,110
What a bummer.

58
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,610
I was kind of hoping to play against them.

59
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,110
"Ninomaru Park"

60
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,610
It so spacious and feels good.

61
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,310
Yeah.

62
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,310
Kids sure are active no matter what they do.

63
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,010
Really, training as soon as they get here.

64
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,310
It's so nice to be young.

65
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,310
You're talking like you're some middle-aged woman or something.

66
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,710
What are you doing, Genta?

67
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,710
I'm...

68
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,810
Let's rest a while.

69
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,410
Just what are you talking about?

70
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,410
The match is tomorrow.

71
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,010
We've come to Kumamoto to win.

72
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,510
But, where's Mr. Mouri?

73
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,810
You're right, Ai's not around either.

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,310
Well, I do have an idea where they are, though.

75
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,910
Spicy lotus root, raw horse meat and shochu liquor.

76
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,910
Viva Kumamoto.

77
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,710
I can't take it anymore.

78
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,210
Let's take a five minute break, then.

79
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,810
Only five minutes?

80
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,910
-Are you serious? -Of course.

81
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,010
Mitsuhiko, why don't we call it a day for training

82
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,710
and go look around since we've come all the way to Kumamoto.

83
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,810
Agreed. Agreed.

84
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,810
I'm starving too.

85
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,710
Hey, Mitsuhiko?

86
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,310
Besides, we don't want anybody to overwork themselves

87
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,910
and get hurt or something just before the match, do we?

88
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,510
But, Ran...

89
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,310
I know how you feel about wanting to win,

90
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,010
but participating in the game is what counts.

91
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,510
Have you ever heard this phrase?

92
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,810
I think it's more important to give it all we've got

93
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,610
and to try our best,

94
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,910
rather than we win the game or not.

95
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,210
Okay.

96
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,010
All right! Let's go eat eels over rice.

97
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,510
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,910
Pork bones noodle is what Kumamoto is famous for.

99
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,310
Ran.

100
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,810
You'll become a good mother.

"Suizenji Park"

103
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,310
What is it, Sonoko?

104
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,410
Look what I found.

105
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,910
Isn't that a cell phone?

106
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,910
We've got to turn it into the police right away.

107
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,910
Yeah.

108
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,410
It's vibrating.

109
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,410
Mail?

110
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,410
Yeah, I think so.

111
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,010
Shall we take a look at it?

112
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,510
No, we shouldn't peek into other people's mail.

113
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,010
Who cares?

114
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,310
Besides, it may be from the owner of this cell phone, right?

115
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,310
Hey, don't.

116
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,310
It says, "Sonoko. I want to see you."

117
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,310
It's a love mail.

118
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,310
You're blushed.

119
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,910
Hey, what's up, Sonoko?

120
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,010
Well...

121
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,110
It's nothing, really.

122
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,610
This is not kid's stuff.

123
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,610
You better watch out,

124
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,710
the police may scold you for looking at other people's mail.

125
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,910
Never mind. The other kids are waiting for you over there.

126
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,110
Hurry and go on over there.

127
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,110
At any rate, we've got to hurry and take it to the police.

128
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,810
What're you talking about?

129
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,810
We're going to deliver this in person tomorrow

130
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,410
to the person who sent this mail.

131
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,010
But, we've got the tennis match tomorrow.

132
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,210
Don't worry.

133
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,110
See, this Prefectural Athletic Park

134
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,210
is where the the tennis match is going to be held.

135
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,310
Oh, right.

136
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,310
See?

137
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,910
So, it won't hurt to leave for just a while.

138
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,510
I guess so.

139
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,010
That's it. Tomorrow we'll see how this love

140
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,010
as well as the tennis match goes.

141
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,710
Finally, tomorrow is the day.

142
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,210
Are going to be okay?

143
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,810
Yeah, of course.

144
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,510
I give you my word.

145
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,410
We will now begin

146
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,310
the First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament Junior Match.

147
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,010
Before the start of the game,

148
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,310
I, Kenzo Narimasu, Chairman of this tournament

149
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,110
would like to give a welcome speech

150
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,610
"Kenzo Narimasu (60)" -to the guardians of the contestants

151
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,210
"Congressman" -as well as all the spectators here.

152
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,410
I am being suspected at present

153
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,710
for something that I have no knowledge of whatsoever, but...

154
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,010
I swear to God that i am innocent...

155
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,910
-of all such dubious acts. -What's with that man?

156
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,410
He's talking about something irrelevant to tennis.

157
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,210
He looks awfully familiar, though.

158
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,310
You probably some him on TV.

159
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,810
He's Kenzo Narimasu,

160
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,710
a congressman who was elected

161
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,210
from Kumamoto that has recently been talked about a lot

162
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,810
regarding his corrupted acts.

163
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,110
Oh, yes, I've heard of him.

164
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,710
The other day, his secretary called Saiki took on all the guilt

165
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,810
and committed suicide, right?

166
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,010
Yeah.

167
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,910
So, in order to gain back his reputation with the public,

168
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,010
he offered to be sponsor for this tournament.

169
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,810
The usual stuff.

170
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,710
"The Youth Detective Squad 2 vs Little Kids Club 1"

171
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,010
"Gas Buzz 0 vs The Youth Detective Squad 2"

172
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,810
"The Youth Detective Squad 2 vs Kashiwa Boys 1"

173
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,610
"Takumi Club 0 vs The Youth Detective Squad 2"

174
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,210
We did it.

175
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,610
Really, I don't believe it.

176
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,910
Great victory for the Youth Detective Squad.

177
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,510
Good work and welcome back everybody.

178
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,010
Were you watching us, Ai?

179
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,410
Yes, you're all pretty good.

180
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,410
Now, we get to go on to the semi-finals.

181
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,910
We've already come this far.

182
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,110
Victory of the Youth Detective Squad!

183
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,710
Hey, where are Ran and Sonoko?

184
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,210
I wonder they went sneaking off just a while ago.

185
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,410
I see.

186
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,010
"Cafe Athlete"

187
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,110
There's nobody who looks to be the owner.

188
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,510
Nope.

189
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,010
Should we mail him?

190
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,910
Don't, Sonoko.

191
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,810
Just joking, only joking.

192
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,310
But, this is so exciting.

193
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,010
I think I kind of got too nervous

194
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,110
that I have to go to the ladies' room.

195
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,610
Sorry, Ran, I'll be right back.

196
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,010
Geez.

197
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,010
Sonoko sure is late.

198
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,110
Yeah, she wasn't for it to begin with so...

199
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,210
That's why we decided to meet and talk it out, right?

200
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,810
Yeah, but if Sonoko doesn't come...

201
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,610
If so, we wait outside until she succeeds

202
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,510
and run for it together.

203
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,410
After all, today's the only chance we got to kill that guy.

204
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,810
What shall I do? I've got to get somebody, quick.

205
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,110
Cell phone, cell phone. Where's my cell phone?

206
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,010
You heard us talking, didn't you?

207
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,110
"Akira Doi, Hideki Mamiya" -Hey, isn't that Sonoko's cell phone?

208
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,010
No doubt about it. It's Sonoko's.

209
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,310
How come you have it?

210
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,310
My friend picked it up so, I was going to return it...

211
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,910
You mean Sonoko dropped it?

212
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,310
Which means maybe she didn't read our mail.

213
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,010
Either way, we can't let you go, like this.

214
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,410
What the heck? So, you finally made it?

215
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,210
What should we do with this girl?

216
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,610
Just like Akira says,

217
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,810
we can't let her go as is.

218
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,910
Let's take her to the factory for now.

219
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,810
Yeah, I guess so.

220
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,010
What? Ran... Ran is gone?

221
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,010
Right, she disappeared while I was in the lady's room.

222
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,810
Are you sure she's not back at the hotel room sleeping?

223
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,010
I called and asked,

224
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,310
but was told she hasn't come back yet.

225
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,310
I wonder what happened.

226
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,310
That's cause for worry.

227
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,310
Hey, did you try calling her cell phone? Ran's cell phone?

228
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,910
Yes, but no one answered.

229
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,010
I wonder if she has it on manner mode

230
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,910
and doesn't know it's ringing. Or, it could be that...

231
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,310
Or, it could be that...

232
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,710
she's in a situation that she can't answer.

233
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,310
But, I can't tell if it's an accident or an incident.

234
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,610
Where is this?

235
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,010
Why am I here?

236
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,310
You heard us talking, didn't you?

237
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,110
Hey, isn't that Sonoko's cell phone?

238
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,710
No doubt about it. It's Sonoko's.

239
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,710
How come you have it?

240
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,310
You mean Sonoko dropped it?

241
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,110
Maybe I...

242
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,810
Don't tell she was kidnapped?

243
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,010
It can't be?

244
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,410
Hey, you guys.

245
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,010
What's with that bummed out look on your faces?

246
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,410
I get it, you guys lost?

247
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,910
No, it's not that.

248
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,410
Ran...

249
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,010
May have been kidnapped.

250
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,110
What?

251
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,310
There.

252
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,010
Hey, hold it.

253
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,610
Are you sure about this kidnap thing?

254
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,110
Maybe she's lost somewhere near here?

255
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,010
But, she's not answering her cell phone.

256
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,710
She's not back at the hotel either.

257
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,510
But that's not enough to go on...

258
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,110
It's from Ran.

259
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,610
See, how dare you worry me like that.

260
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,710
Hello. Ran, just where the heck are you now?

261
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,410
Sorry, Sonoko.

262
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,110
It's seems as if I've been kidnapped.

263
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,810
You've been kidnapped after all?

264
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,710
-What? -Lend it to me.

265
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,110
Hello, Ran.

266
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,310
Conan.

267
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,010
Do you know where you are?

268
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,510
Where?

269
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,710
It seems to be the locker room of an abandoned factory or something.

270
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,110
Can you look out the window?

271
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,010
Is there anythin that can serve as a hint to where you are?

272
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,510
Anything will do.

273
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,310
Okay, hold on.

274
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,910
How about it, Ran?

275
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,210
Sunflower.

276
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,710
Right, there are a lot of sunflowers in bloom here.

277
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,810
Anything else?

278
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,210
On the other side of the sunflowers

279
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,410
there is a building that is not in use.

280
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,810
There is a sign.

281
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,310
What's written on the sign?

282
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,910
Wait...

283
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,510
Hirukomachi.

284
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,810
Hirukomachi is what's written.

285
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,410
It's written with "bloodsucker" and "child" characters.

286
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,910
Okay. Hirukomachi, right?

287
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,510
And about the kidnappers?

288
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,510
The kidnappers are the ones who sent the mail to Sonoko.

289
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,510
The ones who mailed Sonoko?

290
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,810
Conan, please listen to me.

291
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,010
Those people were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

292
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,910
Hey, Ran. It's me.

293
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,210
Can you hear me?

294
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,610
Hey! Answer me, Ran!

295
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,910
The line's been cut.

296
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,310
Maybe the kidnappers found her talking on the phone?

297
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,410
What shall we do?

298
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,110
She could've contacted the police.

299
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,310
Maybe we should drop the whole idea after all.

300
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,110
No, we won't let anybody get in our way.

301
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,610
Not anybody.

302
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,510
Thank you for waiting.

303
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,210
I am Officer Tamana from the Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department.

304
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,110
This is Officer Kato.

305
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,210
Hello.

306
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,410
How do you do? I'm Kogoro Mouri.

307
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,610
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

308
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,210
Well, please sit down.

309
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,210
Thank you.

310
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,510
I'm sure you're very worried,

311
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,810
because I was contacted by Inspector Megure

312
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,810
telling me to handle the situation with great care.

313
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,310
Please do let us handle this case completely.

314
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,710
Yes, but...

315
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,310
Mr. Mouri,

316
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,510
I understand how you feel,

317
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,710
but I don't think that you are in a situation

318
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,710
to judge things objectively right now.

319
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,810
This case involves the life of your daughter,

320
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,110
so please bear with us for now and let us handle this.

321
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,010
All right.

322
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,610
I appreciate it.

323
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,910
Now, as to the current situation...

324
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,510
Yes, sir.

325
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,310
As a result of our inquiries within this athletic park,

326
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:14,410
the said woman victim seems to have been carried away by two men.

327
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,710
That's it.

328
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,910
About the Hirukomachi that the victim had mentioned over the phone,

329
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,610
such a town does not exist.

330
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,210
-What? -Are you serious?

331
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,110
What the heck is going on?

332
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,010
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

333
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,510
If I didn't pick up that cell phone...

334
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,710
Don't worry about it, you're not to blame.

335
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,010
The kidnappers are the villains.

336
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,910
This is no time to be playing tennis, is it?

337
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,910
Sure isn't.

338
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,210
We've got to give up the tennis match.

339
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,410
Yeah. I am worried about Ran.

340
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,010
I don't think so.

341
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,910
Like Ran was saying,

342
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,810
the whole point is to participate in the game.

343
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,810
She was for us through and through.

344
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,510
We can't give up the game now.

345
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,810
Of course I'm worried about Ran too.

346
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,710
But, there's nothing we can do by staying here either.

347
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,010
I think it's way better to show Ran our victory trophy

348
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,010
when she comes back and make her happy.

349
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,210
Yeah, but...

350
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,410
He's right.

351
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,110
Just like Mitsuhiko says,

352
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,010
we can't do anything here anyway.

353
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,510
Let's participate in the game.

354
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,910
Right, Pops?

355
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,210
Huh? Yeah, right.

356
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,510
The police is working on the case

357
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,910
and you guys made it to the finals, right?

358
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,510
If so, go for it.

359
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,310
Okay, we'll do our best.

360
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,310
We've already come this far. Then, let's give it our best shot.

361
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,110
-Okay. -Okay, then let's all do our best

362
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,710
and show Ran the champion trophy.

363
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,310
-Aye! -Aye...

364
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,110
Hey, Shinichi.

365
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,410
I'll bet you have no intention of participating in the game, do you?

366
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,910
You're planning to go search for her alone, aren't you?

367
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,910
Yeah, although I feel bad for those kids.

368
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,710
You're really something.

369
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,010
If you will excuse me...

370
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,910
Hello, this is Tamana.

371
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,110
What?

372
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,810
And?

373
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,810
Yeah.

374
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,910
Yeah.

375
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,010
Okay, do that, will you?

376
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,410
What's up? Don't tell me something happened to Ran...

377
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,210
No, the kidnappers seem to have called the station directly

378
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,510
demanding ransom, just now.

379
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,510
What?

380
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,310
An officer is on his way here

381
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,910
with the recording of the phone conversation.

382
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,710
Darn those guys, how dare they do this to Ran?

383
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,310
They're not going to get away with this!

384
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,910
What the heck's going on?

385
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,610
Why would they call the police directly for ransom?

386
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,410
Maybe this is no usual kidnapping.

387
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,210
If so, what are they actually after?

388
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,410
The last words of Ran's call was...

389
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,410
They were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

390
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,910
They're going to kill somebody today?

391
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,910
Maybe Ran?

392
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,520
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,000
"Awards ceremony"

394
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,540
Next time, we are going to save Ran.

395
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,380
Sonoko, I know who the perpetrator are.

396
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,120
Of course, because they are right beside you, aren't they?
