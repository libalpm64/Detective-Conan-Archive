1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,220
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,920
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,720
On the floor below the detective agency is Cafe Poirot.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,420
A forgotten cell phone invites a case.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,120
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,920
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,220
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:02,239
My name's Kogoro Mouri.

9
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,639
I run a detective business that fights against

10
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,939
the darkness of society called crime.

11
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,839
Conan, sonny, let's go have breakfast!

12
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,439
Conan, sonny?

13
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,839
"Cafe Poirot" -Hello!

14
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,239
Two morning sets, please.

15
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,439
Although it's a daily repetition of investigating

16
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,939
extra-marital affairs and searching for people...

17
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:26,839
There are times when I'm involved in bloody cases.

18
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:30,739
The many sad incidents that are in the papers everyday.

19
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,639
Motives vary from revenge, money matters,

20
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,239
complications in love affairs and so on forth.

21
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,539
It sure is a sick world.

22
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,739
I come here often when I get sick and tired

23
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,239
of all the bonds involved in the detective business.

24
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,739
Thank you for waiting.

25
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,239
Yes, this cup of warm coffee

26
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,639
is indeed what relieves my heart

27
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,339
that is exhausted from all bonds I have in life.

28
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,239
Hot!

29
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:03,339
What's wrong with him?

30
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:10,539
"Forgotten Cell Phone (Part 1)"

31
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,439
How unusual of you to come here from morning?

32
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,939
Are you going to be meeting a client today?

33
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,739
No, no, Ran's gone to Karate Club Camp from yesterday.

34
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,539
So, we're having a late breakfast.

35
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,939
Besides, today is Sunday.

36
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,539
I should take a break from the heap of cases

37
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,639
that come avalanching in everyday.

38
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,439
People!

39
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:38,539
Good morning!

40
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:41,639
I'm Shuhei Baisho! Shuhei Baisho here!

41
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,739
I will do whatever is in my power

42
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,439
and work for you with my entire heart and soul!

43
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,839
With your valuable ballot,

44
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,139
I Shuhei Baisho will work with you

45
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,139
to create a quiet town!

46
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,539
Work?

47
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:58,039
-Yes! Mouri Detective Agency. -Wake up, Hiroshi.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,139
Come on, it's already 8:00 in the morning.

49
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,339
You're going to get me, Yuka, in trouble

50
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,939
if you don't get up.

51
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,639
You're the one who's still groggy and not awake!

52
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,539
Check the number before you make the call!

53
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,739
Darn!

54
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,039
Excuse me, but could it be that...

55
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,839
business is slow?

56
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,539
Yes, yes.

57
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,239
We didn't get any calls all this week.

58
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,139
The thing is...

59
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,739
But...

60
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,539
I wonder if it's okay to ask a detective

61
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,639
to do something like this.

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,839
Is something troubling you, Azusa?

63
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,639
A strange thing was forgotten here

64
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,039
and I was wondering if you could locate its owner,

65
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,639
who is a customer of our shop.

66
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,439
Oh, a search for somebody.

67
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,939
What is it? That strange thing that was forgotten.

68
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,539
It's this.

69
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,439
A cell phone?

70
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,939
It looks to be an ordinary cell phone but...

71
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,539
The pattern is pretty odd.

72
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,639
Other than that, it isn't really all that strange.

73
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,039
If the person who forgot this cell phone

74
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,439
is really looking for it,

75
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,139
I'm sure that person will call.

76
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,639
Well, someone did call three times.

77
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,739
Three times?

78
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:17,339
Yup, when I answered the phone,

79
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,839
this is what the first person said...

80
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,839
"Oh? I'm sorry, I seem to have made a mistake."

81
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,239
A mistake?

82
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,239
What about the second time?

83
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,939
The second time this is what the person said.

84
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,539
"That's strange, did it ring?"

85
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,139
It seemed like someone else was beside that person.

86
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,339
Right after saying so, the phone was cut again.

87
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,439
Oh! I'm sure that the person

88
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,239
was looking for the cell phone by listening for it.

89
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,339
But, since he was looking in the wrong place,

90
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:47,539
he could have thought that

91
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,939
he had dialed the wrong number!

92
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,939
But, it didn't sound like this person

93
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:56,139
was the owner of this cell phone.

94
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,739
-Why not? -Because with the third call,

95
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:03,039
that person's tone of voice suddenly changed and...

96
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,539
"Hey, you! I'll bet you're his broad?"

97
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,139
Get him on the line!

98
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,939
He shouted saying, "I'm going to kill you!"

99
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,739
-Kill? -Kill you?

100
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,239
And?

101
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,739
What did you tell him, Azusa?

102
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,439
Well...

103
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,139
I hope you explained the circumstances to him. Did you?

104
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,639
I was scared...

105
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,239
so I switched the phone off.

106
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,939
Oh, I see.

107
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,339
Please show me the cell phone!

108
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,639
I told the master about it the following day, and was scolded.

109
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,139
So I kept the phone switched on all day since then,

110
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,939
but the phone hasn't rung so far.

111
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,139
Sure enough.

112
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,739
No wonder nobody's calling back on this cell phone.

113
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:45,939
Why do you say that?

114
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,639
Because this phone isn't working!

115
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,739
See! Even if I try to make a call,

116
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,939
I get the busy signal right away, right?

117
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,039
True.

118
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,039
I get it! The owner of this cell phone

119
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,239
probably couldn't pay his phone bill

120
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,139
and so his phone was cut off!

121
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,439
Which means the rude one who called was a money collector!

122
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,139
In other words, he called the owner of the phone

123
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,939
thinking he was living alone, but a woman answered

124
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,439
so thinking he made a mistake, he hung up.

125
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,939
He checked the number and called back.

126
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,339
But, he probably blew his top at the third call!

127
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,939
Then, why did the one who called the second time say,

128
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,339
"Did it ring?"

129
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,539
It's most likely that

130
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,039
when the collector went to the home

131
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,239
of the owner of this cell phone

132
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,139
and called him from in front of the apartment,

133
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,439
he didn't hear any sound from inside the apartment

134
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,939
so he thought it was odd.

135
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,039
Do you remember what kind of person

136
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,639
who forgot this cell phone was?

137
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,639
He came here a little after noon.

138
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,639
He was a chubby man wearing glasses

139
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,039
and his hair was parted on the side.

140
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,139
He was eating and touching that flashy cell phone all the while

141
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,039
so I remember him very well.

142
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,439
The phone rang for the first time about an hour after he left.

143
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,839
The second call came right after the first

144
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,139
and the third call came in about 30 minutes later.

145
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,539
The number of the one who called was not displayed.

146
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,439
On top of that, the record of calls made before that,

147
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,439
as well as the call received records are not saved at all.

148
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,539
Oh, there were a lot of names and numbers left on it.

149
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,239
Then, why don't you try calling those numbers?

150
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,139
Well, I sort of did.

151
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,439
They all seem to have been random numbers.

152
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,539
Besides,

153
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,339
the names all seemed to be fake too.

154
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,639
It's true and strange that all the names

155
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,939
are in Katakana characters.

156
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,839
As to the phone numbers...

157
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,739
1022?

158
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,939
I see, this is strange.

159
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:53,639
There are no 10 digit numbers that start with the number 1.

160
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,539
What's this black mark on the side of the names?

161
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,539
There are some names with black marks beside them

162
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,739
and some without!

163
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,639
True, there are marks on some and none on others.

164
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,639
Don't tell me that that all these numbers

165
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,539
are all some kind of code?

166
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,639
How annoying!

167
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,039
Darn!

168
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,839
Where was this cell phone placed when it was forgotten?

169
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,439
Well...

170
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:26,939
Over there.

171
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:31,539
Under the sofa where you're sitting right now, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,639
He probably dropped it accidentally

173
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,139
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

174
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,339
Without realizing he dropped it,

175
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,039
he kicked the cell phone with his foot.

176
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,039
That's how think it got there but...

177
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,139
Like I just explained,

178
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,339
I found the cell phone right after

179
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,839
the man called the first time.

180
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:55,039
-The antenna was sticking out besides! -What?

181
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:01,539
Was the cell phone folded in two like this back then?

182
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,839
Yup.

183
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,439
That's why I thought he dropped it

184
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,539
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

185
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,239
Don't you think it's odd?

186
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,539
Huh? Why is that so?

187
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:13,639
Because if he folded the cell phone to put into his pocket,

188
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,339
don't you think he'd naturally push the antenna back in too?

189
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,539
Right! Because you don't want the antenna to break!

190
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,239
He probably didn't do so

191
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,239
because he's either a very sloppy guy.

192
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,339
Or he did so and deliberately hid it,

193
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,639
wanting someone to find it when it rang.

194
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,939
What do you think, Pops?

195
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:39,239
Yeah, I was just about to say so.

196
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:43,039
But if so, for whatever reason...

197
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,339
You can't figure out who the owner is after all.

198
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,039
If it's the owner of this cell phone, I know who it is.

199
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,139
But how?

200
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,639
Azusa, every cell phone

201
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,339
has seal with its product number written on it.

202
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,439
If we give that number to the manufacturer,

203
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:06,239
then find out where the cell phone was bought,

204
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,139
explain the circumstances to the shop,

205
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,039
we can get the name of the owner of the cell phone!

206
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,739
Wow!

207
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,139
You take off the back cover of the cell phone.

208
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,539
And under the place where the battery is removed...

209
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,139
-Not inside. -The seal...

210
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,539
-The seal is peeled off! -Why?

211
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:29,739
Can you tell us more in detail about the customer

212
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,039
who forgot this cell phone?

213
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,139
More in detail?

214
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,839
Even the slightest detail, even if it seems trivial.

215
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,339
-Anything! -Well...

216
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,739
Come to think of it, that customer

217
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,239
ordered fried noodles, spaghetti, fruit parfait,

218
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,339
tomato juice and Caesar's salad

219
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,439
and paid exactly 3,000 yen!

220
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:56,039
3,000 yen?

221
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,739
Well, ordering the 5 items he ordered is the only way

222
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,639
to come up with a total of exactly 3,000 yen,

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,839
so I was sort of impressed!

224
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,839
Since Conan said that any trivial detail would do,

225
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,139
-I thought I'd mention it. -But...

226
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,739
the guy sure is a big eater, eating 5 items from noon.

227
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,239
Right, he seemed to be on the job and yet

228
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,639
I thought to myself he sure can eat.

229
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,939
On the job?

230
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,839
Because he asked for a receipt.

231
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,139
Receipt?

232
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,739
What the name on it?

233
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,839
Of course, "Customer".

234
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,339
I guess so.

235
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,539
Thank you so much! I'll be waiting for your ballot for me!

236
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,739
I will do my best for you all as I have been doing so far!

237
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,839
But if he was eating alone and still wanted a receipt,

238
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,839
the probability of him being an ordinary office worker

239
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,139
becomes quite unlikely.

240
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,439
If so then, what on earth...

241
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,481
He is most probably an office worker on a business trip

242
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:09,481
or a man who owns his own business.

243
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:14,181
He could be a person with that kind of habit.

244
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,481
If so, maybe he's a journalist or a detective.

245
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:20,681
Even the police ask for receipts.

246
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:24,981
Police officers in police boxes ask for receipts for meals they have?

247
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,081
Oh, no.

248
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:29,181
Hello...

249
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:33,181
That only goes for police detectives.

250
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,681
I hope you don't mind me joining you.

251
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,181
Hello.

252
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,281
When they go asking around or on a stake out,

253
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,681
or have to follow the suspect,

254
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,881
police detectives ask for receipts for transportation fee

255
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,381
and food and drinks needed during the investigation.

256
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:49,381
But, we officers in uniforms rarely use investigation fee.

257
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:52,981
Oh, you're the one who's always hanging around with Officer Takagi.

258
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,881
What brings you here, Yumi?

259
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,081
What else

260
00:13:56,081 --> 00:14:00,481
but to urge Mr. Detective here who takes forever to pay

261
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,981
for his parking ticket?

262
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:05,781
Oh, well, I was thinking of going to pay today.

263
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:07,681
Today is Sunday!

264
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,481
I'm only joking.

265
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:15,281
We're looking for a man.

266
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:18,781
But this is the only clue we have.

267
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,281
Three...

268
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,481
Three thousand yen?

269
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:23,981
Is his by chance

270
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:25,781
wearing glasses and has his hair parted on the side?

271
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,181
-A chubby man? -Yes.

272
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:31,081
Do you know where he is?

273
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,581
Well, sort of.

274
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,881
I'm glad!

275
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,381
I can finally give the cell phone back to its owner.

276
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:38,181
What do you mean give back?

277
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:42,281
That man forgot his cell phone here.

278
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,881
I also got strange calls too so I was really concerned.

279
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:50,081
But, you can't return it to him.

280
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:53,081
Because he passed away the night before last.

281
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:56,081
Passed away?

282
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,081
Oh, no.

283
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:00,681
Don't tell me he was killed?

284
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,881
No!

285
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:05,781
He was run over by a truck at the 3-chome intersection.

286
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,181
A car accident?

287
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:13,381
I remember. They aired that accident on the news.

288
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,481
Yes. The accident occurred

289
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,681
the day before yesterday just before 14:00.

290
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,781
He was taken to the hospital immediately,

291
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:21,281
but he didn't make it.

292
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:23,681
He passed away that night.

293
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:28,481
That's why we're investigating trying to identify who he is.

294
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:30,081
Wait a minute.

295
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:33,481
Don't tell me this was a hit-and-run case?

296
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,981
No.

297
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:39,781
The driver of the truck that hit the man didn't flee,

298
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:42,681
nor was he under the influence of alcohol.

299
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,281
According to testimony by the witness, the man

300
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:50,281
seems to have suddenly come running out from behind a parked car.

301
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:54,981
Which means this excludes the possibility of homicide.

302
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,981
Don't tell me? Could it have been suicide!

303
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,981
That's very unlikely,

304
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:01,481
because he seems to have asked for directions

305
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:04,581
at the convenience store near the accident site before he was hit.

306
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,381
He seems to have been in a great big rush, and asked,

307
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:10,281
"Do you know where a shop called Poirot is?"

308
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,281
If he was planning to kill himself,

309
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,181
why would he need to ask about the location

310
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,081
of a shop that is 2km away?

311
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:17,181
True.

312
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,481
But, I kind of have an idea

313
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,981
why that person rushed out into the street.

314
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,381
Yeah. In other words, the man wanted to go back to the shop

315
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,981
to retrieve the cell phone he had forgotten there,

316
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,781
and was run over by the truck.

317
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,981
No, wrong.

318
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:34,981
The dead man's lips are sealed, eh?

319
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,081
We're back to zero again.

320
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,681
The cell phone was folded in two

321
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,181
with it's antenna sticking out

322
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,581
and left here as if it were hidden here.

323
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,381
It's like the cell phone was ringing

324
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,881
just so that somebody would find it.

325
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:54,581
Those strange names and numbers that were saved in the cell phone.

326
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,881
What were they anyway?

327
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,281
What on earth was that man trying to do here?

328
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,981
But two days have already gone by since the accident.

329
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,481
It sure took you long to get here.

330
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,181
We couldn't help it

331
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,881
because he had nothing on him

332
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,081
that would give us a clue to who he was.

333
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,581
Oh, right.

334
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:16,781
But he did have all these receipts on him.

335
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,881
All of these here.

336
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:23,081
He sure meticulously kept all these receipts.

337
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:26,781
Haido. Rizen. Kenbashi.

338
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:29,181
He's gone all around the city.

339
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,481
Right.

340
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:33,181
We checked those receipts in order of the dates,

341
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,681
and it took us one whole day.

342
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:37,681
But, we finally got here.

343
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,181
There were people who remembered him too, however,

344
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:45,281
nobody knew who he was or where he came from.

345
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,381
But, things as they are, there's a possibility

346
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,781
that he was being pursued by loan sharks too.

347
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,181
Loan sharks?

348
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:55,781
That's right. There seems to have been a call

349
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,481
on the cell phone that he forgot.

350
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:00,581
"If you don't put him on, I'll kill you!",

351
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,281
a dangerous sounding man shouted so.

352
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:04,881
Really?

353
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:09,581
Yes, three times, about an hour after the man left.

354
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:13,281
At any rate, I'd advise you to go check the loan sharks.

355
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,881
If he did borrow money,

356
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:21,281
he would've left his address and name with them too.

357
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:22,681
Huh? What?

358
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:26,481
I think you can easily find out without doing something like that.

359
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,581
Because the dangerous man who called

360
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:32,481
knows the number of the cell phone, right?

361
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:36,081
If I were him and the phone didn't work,

362
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,581
I would give the number to the telephone company

363
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,881
and have them check on who the man is!

364
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:42,181
And?

365
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:47,081
So! If you call the phone company, you'll be able to find out

366
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:49,681
if the dangerous man called.

367
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,981
You fool!

368
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:54,081
Unless you're the police or something, the telephone company

369
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:59,281
would never give out the name and address of anyone!

370
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:02,281
Understand, Conan, sonny?

371
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,881
Oh, but there are times when we panic and rush to make a call,

372
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:09,081
don't you think?

373
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:13,381
There was a time when I got lost going to my friend's house,

374
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:17,081
and when I tried calling her, her cell phone was switched off.

375
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:20,681
So, I called the telephone company and asked for her address.

376
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:23,081
I asked them if they could find my friend's address

377
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:26,381
-from her cell phone number. -Right, right!

378
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:29,581
Does everybody often do things like that?

379
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:31,981
And? Did they find her address for you?

380
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,281
No, they didn't.

381
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:35,481
So, I had the police officer at the police box

382
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:37,681
look up her address for me.

383
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:40,781
Well, it's true though, that if the man

384
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,781
was in a rush to look for the owner of the phone,

385
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,081
he would've tried calling the phone company,

386
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,981
despite knowing that it might not work.

387
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:49,881
Ms. Numata, please look up the number of the phone companies.

388
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,281
-Okay! -Let's try each and every one and ask them

389
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:56,381
whether they got a call or not.

390
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:59,381
It's nice that the police get to ask anything they want.

391
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:05,481
I guess so! Although it may take a while to get through the red tape.

392
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,381
So long as we have the phone number,

393
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:11,581
it's as if we've already got his address and name!

394
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,881
Yes.

395
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:16,181
As long as we kept that e-mail address,

396
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,881
we could've gotten to them

397
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:21,381
if we had what the lady had entered on her cell phone.

398
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,981
We would've been able to find the hide-out of the boss

399
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,881
who controls them all.

400
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,481
Yes, from about day before yesterday.

401
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,681
Yes, that's right.

402
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:32,381
Yes.

403
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:35,381
I understand, thank you so much.

404
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,381
-How'd it go? -I don't know yet.

405
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,281
I've got to wait for them to call me back.

406
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,381
I'll try elsewhere too.

407
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:45,481
Azusa, please serve the customer on table no.1

408
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,381
another cup of coffee.

409
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:48,881
Oh, yes, sir.

410
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,681
Thank you.

411
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,181
No problem. Hang in there and keep up your studies.

412
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,081
Oh, I will.

413
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:01,881
Yes, the address, name and phone number.

414
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,881
Did you get any calls asking for personal information on a man?

415
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,181
Would you like another serving?

416
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,481
-Oh, thank you. -Yes.

417
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:12,481
Yes, from 2 days ago.

418
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,981
Yes, yes.

419
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,781
This is on the house.

420
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:16,881
Thank you!

421
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:24,081
-I leave it here. -Oh! Thank you, so very much.

422
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:28,081
Here you go! Orange juice for you, Conan!

423
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:30,981
Thank you, Azusa!

424
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:33,581
I'm sorry to have got you involved in something like this

425
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:35,981
on a precious Sunday, your day of rest.

426
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:40,281
Will you show me that cell phone that was forgotten one more time?

427
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,581
Sure.

428
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:44,781
-Here you go. -Thank you.

429
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,181
This is funny!

430
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:54,781
The clue that's left on the cell phone.

431
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:58,081
A mysterious 10 digit number that begins with the number "1".

432
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:03,181
And the unexplainable black marks that are beside the names.

433
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:05,681
What on earth do they mean?

434
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:08,781
Thank you for your support! Shuhei Baisho!

435
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:12,881
Will do my best for this town with all my might!

436
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,781
Thank you!

437
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:25,381
Yes. Hello.

438
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:29,281
Yes, that's right. Yes! Yes!

439
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,781
Did she get something?

440
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,981
A clue on the man.

441
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,008
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:36,008
"Big shot"

443
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:36,908
The next episode is part 2.

444
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,108
Don't forget your cell phones, everybody.

445
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:39,008
Take care and don't catch cold.

446
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:41,054
Brush your teeth, okay?
