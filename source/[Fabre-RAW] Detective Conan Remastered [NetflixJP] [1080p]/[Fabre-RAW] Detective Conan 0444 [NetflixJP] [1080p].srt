1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,261
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,161
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:07,761
A fantastic deduction that astonishes

4
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:09,061
monster police officer, younger brother of Yokomizo.

5
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:10,561
The Youth Detective Squad is all out to get!

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,861
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:13,561
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,861
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,298 --> 00:02:01,498
We came clam digging along with Dr. Agasa.

10
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:04,898
We coincidentally run into university students of the Clam Devotees Club

11
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:07,498
who have come to dig clams and get acquainted.

12
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:13,098
However, one of them, Mr. Tsuguo Ushigome

13
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:16,098
dies of cyanide poisoning!

14
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,198
From the circumstances at the scene,

15
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:21,198
the possibility of suicide is most likely, however...

16
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:25,298
But, isn't that strange?

17
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:28,298
There's blood on the rim of the bottle where you drink from

18
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,498
but there's nothing on the cap.

19
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:33,898
Ushigome hurt his finger.

20
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:35,198
Hurt?

21
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,698
If so, maybe he cut his finger with a cracked shell or something

22
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,998
when he was digging clams.

23
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:43,598
I think he was digging clams with thinking of something, so...

24
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,498
I see.

25
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:50,498
It's true that he has a cut on the index finger of his right hand.

26
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:53,498
Although the blood looks dry.

27
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:56,298
In other words, when he first opened the cap,

28
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:59,998
his wound wasn't closed up yet and the cap was stained with blood.

29
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:03,398
But, when he brought the bottle here and opened it again,

30
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,398
he noticed the blood on it

31
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:09,198
so he wiped off the blood first and then opened it again.

32
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:22,998
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 2)"

33
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:35,498
Genta, please don't eat candy here!

34
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,698
Want a bite?

35
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,298
He opened them all!

36
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,698
I mean how long are you going to make us wait,

37
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:43,198
younger brother of Yokomizo?

38
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,498
Yes, Yokomizo.

39
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:51,598
Oh, hello, and how did the results come out?

40
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,698
I guess they got the results.

41
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:57,698
-Let's go see! -Okay!

42
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:00,898
Hey, wait!

43
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,398
Let's see...

44
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,998
Which one...

45
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:08,498
What should I do?

46
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,498
According to the report by the forensic officer,

47
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:17,898
the poison that was inside the green tea was cyanide.

48
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:21,498
Poison was also detected on the cap of the bottle.

49
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,498
Taking into consideration that the contents of the glass bottle

50
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:26,698
that was found in the car was also cyanide...

51
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:30,398
it's probably safe to conclude that Mr. Ushigome committed suicide.

52
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,598
Is that so?

53
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,798
By the way, whose car is this?

54
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:37,098
A rental car that Ushigome rented.

55
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:41,498
He always drives when we come clam digging.

56
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,098
Which means you come to this beach frequently?

57
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,398
No, this is our first time here.

58
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:49,698
We were actually planning to come here last week but...

59
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,198
But?

60
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:53,198
It became inconvenient for us

61
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:54,698
so we postponed it to this week!

62
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,798
Well, we'll get to the details at the station.

63
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:02,898
Was blood found on the cap of the bottle?

64
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,998
Yes, although just slightly, there seems to have blood on it,

65
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:08,498
together with Mr. Ushigome's fingerprints.

66
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:10,098
Just slightly?

67
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,898
When he first opened the bottle,

68
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:16,998
his wound probably didn't touch his wound much.

69
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:21,998
So! Now that you know, go on home, kids!

70
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:23,798
Suicide.

71
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:25,798
Is it really suicide?

72
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:29,498
It's true that since Mr. Ushigome opened the cap of the bottle of green tea

73
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:34,698
and started drinking it, nobody touched it.

74
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:39,698
Mr. Ushigome himself brought the PET bottle here.

75
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:43,898
So, there was no chance for anyone to put poison in his drink.

76
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:47,498
But, something bothers me. That person's remark.

77
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,398
Why did that person say that back then?

78
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:52,698
What's with you? You look funny.

79
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:56,898
It can't be helped! Both my hands were tied!

80
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,498
Then, why don't you wrapped the chocolate in the foil

81
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:02,398
and put the snacks together into the bag?

82
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:06,998
I hate to let go of food that I got a hold of once!

83
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,198
You all had a trash bag, didn't you?

84
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:18,298
Yeah.

85
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,898
Yes.

86
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:22,298
You gotta go to the police from here, right?

87
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,398
Would you like me to throw the trash away for you?

88
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,698
Okay.

89
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:28,698
But there are food and drinks that we ate and drank in the car too,

90
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,798
so there's quite a lot of trash.

91
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,798
These are for recycling PET bottles.

92
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,598
This is for combustible trash.

93
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,498
And, this is for non-combustible trash.

94
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,198
Thanks, then!

95
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:43,798
-Yep! -Oh, Conan!

96
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,598
What's all that?

97
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:52,298
Just what's on your mind, bringing all this trash along with you?

98
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,098
Hey!

99
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:05,398
They were all separated nicely and yet...

100
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,998
Are you going to make something?

101
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:10,198
What are you going to make with the PET bottle?

102
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:18,098
I see. So, that's the story.

103
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,598
My, that grinning triumphant look of yours,

104
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,698
means that you've figured something out, doesn't it?

105
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,898
Yeah. It wasn't suicide!

106
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,098
Really?

107
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:28,798
Then, who's the culprit?

108
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,298
Before I tell you,

109
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:33,798
I'd like you guys to help me out with something.

110
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,098
What is it?

111
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,498
A bit of clam digging!

112
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:42,198
Conan, if you already figured out who the culprit is,

113
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:45,098
why do we have to dig clams?

114
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,698
Besides, since we're so far away from the edge of the water,

115
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:51,598
I don't think there are any clams here.

116
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,998
This is the place where the students had their mats out.

117
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:00,898
Yes. The trash has all been cleared away, much less the clams,

118
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,898
and there's nothing left.

119
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:06,698
So, what we're looking for are not clams but PET bottle...

120
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,798
I found one! I found the cap of a PET bottle!

121
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,598
Don't touch it, Ayumi!

122
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:17,798
Okay!

123
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,498
Green tea is written on it, isn't it?

124
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:22,598
If I remember correctly, the drink that the man named Ushigome

125
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:25,098
was drinking was green tea, right?

126
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:28,398
What's more, isn't that blood on the cap?

127
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,298
See.

128
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:34,498
Although it's blackish, that's probably blood.

129
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:36,898
Then, don't tell me that the cap is...

130
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:40,498
Yeah. This will clear everything.

131
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:47,198
That Mr. Ushigome didn't commit suicide, but was killed.

132
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:50,898
As well as by who!

133
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,098
Okay, we'll question them at the station

134
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:55,098
so take the three by police car and...

135
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:56,798
Hey!

136
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:59,298
Younger brother!

137
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,298
Please wait!

138
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:03,898
Wait.

139
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:07,898
Will you hear me out before you take those three with you?

140
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,198
Hear you out?

141
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:10,798
We've figured it out.

142
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:13,098
Figured what out?

143
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:17,298
The one who killed Mr. Ushigome!

144
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:23,198
And, that killer is among the three people

145
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,698
who came clam digging with Mr. Ushigome too!

146
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,198
What?

147
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,203
Hey, hey, just what are you getting at?

148
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:43,103
This is suicide, suicide!

149
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:48,103
Mr. Ushigome came back alone to this car that was parked here.

150
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:52,403
And, when the three here returned from the beach after cleaning up,

151
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,303
he was dead, you know.

152
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,203
Moreover, the green tea bottle with the cyanide that poisoned him

153
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:59,303
was found on the ground beside him,

154
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:03,103
and at his feet, the glass bottle that had cyanide inside it was found.

155
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,503
Taking into consideration that

156
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:09,103
Mr. Ushigome was drinking the tea without problem,

157
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,803
the only thing thinkable is that

158
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:15,603
he came back here poured the poison into his drink and drank it, right?

159
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:18,303
But, Mr. Ushigome is not the one

160
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:20,703
who went to buy the bottle of green tea, right?

161
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,703
No.

162
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,903
These went to buy it.

163
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:30,603
Ms. Yashima handed the bottle of green tea to him.

164
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:34,003
Mr. Mitsuse threw the rice balls to him.

165
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:36,403
And Ms. Hisatsu just opened the package of snacks

166
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,703
and put it beside him...

167
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:41,803
After Mr. Ushigome opened the cap of his bottle of green tea,

168
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:45,003
none of the three touched it.

169
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,603
And even after that

170
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:50,503
Mr. Ushigome held the bottle himself right through, isn't that right?

171
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:54,403
Just when and how could somebody have inserted the poison?

172
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,903
Haven't you forgotten something?

173
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:57,903
Forgotten something?

174
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:02,903
Well, "something" always comes with the PET bottle, doesn't it?

175
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:06,203
Things that come with PET bottles are...

176
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:11,903
The labels with the product names on them.

177
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,803
Just what are you talking about, younger brother?

178
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,903
The cap, the cap of the bottle!

179
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:22,503
If poison is smeared onto the inside of the cap...

180
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,703
All you have to do is switch the cap to one with poison on it,

181
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:28,003
and you don't even have to touch the bottle...

182
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,203
To simply mix the poison into the drink!

183
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,603
I see, great deduction...

184
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:35,003
is what I'd like to say.

185
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:37,203
But, that's not possible, brats.

186
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:42,503
If the bottle was filled to the top with green tea, then, maybe...

187
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:47,503
But, Mr. Ushigome seems to have removed the cap and gulped tea down!

188
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:51,803
If so, even if the cap were changed to one with poison on it,

189
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:55,703
the poison on the closed cap wouldn't have reached the green tea at all.

190
00:11:55,703 --> 00:12:00,403
However, suppose that you apply it on the spiral part inside the cap?

191
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:04,503
I see! Then the poison will go on to the mouth of the bottle

192
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:06,403
when he puts the cap back on.

193
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:08,803
Yeah, if so then it's most likely that when he drinks tea,

194
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:10,803
his mouth would touch that part,

195
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,603
but the cyanide in question,

196
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:17,303
fatal enough to kill was detected inside the PET bottle of green tea.

197
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,403
If only the mouth of the bottle had poison on it,

198
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:24,103
then there wouldn't be much poison found in the drink itself!

199
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,303
True.

200
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:29,903
Well, in order to mix the poison that is on the cap into the drink,

201
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:32,403
you'd have to turn the bottle upside down

202
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:35,203
and shake it vigorously to mix the poison with the tea.

203
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:38,303
Did Mr. Ushigome have a habit of doing something like that?

204
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,703
-No. -He did shake the container

205
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,203
if it was tomato juice or something.

206
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,003
Maybe he placed it sideways?

207
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:45,603
Sideways?

208
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:47,403
If I remember correctly, Mr. Ushigome

209
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:50,603
returned to the car holding two buckets, right?

210
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,303
Yeah, that's right.

211
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,103
-Hey. -Why did Mr. Ushigome

212
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,603
have to take the buckets to the car

213
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,003
all by himself without anybody helping him?

214
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:03,003
Ushigome was most knowledgeable about clams.

215
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,503
He was always in charge of digging clams

216
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,203
and making them spit out sand.

217
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,003
We were the ones who did the cooking, though.

218
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,203
-Hey. -Did you always have just two buckets?

219
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:17,203
Yes, just about always.

220
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,703
Who cares about the number of buckets?

221
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:22,403
Figure out why the bottle was placed sideways!

222
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:25,703
Well, Mr. Ushigome was holding two buckets

223
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,603
and both his hands were full.

224
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:29,603
So?

225
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:32,403
If so, he'd either put the bottle in the bucket

226
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:33,903
or hold it under his arm,

227
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:37,503
or have no other choice than to put the bottle sideways...

228
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:42,103
into the pocket of the parkas that you're all wearing, right?

229
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:43,303
Now that you mentioned it,

230
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:48,503
Mr. Ushigome had the bottle placed sideways as you just said.

231
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,103
I see. If he places it sideways,

232
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:54,703
then when he walks the green tea inside would be shaken

233
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,703
and by the time he gets to the parking lot,

234
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,403
the poison that is smeared onto the inside of the cap of the bottle

235
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:02,203
would be sufficiently mixed!

236
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:04,203
Yeah, that's exactly right.

237
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,403
But this worked out

238
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:10,903
because he just happened to be wearing a parka with a pocket.

239
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:14,203
I don't think it was a coincident!

240
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,403
The parkas that they are wearing

241
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:20,203
are parkas that were made exclusively for the Clam Devotees Club.

242
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,103
Moreover, it seems to have been made just recently.

243
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:25,403
So, if everyone decides to wear it when coming to dig for clams today,

244
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,803
I'm sure Mr. Ushigome would have worn it too, don't you?

245
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:31,403
And if Mr. Ushigome always carried two buckets

246
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,103
and returned to the car alone...

247
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:36,503
It is more or less predictable that

248
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:40,503
he would put the bottle sideways in the pocket of his parka.

249
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:44,403
It's true that the poison would most likely be mixed if so, but...

250
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:45,403
The question is,

251
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:48,903
who switched the cap to the one with poison on it, and how.

252
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,803
When you remove the cap,

253
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,403
you usually place it near yourself, don't you?

254
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,303
True.

255
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:59,403
I think that Mr. Ushigome also put it

256
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,203
somewhere on the mat he was sitting on.

257
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,203
Which means that

258
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:10,003
Ms. Yashima only handed the bottle over to him by hand.

259
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,603
She couldn't have switched the cap.

260
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:17,403
That means that Mr. Mitsuse couldn't have done it either

261
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:20,903
because all he did was throw the rice balls to him.

262
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:24,803
If he were to stretch over and try to switch the cap of the bottle,

263
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:26,803
it would be obvious...

264
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:30,703
Which means the only one remaining would be the one

265
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:32,403
who placed the bag of potato chips near Mr. Ushigome.

266
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:35,403
Ms. Hisatsu, it seems that you could've switched the caps

267
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,803
that were on the mat that you were sitting on.

268
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,903
Oh, no.

269
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:43,403
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

270
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,903
How could she if all she did was to put down a bag of chips?

271
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,803
The bag of potato chips would've served as a great blinder.

272
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:58,503
Ms. Hisatsu put the bag of potato chips right beside Mr. Ushigome.

273
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:01,603
She had the poisoned cap pinched between her fingers beforehand.

274
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,403
She hides it with the bag of potato chips and switches the cap.

275
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:06,203
Then, Mr. Ushigome would think that the cap beside him

276
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,003
is the one he put there.

277
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:12,803
There was blood on the mouth of the PET bottle but none on the cap

278
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,503
because he touched the poisoned cap only after it had been switched

279
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:17,703
and the cut of his finger had dried up.

280
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:21,303
Well, even if his cut were to be dried,

281
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:23,903
blood was also detected from the poisoned cap

282
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:27,903
because his finger touched the cap each time he opened and closed the cap.

283
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,503
That's what you're getting at, right, kid?

284
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:31,603
Yep!

285
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:33,403
Right, Doc?

286
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:35,503
Yeah.

287
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:40,703
Which means the cap with Ushigome's blood on it should be somewhere.

288
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,103
If I remember correctly, you all had trash bags, didn't you?

289
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,603
Oh, well... we handed the bags over to the kid wearing glasses.

290
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,303
Hey, hey, don't tell me you checked the cap?

291
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:56,503
Yep! Although there were six PET bottles, there were only five caps!

292
00:16:56,503 --> 00:17:00,203
Only the cap for the empty green tea bottle was gone!

293
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:02,603
So, in other words,

294
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,503
the culprit had a bottle of green tea beforehand,

295
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:07,703
and made Mr. Ushigome drink all the tea in it,

296
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:10,103
after which she kept the cap.

297
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,203
She inserted poison in the bottle somewhere,

298
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:15,903
and switched the cap of that bottle to the one with poison on it.

299
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:17,603
After a while, taking time into consideration,

300
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,503
if she urges everyone to head home,

301
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:24,203
Mr. Ushigome who returns to the car drinks the poisoned green tea.

302
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:27,403
If the glass bottle that was left on the floor of the car beforehand

303
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,303
is found later by the police,

304
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,903
it would look as if he committed suicide!

305
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,503
That glass bottle was most likely one that the killer

306
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:40,103
got hold of from Mr. Ushigome and used, to set the scene for suicide.

307
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:44,403
But when the cap was switched, her calculations went wrong.

308
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:50,903
Mr. Ushigome's blood was on the cap.

309
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,203
That's why you didn't put it in the trash bag, right?

310
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,503
Because if the cap is found,

311
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:59,403
the fact that you switched the caps would be disclosed.

312
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:02,903
Well, you probably disposed of the cap somewhere.

313
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,803
But, if we check the beach around the area where you were...

314
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,203
We thought so too and searched for it.

315
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,803
See!

316
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:12,003
The blood stained cap of the green tea bottle!

317
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,603
Kid!

318
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:27,803
But is that going to serve as proof?

319
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,503
Her fingerprints would already be on the cap

320
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,103
when she bought it at the convenience store!

321
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:34,303
No... not the fingerprints.

322
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:38,303
If she touched the cap,

323
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:41,003
it should be detected from Ms. Hisatsu's finger too.

324
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:44,303
The luminol reaction, that is also the evidence

325
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,803
that she touched Mr. Ushigome's blood.

326
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:47,903
Hey, Shoko!

327
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:50,203
Are you going to stand for him talking about you like that?

328
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,903
Tell him he's wrong!

329
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,203
Tell him to go ahead and investigate if he wants to!

330
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,603
He's not wrong.

331
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:02,103
What the officer is saying is all true.

332
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:04,703
-Huh? -Hey, don't tell me that it's about that accident...

333
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:05,903
Accident?

334
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,403
Hey, what accident are you talking about?

335
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:11,803
Remember, the other day?

336
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:14,503
There was a hit-and-run accident near here.

337
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:16,703
Maybe it has something to do with that?

338
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:20,403
They all looked tense when that accident was mentioned.

339
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:22,103
A hit-and-run accident?

340
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,703
You mean the accident where a drunkard was run over...

341
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:27,503
Don't tell me that you guys are involved?

342
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:30,703
We didn't know about it until we read the papers the following day!

343
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,503
-Besides... -Hey!

344
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,603
Besides, what?

345
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:40,403
Besides, Ushigome said it felt like he hit somebody

346
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,803
so we stopped the car right away and all went to check,

347
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:44,203
but there was no one there.

348
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,203
-There was. -Huh?

349
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:49,303
There was someone there, back then.

350
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,803
In the grassy area that I checked.

351
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:56,703
There was a blood smeared man lying on the ground.

352
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,903
Why didn't you tell us about it?

353
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,103
I couldn't say anything!

354
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:04,703
Because the man was already dead and Ushigome was drinking too.

355
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,803
If this came out to the light, the job that I finally got

356
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,503
would go down the drain too.

357
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:12,303
Right, as long as Ushigome kept his mouth shut.

358
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:15,403
If he only didn't say, "I'm going to turn myself in."

359
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:19,303
Just like clams.

360
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,603
No matter how well you think something is hidden,

361
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:25,203
the traces of it is somewhere for sure.

362
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,503
The more you try to hide something, the more obvious it becomes,

363
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:30,003
quite difficult to handle.

364
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,703
Even if Mr. Ushigome didn't confess,

365
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,403
we the police would've got to him eventually.

366
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:39,303
We would've found that rotten hole in your heart either way!

367
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:22,103
We've finally finished cleaning up.

368
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:25,303
We couldn't leave just like that so...

369
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,103
But, to think that you figured out who the killer was

370
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:31,403
just by seeing her put the bag of potato chips near the victim.

371
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:34,003
That's not all!

372
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:37,403
When blood was found on the mouth of the PET bottle,

373
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:42,603
she mentioned Mr. Ushigome hurting his finger.

374
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:44,903
How does that connect?

375
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:48,403
I knew that Mr. Ushigome had an injured finger.

376
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:51,503
But if blood is found on the mouth of the bottle,

377
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,803
most people would think that

378
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:57,003
the person cut his lips or inside his mouth, right?

379
00:22:57,003 --> 00:23:01,703
No blood was found on the cap that was on the floor near Mr. Ushigome.

380
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,803
That's how I figured it out!

381
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,503
I thought that Ms. Hisatsu said that

382
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:10,403
because she saw the blood smeared cap when she switched caps.

383
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:15,903
Isn't it just like you said, Doc?

384
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:16,903
Huh?

385
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:19,403
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:20,903
Oh, right,

387
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:23,603
I'll have you come to the station later too,

388
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:26,003
so bring the brats and...

389
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,303
Where are the others?

390
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,403
Huh? True.

391
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:35,103
They all went rushing back to the beach a while ago,

392
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,603
saying they lost something important.

393
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:44,003
It was a Yaiba doll that I've never seen before.

394
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:47,403
Don't you remember where you dropped it?

395
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:50,303
If I remember, I'd find it right away!

396
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,803
It was a super rare doll.

397
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:56,003
We gotta buy whole lot to get a hold of it again, you know.

398
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,503
You guys really like clam digging, don't you?

399
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,720
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
"Girlish writing"

401
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,500
There are no girlish girls on Detective Conan's cast.
