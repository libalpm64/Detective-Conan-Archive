1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,680
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,680
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,580
Today is show time for the troupe.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,780
The scenario and murder case are solved at once.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,380
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,580
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,290
We went to watch play practice of a strolling players troupe,

9
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,090
because the leader of the troupe, Tamanosuke Ito

10
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,790
entered Ran's class as a new student.

11
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,490
We encountered what looked to be a complicated problem backstage.

12
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,990
And a murder was finally committed.

13
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,190
At the time the murder was committed,

14
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,390
everyone was on stage practicing.

15
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,090
However, there is someone here,

16
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,590
who without us in the audience noticing,

17
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,490
committed the murder.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,490
"The Strolling Players Troupe (Part 2)"

19
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,090
We are in front of the inn

20
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,890
where the strolling players troupe is staying,

21
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,290
Mr. Tetsuo Chikaishi who was murdered last night

22
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,390
was a member of this group.

23
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,190
The young troupe leader is presently being interrogated by the police...

24
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,290
Gosh.

25
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,790
Megumi, your brother's back!

26
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,890
Tamanosuke!

27
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,790
Are you all right?

28
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,990
Yes, I'm all right.

29
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,890
You haven't had any sleep since last night. How can you be okay?

30
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,690
Tamanosuke.

31
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,890
Well, why don't you get some rest?

32
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,990
Make yourself at home.

33
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,890
I'm sorry to trouble you.

34
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,290
We've been taking care of you ever since the days of your father.

35
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,090
"Beika Inn"

36
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,290
Tamanosuke?

37
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,590
Why did he come here at this time of night?

38
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,090
I wonder why he came to the theater.

39
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,990
Conan.

40
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,190
Gosh, you scared me.

41
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,890
You're worried about your brother, aren't you?

42
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,390
Yes, sort of.

43
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,390
What bring you here, Conan?

44
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,990
I was a bit concerned about your brother, too.

45
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,190
At any rate, you can leave the rest to me,

46
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,290
and you'd better go back to the inn.

47
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,390
Conan, are you trying to chase me away?

48
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,790
No!

49
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,490
I mean this is no time for a child to be outside.

50
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,190
You're the same age as me, Conan!

51
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,590
I wonder where Tamanosuke is.

52
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,990
What was that?

53
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,290
It's towards the stage!

54
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,990
Tamanosuke.

55
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,190
Get a hold of yourself, Tamanosuke!

56
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,890
Gosh. The suspect still hasn't gone far.

57
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,290
Megumi, get an ambulance! -Okay.

58
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,190
Conan!

59
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,590
I'm all right.

60
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,790
Itoe!

61
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,790
Tamanosuke Ito had been hit hard on the head

62
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,790
and is unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital.

63
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,590
The one who was dead at the bottom of the pit was

64
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,790
Itoe Ogiwara, the accountant, as well as an actress in the troupe.

65
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,790
The cause of her death was her fall into the pit.

66
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,590
What's this?

67
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,090
I will reveal your true identity.

68
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,190
Wait on stage at 24:00.

69
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,890
True identity?

70
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,390
Inspector, she is holding something in her hand.

71
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,290
It's a note.

72
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,790
Inspector, the same thing is on the floor over here too.

73
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,890
What is the meaning of this?

74
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,090
Hey, Conan!

75
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,190
Why are you here?

76
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,990
Thanks for coming, Mr. Mouri.

77
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,490
Conan is the one who found the corpse.

78
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,290
What?

79
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,790
There are a lot of small pieces of wood around the corpse.

80
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,290
What's this?

81
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,490
Hurry back home and go to bed, kid!

82
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,290
What time do you think it is?

83
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,590
"The next day" -What do you mean?

84
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,190
How dare you treat Tamanosuke who has gotten hurt, as a suspect!

85
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,490
It can't be helped

86
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,490
because his fingerprints were on the crowbar

87
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,290
which was the murder weapon.

88
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,890
How about the fingerprints of anybody else?

89
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,790
Although the prints of few other members of the troupe were on it,

90
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,790
Itoe's fingerprints weren't there.

91
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,590
Which means that it can't be that Itoe fell into the pit

92
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,090
after she attacked Tamanosuke and died.

93
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,090
But Tamanosuke could never kill anyone!

94
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,490
Ran, let's go visit him at the hospital.

95
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,490
Okay.

96
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,690
Dad, look after Conan and the others, okay?

97
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,890
Tamanosuke can't have any visitors

98
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,690
because he's a suspect.

99
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,890
But Megumi should be with him.

100
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,690
All we're going to do is deliver flowers to him.

101
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,990
Let's hurry and go.

102
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,690
He still unconscious.

103
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,290
It's just the thought that counts, so who cares!

104
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,990
Gosh.

105
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,190
Pops. If Tamanosuke is the suspect,

106
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,590
does it mean that he hit himself so hard that he knocked himself unconscious?

107
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,490
No.

108
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,790
According to the doctor, his wound is not serious,

109
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,890
but he's probably unconscious because of mental trauma.

110
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,790
I see. If it's caused by mental trauma of him

111
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,190
wanting to run from the reality of having committed a crime,

112
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,290
he would still be considered the prime suspect.

113
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,290
Even the note was analyzed for its handwriting

114
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,590
and was found to be written by Tamanosuke.

115
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,790
What?

116
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,490
Besides, the same note was sent out to all the members of the troupe.

117
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,290
Why, if his intention was to call Itoe out?

118
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,190
How should I know?

119
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,590
However, she had a lot of money saved up,

120
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,590
and it seems she embezzled a great sum of money from the troupe.

121
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,490
In other words, the leader of the troupe

122
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,190
punished the playwrighter, Chikaishi, who wouldn't obey him,

123
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,090
and Itoe who cheated the account.

124
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,890
I wonder if he'd kill for something like that.

125
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,190
Wait, Conan! Bring me some beer.

126
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,990
It's still broad daylight, you know.

127
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,090
Let's not be so square.

128
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,590
I'll tell you more about the case.

129
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,590
Gosh.

130
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,790
Here's something to munch on!

131
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,290
Thank you.

132
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,690
And, was Mr. Chikaishi's floppy found?

133
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,590
It came out of Tamanosuke's room.

134
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,090
The contents were all erased,

135
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,090
and it was thrown in the wastebasket.

136
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,690
Huh? The contents were erased?

137
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,890
Maybe there was something inside that he didn't want anyone to see.

138
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,190
But it would be found right away if it were thrown in a place like that.

139
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,890
What should I care?

140
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,390
Forget it, and go play outside already.

141
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,290
He's always like this when he can't cope with the situation.

142
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,690
Talk about useless.

143
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,590
-Let's go. -Okay.

144
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,490
Wait a minute. Get me another can!

145
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,290
Conan. There are no pieces of chipped wood like there were down there.

146
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,690
That's right! Maybe we can find wood.

147
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,990
I get it!

148
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,190
She may have been killed in a different place and then pushed into the pit.

149
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,990
It's this color.

150
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,290
They were pieces of plywood.

151
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,990
-You mean this? -No! Idiot!

152
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,890
Huh? What's with this?

153
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,490
There's blood on it!

154
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,790
It is about the same size as the pit.

155
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,890
The color also resembles that of the stage.

156
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,290
-It's trap! -Yeah.

157
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,390
There are even slash marks on the palywood that is 3 millimeters thick

158
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,190
so that it would break easily.

159
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,290
After she fell and died,

160
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,790
she was carried over there and hidden, wasn't she?

161
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,490
Did Tamanosuke hit himself after that?

162
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,490
No. You and I followed him from the inn,

163
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,990
so he had no time to set up such a trap.

164
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,190
Oh, no!

165
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,290
-We've got to hurry! -Hey! What is it?

166
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,690
Tamanosuke is in danger!

167
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,290
What?

168
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,390
The killer is another person!

169
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,380
Okay, I got it, Mr. Mouri.

170
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,880
I'll get everything ready.

171
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,080
Okay, I'll leave everything in your hands from here.

172
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,680
Inspector.

173
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,580
Yes, this is Conan.

174
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,580
This is Ayumi.

175
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,680
We've succeeded getting into the inn.

176
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,480
All the people of the troupe are here.

177
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,280
Mr. Tajima who is closest to the stairs

178
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,180
is in his room watching TV.

179
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,280
Yuri Shirai is straighten out her costumes.

180
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,480
Mr. Muraki who has moved to the room of Mr. Chikaishi, who died,

181
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,280
seems to be cleaning his room.

182
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,480
That's it. Over.

183
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,780
All right. You can all go home now.

184
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,180
Hey, Conan! -Wait, Conan!

185
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,080
He's done it again.

186
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,680
"Haido City Hospital"

187
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,980
That's it!

188
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,780
Shoots!

189
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Don't let him get away!

190
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,180
What?

191
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,880
You're not getting away!

192
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,480
Shoots!

193
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,780
He is as nimble as the Edo Kid.

194
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,280
The Edo Kid was among the members of the troupe.

195
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,180
Tamanosuke who realized his existence,

196
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,580
tried to disclose his identity by creating a play about him.

197
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,380
However, Mr. Chikaishi found out who it was before he did.

198
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,480
Mr. Chikaishi probably blackmailed that person for this.

199
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,180
That's why the man killed Mr. Chikaishi,

200
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,480
took the floppy and fled.

201
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
Tamanosuke who had confirmed the existence of the Edo Kid,

202
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,180
was vexed that a murder had actually occurred.

203
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,580
That's why he sent out the note.

204
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,780
"Beika Inn"

205
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,380
Yes.

206
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,980
Inspector.

207
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,380
I'm sorry to call on you so late, Mr. Tajima.

208
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,980
Have you gone out anywhere tonight?

209
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,280
No. -He was home.

210
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,480
None of the members of the troupe went outside.

211
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Hey, you guys!

212
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,680
Which means that Conan is here, too.

213
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,180
Nope, I just got here.

214
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,280
Conan!

215
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
So, they're here after all.

216
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,180
They're even testifying alibi.

217
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,680
I'm sure that he is the Edo Kid.

218
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,480
But I don't have proof.

219
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,880
Neat!

220
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,280
This is quite exciting, isn't it?

221
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,980
Why should only Conan be left behind? It's not fair!

222
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,680
It can't be helped.

223
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,980
His guardian is with him, after all.

224
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,980
Right.

225
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,080
And besides, who cares because we get to ride in a police car.

226
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,280
Off we go. -I don't want to go home!

227
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,780
Well, this sure is relaxing.

228
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,180
A glass of beer is refreshing after a hard day's work,

229
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,580
so have some.

230
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,780
No, thank you, because I'm still on the job.

231
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,380
Well, one glass can't do any harm.

232
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,980
Right.

233
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,280
Talk about taking it easy.

234
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,780
When there is hardly no time left.

235
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,380
No time left?

236
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,780
I get it!

237
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,680
Only two people had time

238
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,980
when Mr. Chikaishi was murdered.

239
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,380
But the person that matches the physique of the one

240
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,880
who attacked Tamanosuke is him.

241
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,380
Boy, it really stings.

242
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,080
Please gather here everyone.

243
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,380
What is it?

244
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,780
I've figured out who the killer is.

245
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,580
So, it's come?

246
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,280
The person who killed Mr. Chikaishi and Itoe Ogiwara,

247
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,780
as well as attack Tamanosuke twice

248
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,980
is among us here.

249
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,580
-What? -What did you say?

250
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,780
That's nothing but baloney!

251
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,080
Well, come now, let's at least lend him an ear.

252
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,980
After all, thanks to Mr. Mouri,

253
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,580
Tamanosuke's life was saved tonight.

254
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,680
The killer who attacked Tamanosuke at the hospital

255
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,580
was indeed as nimble as the Edo Kid.

256
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:30,180
Yes. Everything began with the Edo Kid!

257
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,480
As you all already know, the Edo Kid is a thief

258
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,880
that is causing a commotion with his samurai-like nimble movements.

259
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,380
For the past 6 months, I'm sure he's been making an appearance

260
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,080
near the places that your troupe has journeyed.

261
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
As to that,

262
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,980
Yuri and I have already been interrogated and cleared.

263
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,680
We had legitimate alibis!

264
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,380
Are you two the only ones in this troupe that can do acrobatics?

265
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,680
Yes, although Mr. Tajima is the one who taught me.

266
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Mr. Tajima hurt his back

267
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,080
and hasn't done acrobatics for three years already.

268
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Now, Tamanosuke tried to force

269
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,780
the creation of the play of the Edo Kid this time.

270
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,180
However, the script that Mr. Chikaishi had completed

271
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,180
was not what Tamanosuke had desired.

272
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,880
Why did Mr. Chikaishi change the story?

273
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,380
That was because while he was researching on the Edo Kid,

274
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,180
he realized the true identity of the Edo Kid.

275
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,780
Mr. Chikaishi was probably blackmailing the Edo Kid

276
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,680
in exchange for changing the contents of the script.

277
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,380
Isn't that right, Edo Kid,

278
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,180
rather, Mr. Kenzo Tajima?

279
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Mr. Tajima?

280
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,680
Then, is it a lie that he hurt his back?

281
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,280
It's probably true that he hurt it 3 years ago.

282
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,380
However, I believe it was quite cured from about 6 months ago.

283
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,580
Absurd!

284
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm not going to put up with listening to your story!

285
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm sorry,

286
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,080
but could we have you stay seated for just a while longer?

287
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,780
Mr. Tajima. Are you the killer?

288
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,180
No!

289
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,880
However, all circumstances point to the fact

290
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,180
that you are the killer.

291
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,480
What?

292
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,080
That day, you three were the only ones

293
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,480
who had a chance to kill Mr. Chikaishi.

294
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
You were all acting out two roles

295
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,580
to compensate for the lack of actors.

296
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Yuri and you finished changing in the dressing room.

297
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,580
Mr. Muraki had to change quickly

298
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,380
so he did so while heading for the pit.

299
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,780
The pit of the Beika Theater is deep.

300
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:48,480
Mr. Muraki, who had to change back into his previous costume,

301
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,580
didn't have time to commit the crime.

302
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,780
On the other hand,

303
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,080
Mr. Chikaishi's room was beside the dressing room.

304
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,880
Mr. Tajima and Yuri who had to pass

305
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,680
in front of his room in order to change outfits,

306
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,180
had time to kill Mr. Chikaishi.

307
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,180
But Itoe died accidentally.

308
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,680
It was only because she read the letters on the note

309
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,880
as Itoe, her name.

310
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,580
That note was meant for me.

311
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,480
Why do you say so?

312
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,180
That's the way the troupe leader

313
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,280
had a habit of writing from Itaro to Edo Kid.

314
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,580
That's right.

315
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,580
It was not the Roman letters for the Japanese name "Itoe",

316
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,280
but rather, it read "I To E" meaning from Itaro to the Edo Kid.

317
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Then, why did he have to pass it out to everyone?

318
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,180
How would I know?

319
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,280
Because I was enrage thinking that the troupe leader suspected me,

320
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
that I went drinking.

321
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,180
What if that note was addressed to the real Edo Kid?

322
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,980
Although Tamanosuke was certain

323
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,380
that the Edo Kid had killed Mr. Chikaishi,

324
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,080
but he wasn't sure who the Edo Kid actually was.

325
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,980
That's why he sent the note out to everyone.

326
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
However, Itoe who mistakenly thought

327
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,880
it was addressed to her, went to the theater.

328
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,580
She stepped on the trap that was set

329
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,680
and fell to her death.

330
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,080
Tamanosuke got hurt right after he entered the theater.

331
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,180
In other words, Tamanosuke had no time to set the plywood up.

332
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,280
Therefore,

333
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,680
another person had to have been in the theater at that time.

334
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,280
As evidence of that,

335
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,180
another note was found by the pit.

336
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,480
That's why you're saying I did it?

337
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,680
Just because I had the time to kill Chikaishi,

338
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,480
you can't tell whether I really killed him or not, can you?

339
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,280
-Yuri had the time, too. -Hey.

340
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,380
Mr. Tajima.

341
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,580
The man who appeared at the hospital

342
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,080
had a physique just like yours.

343
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,180
Just because our physiques look alike, do I turn out to be the killer?

344
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,280
If so, Mr. Muraki...

345
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,680
Fine.

346
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,980
Inspector, please check the fingerprints

347
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,280
on Mr. Chikaishi's computer once again.

348
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,480
What?

349
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,580
We checked it when the first murder was committed

350
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,880
but came up with nothing. Why now?

351
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,680
The killer should've operated the computer after that.

352
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,380
In order to verify the floppy

353
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,780
that he stole out of Mr. Chikaishi's room,

354
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,580
he probably touched it with his bare hands

355
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,980
thinking it would never be checked again.

356
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,880
Officer Takagi, get the Identification officer.

357
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,880
-Yes, sir. -Okay. Enough.

358
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,980
I did indeed kill Chikaishi and Itoe.

359
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,680
I was relieved that Chikaishi who had figured out

360
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
the true identity of the Edo Kid was dead.

361
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,680
But I found that note in my pocket.

362
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,480
I was instantly enraged,

363
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
and without much thought, went to set up the trap.

364
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,780
But after Itoe died, I snapped back to myself,

365
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,480
and was hiding the plywood,

366
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,380
when I found Tamanosuke standing there.

367
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,080
I actually tried to kill Tamanosuke.

368
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,980
How could I...

369
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,580
Mr. Tajima, it's all my fault.

370
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,180
Just because I insisted on doing such a play.

371
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,080
Troupe leader...

372
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,780
I didn't intend to corner you

373
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,480
by putting on the play of the Edo Kid.

374
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,080
I just wanted you to repent your sins as soon as possible.

375
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,880
I wanted you to turn yourself in.

376
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,280
Troupe leader!

377
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,580
I'm sorry!

378
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,680
Please forgive me!

379
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,280
It was stupid of me to go to a loan shark

380
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
because I wanted money to have fun with!

381
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm sorry I threw dirt on the troupe's name!

382
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,880
Later, the theater that was closed off was opened once again,

383
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,180
and although the contents of the script were greatly altered,

384
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,380
Tamanosuke, despite his wound,

385
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,180
acted out his role on stage.

386
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
We amateurs also

387
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,380
go to make a special appearance on stage.

388
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,820
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,380
"Gin and Vodka"

390
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,000
In the next episode, the men in black will finally make their appearance.

391
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,120
I'm the "black" vacuum!
