1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,940
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,740
Flowers hold deep meaning behind them.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,840
Time is no obstacle for songs or the will to kill.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,790
We got a request for a job from Yoshinori Kana,

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,590
chairman of the Kana Amusement Group.

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,090
He asks us to attend a party and protect his wife, Misaki,

11
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,690
who is being stalked by someone.

12
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,090
There is a black out during the party.

13
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,990
Misaki is attacked in her room.

14
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,290
Suspicion falls on Gerald Tenma, the main guest of the party.

15
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,490
However, Gerald Tenma himself is killed.

16
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,090
"Nocturne of Red Will to Kill (Part 2)"

17
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,590
The murder weapon is the sword of the knight.

18
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,190
A tuning fork used for tuning the piano.

19
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,390
I wonder what this scratch is.

20
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,290
And, why is the piano chair over here?

21
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,890
It's stuck under the large sofa.

22
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,990
You stay put!

23
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,190
Please move over to the waiting room

24
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,690
so that we can keep the scene of the murder as is.

25
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,790
Gerald.

26
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,490
Yoshinori, are you the one who killed Mr.Tenma?

27
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,090
No, I didn't.

28
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,390
I was in the waiting room. Right here.

29
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,690
Tenma ignored me and went alone into the piano room.

30
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,790
Without a choice,

31
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,890
just as I was about to sit in the chair,

32
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,390
I heard a thump and a scream, so I went to look,

33
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,390
and found Tenma dead!

34
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,590
But, back then, everyone else was in the large reception room downstairs.

35
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,190
That's right, Yoshinori.

36
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,290
Of all things, what a thing to do?

37
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,790
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

38
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,890
You didn't like the fact

39
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,790
that I decided on this whole thing on my own in the first place.

40
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,090
So, when you found out that Misaki and Mr. Tenma

41
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,490
used to go with each other in the past,

42
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,890
you were enraged, weren't you?

43
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,890
Well, that's...

44
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,390
So, the Kana family is finished.

45
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,090
It's too bad, chairman.

46
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,290
I wonder who is going to be

47
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,790
taking over the Kana Amusement Group from now on?

48
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm innocent.

49
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,990
And, did you see the killer?

50
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,790
Well...

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,190
when I got there, there was already no one there.

52
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,890
When we were guided there by Misaki,

53
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,190
the lid of the piano was closed, wasn't it?

54
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,690
I wonder if Gerald opened it?

55
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,890
No, in a room this size, sound will go around,

56
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,590
Gerald would never open it.

57
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,990
Come to think of it...

58
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,290
The top lid of the piano was open

59
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,390
even before Tenma came into this room.

60
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,390
Which means that

61
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,990
the killer could've opened the top lid of the piano beforehand

62
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,990
to block our view.

63
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,390
The only way out of this room is to go through the waiting room.

64
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,490
One of the windows was open, but below it,

65
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,690
is the sea way below.

66
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,190
Even if the killer were to jump in,

67
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,090
it would be difficult to avoid the rocks.

68
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,990
There is a scratch on this window frame too.

69
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,890
It looks like a scratch made from a string or some sort.

70
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,590
It's the same as when Misaki was attacked.

71
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,490
If a rope were used, you could flee to the top or bottom.

72
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,990
Well, that is a possibility.

73
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,390
But, I wonder if one could flee so quickly?

74
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,290
A scratch made by the tip of the sword piercing right through the floor is vertical?

75
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,590
This means...

76
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,990
Maybe...

77
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,890
Let's organize the position of all of you

78
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,490
during the time of the crime, once again.

79
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,590
Let's all go to the room next door.

80
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,190
The small chandelier on this side

81
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,190
is positioned higher than the big one over there.

82
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,590
When we were led in here,

83
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,190
I'm sure it was positioned lower.

84
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,390
There is a scratch here too.

85
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,990
It resembles the one that was by the window.

86
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,890
So, this is the chain that moves the chandelier up and down.

87
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,290
I guess it's easy to roll it up.

88
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,790
Only this box has no dust on it.

89
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,590
"Nocturne of Red Love."

90
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,290
This song was one that Mr. Tenma had written for Misaki 10 years ago.

91
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,890
Wait a second.

92
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,790
So, what does this mean?

93
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,790
What's that...

94
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,090
on the piano?

95
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,290
Is it blood?

96
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,290
No.

97
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,790
Inside the piano too?

98
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,190
Officer Kobayashi.

99
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,690
What is it, Conan?

100
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,690
Lend me your ear, please.

101
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,790
What? The Inspector said to?

102
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,090
Look for Beethoven?

103
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,090
Yes.

104
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,290
Is it really inside the ocean?

105
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,390
Yes. Good luck.

106
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,890
At any rate, I'll have to have you come to the station with me.

107
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,290
I didn't do it.

108
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,490
How many times do I have to tell you to make you believe me?

109
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,490
Misaki, help me.

110
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,490
Dear.

111
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,490
If this piece fits into that part...

112
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,590
Just as I thought.

113
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,290
These are the debris from the decorations up there.

114
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,490
Only that person could've committed the murder.

115
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,290
I'll take care of the company, Yoshinori.

116
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,590
You're already thinking of

117
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,690
selling a memorial CD of Gerald Tenma, aren't you?

118
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,790
How dare you!

119
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,290
He's the one who attacked Misaki.

120
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,190
Inspector Megure.

121
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,190
Just as you have said, this statue of Beethoven was found on the beach.

122
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,690
I never asked you to do such a thing.

123
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,790
Shoots.

124
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,590
What's this?

125
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,090
There is a scratch below the railing

126
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,090
that looks to have been made by scraping a thin string or wire on it.

127
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,890
What's this?

128
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,290
What is this string called?

129
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,190
Isn't this the string that you use when fishing?

130
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,590
It's called a fishing gut.

131
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,390
Inspector, there was a fishing gut

132
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,690
and this stick on this chest statue.

133
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,290
What?

134
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,490
I see. The scratch on the railing

135
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,790
was made by the fishing gut scraping against it.

136
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,790
All right, Pops, that's the way to go.

137
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,090
But, why the statue of Beethoven?

138
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,090
See, there's Mr. Beethoven in this picture too.

139
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,390
-What is this? -That was a picture...

140
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,190
that was taken secretly from this room last night.

141
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,290
This is just about there.

142
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,290
The statue of Beethoven is not here?

143
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,290
I see, I've figured out the trick of the caped monster.

144
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,390
What?

145
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,290
Yes, the statue of Beethoven belongs in this room.

146
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,390
If this trick were to be used...

147
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,390
Don't you think that beam fits the length of the stick?

148
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,390
Hey!

149
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,990
Doesn't that piece that was found,

150
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,190
fit right into the crack over there?

151
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,890
Right. Let's try it from the balcony on the other side.

152
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,590
Would you please lend us a fishing pole if you have one?

153
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,890
Yes.

154
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,590
The eaves protrude more than the railing,

155
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,690
but if a fishing pole were used, it's simple.

156
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,690
There is a loop at the tip of the string

157
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,390
and a weight at the end to carry this out.

158
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,690
Then, pull this string under the railing...

159
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,990
Officer Kobayashi,

160
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,590
please put your finger through the loop of the fishing gut

161
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,090
and hold it in place.

162
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,590
All right.

163
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,290
Inspector Megure, may I borrow your coat?

164
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,390
So, now we're all set.

165
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,190
Officer Kobayashi, struggle with the monster

166
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,690
and let your hand go when I signal,

167
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,490
then, pull the string.

168
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,990
All right.

169
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,390
Let's begin.

170
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,790
Help me!

171
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,090
Now!

172
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,390
Pull the string!

173
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,890
Let the string go.

174
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,090
This is fantastic! It's perfect!

175
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,990
Hey. My coat!

176
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,290
That movement just now

177
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,490
was exactly the same as the attacker who attacked Misaki.

178
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,490
-Then... -Don't tell me it was you?

179
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,790
In a dark room,

180
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,390
it looked like the caped monster had fled.

181
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,390
That is, the victim and the attacker are one and the same.

182
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,590
The killer lowers the breaker that is in the corridor,

183
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,690
and goes back to her room right away, locks the door and screams.

184
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,090
Isn't that right, Misaki?

185
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,490
Misaki.

186
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,690
Perfect, just as would be expected of a renown detective.

187
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,190
However, all the pranks and blackmails I have experienced up to now

188
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,490
are a matter of fact.

189
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,490
I wanted you to believe me,

190
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,290
so I put on an act.

191
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,890
I see.

192
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,490
But, this is not directly connected to the murder of Mr. Tenma.

193
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,190
Yoshinori,

194
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,790
please come with me to the station.

195
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,290
Okay.

196
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,790
This won't do.

197
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,370
What the?

198
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,670
The piano room?

199
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,770
Conan, what's up?

200
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,070
Where are you?

201
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,370
What is it now?

202
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,870
Inspector Megure,

203
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,470
please wait about taking him to the station.

204
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,270
What?

205
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,070
So it's come?

206
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,670
Yes. I've finally figured it out, Inspector.

207
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,770
Please look at the sword mark on the floor.

208
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,270
The angle of the scratch is perpendicular.

209
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,970
The result of the investigation shows likewise..

210
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,370
And, the railing of the spiral corridor by the window.

211
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,070
The scratch left on the tuning fork that Mr. Tenma was holding.

212
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,470
If we connect all the traces left behind,

213
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,670
a certain horrible trap comes to the surface.

214
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,970
There is a chandelier right above the scratch on the floor.

215
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,170
That is in fact, the last point that connects all the traces.

216
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,770
It can't be?

217
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,170
Yes.

218
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,770
The sword that was suspended from that chandelier

219
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,570
fell straight down, pierced Mr. Tenma

220
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,870
and left a vertical mark on the floor.

221
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,170
Oh, no.

222
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,770
But, Mr. Mouri,

223
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,470
even if he were to be standing conveniently right under the place

224
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,570
where the sword descended,

225
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,370
wouldn't he have been stabbed in the head or shoulder?

226
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,270
However, Mr. Tenma was lying on his stomach.

227
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,870
No such thing could be done.

228
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,670
The answer to that mystery is the tuning fork.

229
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,970
Tuning fork?

230
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,670
And, the piano chair.

231
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,370
The space between the piano and the chair

232
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,370
is good only for one person.

233
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,070
This was the trap.

234
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,770
When Mr. Tenma comes before the keys of the piano to play,

235
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,770
the chair was toppled beside the piano.

236
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,070
He also finds the tuning fork used for tuning the piano on the floor.

237
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,970
Well, Mr. Tenma would naturally go to pick it up.

238
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,970
Yeah, if so, he would turn his back against the sword.

239
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,270
And, the tuning fork that he picked up

240
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,070
is the very thing that made the sword come falling.

241
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,770
What do you mean?

242
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,870
This horrible trap...

243
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,670
was set up by setting the sword in the middle of the long string,

244
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,470
then gathering both sides of the string,

245
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,170
pulling them through the metal faster of the chandelier

246
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,470
using the railing of the spiral corridor as support,

247
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,170
one side is wound once around the large sofa

248
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,770
then the tip of the string is hooked on to the tuning fork.

249
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,670
The other end of the string is left outside the window,

250
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,170
with a weight attached to it.

251
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,370
All that's left to do next

252
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,870
is for Mr. Tenma to pull it out from under the chair.

253
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,570
The string that was hooked on to the tuning fork is released

254
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,170
by the weight of the sword,

255
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,570
And the heavy sword probably came falling in an instant.

256
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,570
On the other hand, the fishing gut that was holding the sword in place,

257
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,470
was pulled by the weight that was suspended outside the window

258
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,770
and dropped into the ocean below.

259
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,370
I see.

260
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,570
And, who is the one who set all this up?

261
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,470
Please recall.

262
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,470
The trick is using the fishing gut.

263
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,570
The method of throwing the evidence into the sea by using heavy weight,

264
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,270
is exactly like the one that used with the caped monster

265
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,470
that was just demonstrated, is it not?

266
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,770
Misaki?

267
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,370
Yes, the killer is you, Misaki.

268
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,770
After we all drank the wine,

269
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,370
you pretend to go to the kitchen and set your trap up here, didn't you?

270
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,870
By rolling the chandelier to the very top,

271
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,670
you made it harder to find the sword,

272
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,670
as well as heightened the power of it to kill, right?

273
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,070
I thought you were a renown detective

274
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,070
but I guess I was wrong.

275
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,570
Do you have proof that I did it?

276
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,370
I'd like you to take a look at the lid of the top of the piano

277
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,270
and the stains inside it.

278
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,870
This is wine?

279
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,170
Judging from the place where it is spilled,

280
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,070
it must've dripped when she opened the lid.

281
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,870
The one who spilled the wine is the killer.

282
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,170
How can you be so sure?

283
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,170
Because the wine is what Michelle brought from France

284
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,770
and one that is not sold in Japan.

285
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,770
Yes, this is unmistakably the wine that I brought.

286
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,370
We were all drinking that wine.

287
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,570
Misaki is the only one who didn't drink it.

288
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,170
When I bumped into her and the wine spilled,

289
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,470
the wine that was probably left in the gap of her brooch spilled out

290
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,770
when she opened the lid on top of the piano.

291
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,970
You not only made it look like you were attacked by Mr. Tenma,

292
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,070
you set it up so that the picture of you two in the past would be found,

293
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,670
and tried to frame Yoshinori who you knew would be enraged

294
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,170
as the one who killed Mr. Tenma, isn't that right?

295
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,970
Misaki, is that true?

296
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,770
How are you going to explain the stalker incidents before all this.

297
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,870
She probably acted it out herself.

298
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,570
The crank call that came a while ago

299
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,270
was probably made by Misaki herself, using her cellular.

300
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,670
Why would Misaki want to kill Mr. Tenma?

301
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,970
The date of the picture that was found of Misaki and Mr. Tenma

302
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,970
was only six months before her marriage, wasn't it?

303
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,670
It can't be?

304
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,370
And the "Nocturne of Red Love"

305
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,670
was a song that was written for you, 10 year ago.

306
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,970
Really?

307
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,370
The song at first glance looks to be a love song.

308
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,370
But the passions that the flowers stand for are,

309
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,870
Red roses symbolize passion,

310
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,870
marigolds hopelessness, roberias evil,

311
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,870
and dahlias betrayal.

312
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,070
In other words, this was a song of hate written

313
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,070
for someone who had betrayed one's lover.

314
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,870
Is that true, Misaki?

315
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,970
Yes.

316
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,670
10 years ago on that day...

317
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,670
He insisted on not leaving me,

318
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,370
so I called him out to a nearby beach

319
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,370
and pushed him over the cliff.

320
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,870
Then, you married Yoshinori.

321
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,470
However, Mr. Tenma miraculously made it out alive,

322
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,370
and achieved his fame abroad.

323
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,470
When you found out Gerald Tenma's true identity,

324
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,170
you figured you had no choice but to kill Tenma again,

325
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:55,070
in order to keep your previous crime from being revealed.

326
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:01,070
But, why did you try to frame your husband as the killer?

327
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,370
Because of Masayo!

328
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,870
If I get caught,

329
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,570
my husband as well as the company will be taken away.

330
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,970
But a man who is in prison cannot be taken away from me.

331
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,870
I was planning to take over the company until he came back.

332
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,770
Misaki.

333
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,870
When Mr. Tenma's body wasn't found 10 years ago,

334
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,270
I was always in fear that he may be alive.

335
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,370
Because I also knew the meaning of that song.

336
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,870
Well, the fact is, whenever Gerald sang this song at his concert,

337
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,270
he would whisper the following phrase without fail.

338
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,470
"Pour compenser ton coeur blesse."

339
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,270
In English it means,

340
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,970
"To compensate your heart that is hurt."

341
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,370
The new arrangement had new lyrics,

342
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,570
but most probably...

343
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,870
Yes! Except for red roses,

344
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,270
the flowers have all been changed to, hyacinth, laurel tree and olive.

345
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,770
The flowers stand for sadness, peace and glory.

346
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,270
I see.

347
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,770
Mr. Tenma having realized that he had cornered Misaki

348
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,670
into committing murder,

349
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,070
continued singing this song with feelings of compensation,

350
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,070
and probably deliberately decided to sign a contract with the Kana Group.

351
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,070
Yes, he once fell to the pits of grief,

352
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,870
but he no longer hated Misaki

353
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,670
and having achieved success and happiness himself,

354
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,970
he probably wanted her to hear the real "Nocturne of Red Love."

355
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,570
"Mouri Detective Agency" -That's right.

356
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,270
I've been hooked on what flowers stand for since then.

357
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,670
Okay then, Sonoko, bye-bye.

358
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,870
Conan, you're back.

359
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,570
Here, I saw this at the flower shop, so I bought it.

360
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,770
You, Conan? For me?

361
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,170
Thank you.

362
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,870
What beautiful peach blossoms.

363
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,070
This flower stands for...

364
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,870
To be unrivaled in the world.

365
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,170
Conan, just what do you mean by this?

366
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,770
Well, you see...

367
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,170
Just what do you mean-to be unrivaled in the world?

368
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,570
Just that...

369
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

370
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,440
"Alphabet"

371
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,520
Next time is a nine story building.

372
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,760
Lots of the Youth Detective Squad.

373
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:10,780
What about my appearance?
Lots of the Youth Detective Squad.

374
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,080
What about my appearance?
