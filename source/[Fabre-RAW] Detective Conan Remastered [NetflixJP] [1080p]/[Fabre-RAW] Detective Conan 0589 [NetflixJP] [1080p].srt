"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:06,312
By the way, Ran...

3
00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:07,412
Yeah?

4
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:10,912
The long weekend is coming up, isn't it?

5
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:12,012
Let's see.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,912
Monday the 11th is Health and Sports Day,

7
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,812
so it's a three-day weekend.

8
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:20,012
Why? Why? Are you taking us somewhere over the long weekend?

9
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:22,812
Nope, I was just asking.

10
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:24,312
Is that so?

11
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,712
Hey, if we don't hurry, we're going to miss the raffle.

12
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:31,212
You're right.

13
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:34,512
If you're going to the raffle, take my wallet.

14
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,012
I've saved up quite a few raffle tickets.

15
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,412
Got it.

16
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,812
Brooding over passing seasons

17
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:01,712
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

18
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,312
The birthday of the lady that Kogoro is not good at handling.

19
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:05,412
Kogoro's great present strategy.

20
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:07,111
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,912
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

"The Worst Birthday (Part 1)"

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
It's true.

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,860
There are almost 20 raffle tickets in here.

26
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,960
I wonder what he bought.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Maybe the receipts are in his wallet?

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I do see some receipts,

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,660
but they're all for the snacks to go with his beer.

30
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,157
"Receipt" -Here it is.

31
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,660
50,000 yen!

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,163
Beika Jewelry Shop... A necklace?

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,760
Don't tell me that dad

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,960
is going around supporting some bar waitress?

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,860
Maybe it's a birthday present for someone.

36
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Birthday? Mine's still way off.

37
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,460
If it's not for you, then it must be for...

38
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,060
That's it! October 10th is mom's birthday!

39
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,560
That must be it!

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,060
He was checking the date a while ago.

41
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,560
I bet dad must've remembered mom's birthday.

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,160
So do I.

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,560
Because you'd always mention it at school sports day as a child.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,960
October 10th is my mom's birthday.

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,660
I'll win the first place and give her the red ribbon as present!

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,860
As you'd say.

47
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,660
So, did he give us his wallet and let us find the receipt

48
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,760
because he wants us to arrange a situation

49
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,160
that would make it easier for him to give mom the present?

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Pretty smooth, Pops.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,460
But, what should I do to ensure they meet each other?

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,225
As usual, you can invite them to have a meal together.

53
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,260
The usual way won't do. It has got to be special.

54
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,360
Then, how about something like that?

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,233
"1st Prize: Shizuoka Seaside Hotel Stay For Two"

56
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,560
A hotel stay for two.

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,237
All right! Leave it to me.

58
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,260
What?

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,060
You won tickets for a free hotel stay?

60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,247
Even better, it comes with an exquisite dinner!

61
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,260
What tremendous luck she has.

62
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,760
It seems all right to bring Conan along so long as I ask.

63
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,960
So the three of us will go this weekend, all right?

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,259
-Yeah. -Of course.

65
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,660
Be sure to bring everything you need.

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,265
All right.

67
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,269
"Law Eri Kisaki" -A hotel stay in Shizuoka next weekend?

68
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:54,260
Is this another scheme to pair me up with that mustached old man?

69
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,360
Bingo, exactly!

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,060
Sorry, but I have an appointment with someone for work next Monday.

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,560
Why do you think dad was able to get so many tickets

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,287
to win the hotel stay?

73
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,560
It's because he spent 50,000 yen to buy a necklace.

74
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,160
I bet it's a birthday present for someone.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,060
But I guess it's too bad.

76
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,560
It can't be helped if you already have an appointment.

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Wait... Wait a second!

78
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,760
If it's Shizuoka we're talking about, it'll be perfect.

79
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,305
The person I'm meeting on Monday is from Shizuoka

80
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:29,860
and I was actually supposed to meet her there.

81
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,313
Then, we'll meet you next Sunday at Shizuoka Seaside Hotel.

82
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,321
Attorney, you're supposed to meet your client here, right?

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,860
Isn't it fine?

84
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,460
Since I'm taking the trouble to go and meet her personally.

85
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,560
"10th October"

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,160
Well? I'm here at the hotel.

87
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,360
What should I do now?

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,260
Just relax for a bit before dinner time.

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,660
I think dad will give you the present before or right after the meal.

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,860
After that, maybe you two can spend the night together in his room.

91
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,660
The two of us? What will you be doing, then?

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,060
Conan and I will spend the night in your room.

93
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,760
Right, Conan?

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,760
Looks like someone's here. I have to go.

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Mom.

96
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,365
Happy birthday.

97
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,460
Thank you.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,160
Oh, Mrs. Kokubu.

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,760
Our meeting was scheduled for tomorrow.

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,360
My husband came with me and we ended up having a fight.

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,381
"Akiho Kokubu (28), Client" -I'm sorry...

102
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,385
but do you mind if I stay here tonight?

103
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,389
I don't mind sleeping on the sofa.

104
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,760
But, prior to tomorrow's settlement negotiations,

105
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,060
wouldn't it be best if you discuss everything with your husband?

106
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,397
I already told you.

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,760
I don't want to stay near that dork.

108
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,405
But you're the one dealing with the stalker problem.

109
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,160
We need to talk over the amount of consolation money

110
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,260
as well as the terms for the out-of-court settlement.

111
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,760
Hello, this is Kisaki, the attorney speaking.

112
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,421
Is this Mrs. Akiho Kokubu's room?

113
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,860
Yes. This is Akiho's husband, Takehiko speaking.

114
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,060
A moment ago, your wife came to my room, Number 306,

115
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,960
and she has fallen asleep.

116
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,060
I'll be going out and won't return until 11.00 pm.

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,160
Would you mind coming by to get her at some point?

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,960
"Takehiko Kokubu (30)" -I think she'll cool off...

119
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,443
"Akiho's Husband" -after she's slept off her drunkenness.

120
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,445
Yes, I understand.

121
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,860
Oh, my. Attorney.

122
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,260
I'm counting on you during tomorrow's negotiations.

123
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
"Midori Hino (51)" -Since it seems to be true that my son

124
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,360
"Opposing Party In The Negotiation" -has been following the woman,

125
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,463
we'll pay the extent of the settlement fee.

126
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,560
But this all started because that former race queen tricked

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,469
and toyed with my son's feelings.

128
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,760
I intend to give her a piece of my mind about it.

129
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,260
Well, let's talk about it tomorrow.

130
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,260
I take it that your son's not here with you, correct?

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,460
That's a requirement for our negotiation.

132
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,487
No, I didn't bring him.

133
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,960
But who knows whether he'd followed me here...

134
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,260
"Seiji Hino (26), Midori's Son" -on his own or not.

135
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,860
Geez! We haven't seen each other for so long.

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,060
Couldn't you wear something sexier than this?

137
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,760
Well, it seems you aren't surprised that I showed up here.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,060
Yeah. Judging from the way Ran was talking,

139
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,960
I expected a certain old lady would be coming along.

140
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,160
Ran, apologies, but will it be all right if I leave now?

141
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,519
Now, now! Since all of us are already here,

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,060
let's just enjoy this exquisite dinner.

143
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,560
This old guy. Is he even planning to give her a present?

144
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,060
The food is really delicious, isn't it?

145
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,160
Yes, it really is.

146
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,760
It's totally different from someone's cooking.

147
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,960
That reminds me of the last time the three of us had a meal together.

148
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,060
It was my birthday, wasn't it?

149
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,660
Right?

150
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
Yeah.

151
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Was it?

152
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:42,960
Anyway, isn't this restaurant a little warm?

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,060
What's this?

154
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,360
Mom, you aren't wearing anything around your neck.

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,060
Yeah, I haven't found an accessory I like.

156
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,573
Why don't you try wearing a collar, then?

157
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,060
Just like the one your cat's wearing.

158
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,583
Bear with it. He says things like that, but I bet he's just teasing you

159
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,860
and waiting for the final moment of your birthday to give it to you.

160
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,160
Hey, dad.

161
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,860
He's passed out.

162
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,960
There's only an hour left of my birthday.

163
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:27,860
Sorry, but I'll head back to the room now.

164
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,611
Of course, I do mean my own room.

165
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,960
Gosh.

166
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,160
Looks like Mrs. Kokubu has left.

167
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,960
But what was all that about?

168
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,560
The necklace that man bought.

169
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,637
Could it be that he's being duped by some woman?

170
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,660
Oh, goodness.

171
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,360
Looks like I don't have a choice.

172
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,960
Seriously, what a terrible birthday.

173
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,360
I'll ask again. Why should I apologize to her?

174
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,160
Because there's something you haven't given her.

175
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,360
It's all right. There are still three minutes left.

176
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,660
Huh? Is mom asleep?

177
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,060
Yes, who's there?

178
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,060
It's me. I've got something to tell you.

179
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,360
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

180
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,960
It has to be done today. Please let me in.

181
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,260
Gosh. What is it?

182
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,960
Why are you dressed like that, idiot?

183
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,160
I was taking a shower. Does that bug you?

184
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Well? What do you want to talk about?

185
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,060
If it's about that mustached old man,

186
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,560
I have nothing to say.

187
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,460
Mrs. Kokubu? Hang in there!

188
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,460
Mrs. Kokubu? Mrs. Kokubu!

189
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:23,496
The estimated time of death is between 10.00 pm and 11.00 pm.

190
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,996
Her death was caused by blunt force.

191
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,796
She was struck on the back of the head with a blunt object.

192
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:32,731
However, we have yet to locate the murder weapon.

193
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:37,096
So, are you and the victim acquainted?

194
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:39,396
Well, Attorney...

195
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:41,796
I'm Eri Kisaki.

196
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:44,743
She was a client of mine.

197
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,196
Her name is Akiho Kokubu.

198
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,396
She was dealing with a stalker problem.

199
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:50,749
We had planned to conduct

200
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,751
a settlement negotiation in this room tomorrow.

201
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,296
Why was she in your room?

202
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:58,496
She was staying in this hotel with her husband,

203
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:01,596
and the two had a dispute around sundown.

204
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:05,296
That's when she said she wanted to stay in my room,

205
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,896
and she fell asleep here.

206
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:11,696
Of course, I made a call to her husband who was in his room.

207
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:14,096
I told him I'd be out of the room until 11.00 pm

208
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,296
and asked him to pick her up when it was convenient for him.

209
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,796
And judging by the fact that she wasn't here

210
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:22,496
when I returned shortly after 11.00 pm,

211
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:25,996
I was fairly sure that her husband had come to get her.

212
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:28,296
Hold on a second, please!

213
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:30,789
Are you absolutely certain that there was nobody here

214
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,996
when you returned to this room?

215
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,796
Yes.

216
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:38,096
The door to this room is auto-locked.

217
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:41,296
Without the keycard, no one could've come in from outside!

218
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:45,796
Also, the window is designed so that no one can go through it.

219
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:48,807
There wasn't a body here when you came back to the room.

220
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,496
And yet, you claim that

221
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,496
a body suddenly appeared after you took a shower.

222
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,496
That makes this a locked room murder!

223
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:58,817
It's an impossible crime!

224
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:01,296
Or perhaps the truth is that you returned to the room

225
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,296
and had an argument with the victim.

226
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:07,296
Therefore, you killed her in a fit of anger.

227
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,396
What?

228
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:12,196
Then, while you were taking a shower to clean the blood on you,

229
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:15,096
Mr. Mouri arrived.

230
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:18,396
If that was the case, wouldn't I have refused to let him in?

231
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:21,296
Precisely. Utilizing reverse psychology,

232
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:25,696
you invited the great Detective Mouri inside.

233
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:29,596
It's all to make a simple crime appear impossible.

234
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:30,849
Listen...

235
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:36,296
Regardless, it's possible that you still have a weapon on you.

236
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,296
I'll call a female officer to conduct a full body search.

237
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:41,196
That won't be necessary.

238
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,863
I already stripped her completely in the bathroom

239
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,865
and checked her thoroughly.

240
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,996
Strip... Stripped her completely?

241
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:51,396
Yeah.

242
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,396
She was only wearing a bath towel,

243
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:55,896
so that's all I had to remove.

244
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,496
No... What I'm saying is...

245
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,879
That's sexual harassment!

246
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,496
-It's fine. -What?

247
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:04,396
We're a married couple.

248
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,296
But we're living separately.

249
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,396
Married... A married couple?

250
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,596
But your name...

251
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:14,893
Kisaki is my mom's maiden name.

252
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,196
She only uses it for professional purposes.

253
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:20,899
Oh, my. So you're his wife.

254
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,901
We finally got to meet each other.

255
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,096
Finally?

256
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:28,296
You see, every time Mr. Mouri is with a beautiful woman,

257
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:31,996
I mistake the woman for his wife.

258
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,913
Idiot! You talk too much!

259
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,917
But in any case, your statement will be considered a family testimony

260
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,796
and can't be admitted into the investigation.

261
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:44,923
On the other hand, we'll have to consider the possibility

262
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,896
that you two conspired together to destroy any evidence.

263
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,896
Hey, hey, Yokomizo.

264
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,096
Because if that isn't the case,

265
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:55,896
we can't really explain this locked room mystery.

266
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,896
There's even a blood stain over there.

267
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:03,496
Take a look at the bottom of the bed sheet.

268
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,596
Blood?

269
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:09,896
But why isn't there any blood on the carpet below?

270
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:12,196
Could it be that the bed was moved,

271
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:13,896
and that's why the blood stain is there?

272
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:16,196
It was done to hide the body.

273
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,396
That's possible.

274
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,096
The culprit concealed the body by moving the bed

275
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:23,396
and hid right beside the body.

276
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,596
And while I was taking a shower,

277
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:28,967
he moved the bed back into position to reveal the body,

278
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,996
and he escaped from this room unnoticed.

279
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:35,496
But if you hadn't taken a shower,

280
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,696
the culprit wouldn't have been able to use that trick.

281
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:42,981
Yeah, if you had gone to bed in a drooling mess as usual,

282
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,696
the culprit would have been all out of luck.

283
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:48,996
Drooling? Aren't you talking about yourself?

284
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:51,596
That mess wasn't from drooling.

285
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,896
It was from coke, right?

286
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:56,196
See, there are spots on the carpet in front of the fridge

287
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:58,596
that seem to be coke stains.

288
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:01,896
And I can still see a pool of coke

289
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,796
on the lid of the can sitting on top of the fridge.

290
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,005
-Is that true? -Yes.

291
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
I decided to drink it after I came back,

292
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,009
but it sprayed all over me.

293
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:15,596
And I forgot I had put it on the refrigerator.

294
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:20,496
But don't you usually only drink water, tea or coffee?

295
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:24,596
The only drink available inside was carbonated drink.

296
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:29,027
Anyway, if the body was hidden under the bed,

297
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:33,396
there must have been at least two culprits.

298
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,596
Why is that so?

299
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,196
It would be quite difficult for one person to lift

300
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:41,039
and move something this heavy.

301
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,096
There aren't any skid marks on the carpet either.

302
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,296
There are blood stains by the foot of the bed.

303
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,896
The large ones are most likely from the blood splattered

304
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:51,596
when the victim was struck.

305
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,496
But what's with these small ones in the foreground

306
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:57,696
that are equally spaced and gradually fade?

307
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,996
Inspector Yokomizo!

308
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,061
We discovered that shortly before the time of the crime around 9:30 pm,

309
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:07,065
several calls were made to this room.

310
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,196
-Is that so? -Wasn't it the victim's husband...

311
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,596
who was asked to come pick her up?

312
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:15,796
One of the calls was from the victim's Room 309,

313
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,796
so that must be true.

314
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,496
However, another call was made from Room 302.

315
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,196
Room 302?

316
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,096
It's Mrs. Hino's room.

317
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,596
You know that?

318
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:27,085
Yeah.

319
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:31,089
She's the mother of the stalker I told you earlier.

320
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:34,896
But why would she call this room?

321
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,796
My wife was murdered?

322
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,396
Who... Who did it? And why?

323
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:43,101
We're currently investigating that.

324
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:47,796
But why didn't you pick your wife up?

325
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:51,396
I did call and say I'd pick her up,

326
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:55,113
but she bellowed that she wouldn't let me in even if I came over.

327
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:58,496
That why despite feeling sorry to the attorney, I thought it'd be best

328
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,596
for her to keep my wife in her room for the night

329
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:04,596
so I could come by in the morning after she cooled down.

330
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:06,896
What was the cause of your argument?

331
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,696
Well, it was...

332
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,496
Was it about this?

333
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:13,131
Conan.

334
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,596
It's a bunch of mini cars.

335
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:20,896
I've loved cars since I was a kid,

336
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:23,141
and lining them up helps me feel calm.

337
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:26,696
But how could this have caused the fight?

338
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,296
See.

339
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:31,149
The side mirror was tossed onto the floor.

340
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:35,153
A man who loves cars wouldn't do something this violent, right?

341
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,155
So your wife did this?

342
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,496
Yeah. She told me to quit this childish and disgusting hobby

343
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:41,996
and threw it.

344
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:46,196
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

345
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:52,396
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

346
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:53,996
This Porsche.

347
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:59,996
By the way, was it only you and your wife in this room?

348
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:04,496
Yeah. I'd only let show this kind of hobby to my wife.

349
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,096
That woman was murdered?

350
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:12,596
Well, I've always figured one of the foolish men she deceived

351
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:16,296
would eventually kill her.

352
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:20,196
On that note, it's my understanding that you called the victim.

353
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:24,296
Yeah, I called the attorney to see

354
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:27,205
if we could slightly change the time of our negotiation tomorrow.

355
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:30,596
But I was shocked when that woman picked up the phone.

356
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:34,096
Why did you wish to change the time?

357
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:38,596
The golf appointment I had with a friend got moved up.

358
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:41,219
So you plan to play golf soon after

359
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:42,996
your stalker son's settlement negotiations.

360
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:44,296
Why not?

361
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:47,696
After all, there's a good golf course nearby.

362
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:51,229
By the way, are you staying in this room by yourself?

363
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,396
Yes, that right.

364
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:54,796
Can't you tell this is a single room?

365
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,896
There's another occupant in this room.

366
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,196
What?

367
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:04,196
There aren't lipstick marks on these cigarette butts.

368
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:08,996
And the filter is still damp.

369
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:10,796
It really is.

370
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:12,396
Is that right?

371
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,796
That's enough, Seiji!

372
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:18,496
Get out here!

373
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:23,596
So that's your stalker son?

374
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:26,296
I told you that my son was only deceived.

375
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:30,996
But you were instructed not to bring your son here, were you not?

376
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:34,796
Well, he happened to be here

377
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:37,275
because he'll be touring with his friends

378
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,596
on their bikes tomorrow morning.

379
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,296
Then show us that bike.

380
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:43,596
Right here.

381
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:47,996
Look.

382
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,196
A road bike?

383
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:56,296
But, why did you hide your son?

384
00:21:56,296 --> 00:22:00,896
I thought that woman called the police to arrest my son, so...

385
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:04,696
Incidentally, please tell us your whereabouts and what you did

386
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,296
between 10.00 pm and 11.00 pm.

387
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:09,296
I was drinking with my mom.

388
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:11,896
If you think we're lying, verify it yourself.

389
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,696
We were at the hotel lounge on the top floor.

390
00:22:15,896 --> 00:22:21,319
Attorney Kisaki's client, Akiho Kokubu was murdered in her room.

391
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:23,321
There are three suspects.

392
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,896
Akiho's husband, Takehiko Kokubu.

393
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:30,396
The man who stalked Akiho, Seiji Hino.

394
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:33,331
And his mother, Midori Hino.

395
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:37,335
The person who murdered Akiho Kokubu

396
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:40,396
should be among these three people.

397
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,882
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,032
"Sports Day"

399
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:07,888
She became a suspect on her own birthday!

400
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,416
Conan, hurry up and solve the case!

401
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,940
Got it... Me?
