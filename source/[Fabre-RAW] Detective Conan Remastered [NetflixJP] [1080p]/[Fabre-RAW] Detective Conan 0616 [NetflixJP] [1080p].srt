1
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:07,702
Darn it! I lost again?

2
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:09,989
Talk about a bum day...

3
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:14,002
Geez! Just when I'm imagining basking

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,995
in a tropical paradise enjoying my fruit parfait!

5
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,002
Why don't you go read the derby papers

6
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,602
back at the detective agency?

7
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,902
The strawberry looks delicious!

8
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,102
I'll eat it if you don't want to eat it!

9
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:29,802
No! I saved it to eat it last!

10
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:31,502
Oh, come on.

11
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:34,002
-I said, no! -Ouch...

12
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:40,702
Yes, this strawberry was what triggered it.

13
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:43,802
I could never have imagined it at this time.

14
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:46,025
That this would be the start of

15
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:49,002
a bitter sweet serious case.

16
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:53,002
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,

17
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,302
you must be true to yourself.

18
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,102
Finally a great leap out of Japan.

19
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,302
A serious case occurs in the most adored city of London.

20
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,002
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:03,102
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:05,302
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:52,151
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Holmes's Disciple)"

24
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,155
Oh boy! I was looking forward to eating it!

25
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,839
What's with this cat?

26
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,139
I didn't know cats ate strawberries?

27
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,939
I think it's just rolling it around and playing with it.

28
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,339
Who does this cat belong to anyway?

29
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,239
Why you!

30
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,239
Oh, Peanuts!

31
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,339
Peanuts!

32
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,139
I'm glad you're unhurt!

33
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,739
Thank you so much for finding her!

34
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,189
It seems like she saying thank you.

35
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,191
My father is a detective.

36
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,939
Really? How admirable!

37
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,739
I'm fond of crime novels myself!

38
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,739
And I love to hear stories,

39
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,203
but I've got a flight to catch. Such a shame.

40
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,207
I know, may I invite you to my home

41
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,639
in London?

42
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:53,739
-What's she saying? -I wonder.

43
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,215
She talks so fast that I couldn't make it out.

44
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,739
Wow, that's great!

45
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,939
Oh, you accept?

46
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,439
Then when can you visit?

47
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,639
We don't have school next weekend!

48
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,231
Oh, good. Then, I'll arrange your trip as soon as I return home.

49
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,839
He speaks English?

50
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,235
It seems so.

51
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,239
-Okay? -Sure! All right!

52
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,739
Thank you, ma'am!

53
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,245
You're going to England next weekend?

54
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,239
Hey, hey. What about school?

55
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:32,539
Well, Teitan Elementary as well as High school

56
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,539
is anniversary day, and since it falls on a Saturday,

57
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,539
we have four consecutive days off from school.

58
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,439
Ran and Pops were all for it.

59
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,539
Moreover, the owner of the cat,

60
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:45,839
Diana turned out to be super rich!

61
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,239
She says that she's going to pay all of our air fare

62
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,439
and hotel charges, too!

63
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,639
Well, aren't you lucky though,

64
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,039
getting to go to London where you always wanted to go.

65
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,539
Yeah, father took me a lot of places abroad,

66
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:00,639
but I've never been to London yet!

67
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,539
First, I'd like to go to Baker Street.

68
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,439
Then next to Hyde Park where Holmes

69
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,739
and Watson are said to have had walks in!

70
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,039
And then to the Great Britain Museum

71
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,291
where Holmes is said to have frequented whenever looking up reference!

72
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,739
And if I still have time,

73
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,739
I want to go to Dartmoor that was the stage

74
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,239
for "The Hound of Baskervilles"

75
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,939
and Reichenbach Falls where Holmes fell from together

76
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,439
with his arch enemy Professor Moriarty.

77
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,839
I've got so many places I want to go to

78
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,305
that I don't know what to do!

79
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,307
But...

80
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:32,039
what about your passport?

81
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,939
I completely forgot about it!

82
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,319
Remember, Conan Edogawa is the child image of Shinichi Kudo

83
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,321
who was made to drink the drug!

84
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,039
He's actually someone that doesn't exist, you know!

85
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,039
What makes you think that you can travel abroad so easily

86
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,329
given the situation you're in?

87
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,739
That's true, but...

88
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,639
Hey, Doc!

89
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,739
Isn't there anything you can do about it,

90
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,139
like make a fake passport of something!

91
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,939
Don't be ridiculous! That's a crime!

92
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,939
Darn it! My chance to go to Holmes' sacred land,

93
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,639
but I have to stay and watch house!

94
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,639
That's ridiculous. Darn it.

95
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,353
There's one way that you could go, though.

96
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:20,359
That is, if you promise to keep to your word with me, though.

97
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:34,373
Wow, first class is so spacious!

98
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,739
How rich is that lady, anyway?

99
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,739
Too bad Conan couldn't come with us too, though.

100
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:46,139
Yeah. Something about coming up

101
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,539
with an urgent matter all of a sudden.

102
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,639
But I guess he'll be coming

103
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,391
with Dr. Agasa on the next flight, either way so...

104
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,393
To go as far as to pay for Doc's air fare too.

105
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,739
Diana's really a nice person, isn't she?

106
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,039
But she's not paying for the gifts,

107
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,399
so don't go splurging!

108
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,939
Huh?

109
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:04,403
You're going to splurge an entire mountain

110
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,139
on that Holmes freak, aren't you?

111
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,739
I... I don't intend to buy an entire mountain, so there!

112
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:11,939
I'll bet he would've wanted to come,

113
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,413
rather than receive gifts or anything, though.

114
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,939
Really. It would've been nice if Shinichi could come too.

115
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,639
I think the air conditioner is too strong in this plane.

116
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,439
Hey! You've got to keep yourself from standing out now!

117
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,439
We don't want Ran folks finding out

118
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,239
that we're on the same plane, you know.

119
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,939
No need to worry, they're flying first class!

120
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,441
They won't be coming this way.

121
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,739
You're sure lucky thanks to Ai's great idea.

122
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:49,739
Returning your body to Shinichi Kudo

123
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:52,239
temporarily to pass leaving the country.

124
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,839
Yeah, I'm grateful.

125
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,139
I'm only giving you two tablets, understand?

126
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,459
One for going and the other for coming back!

127
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,939
And they're effective only for 24 hours!

128
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,239
Drink the tablet calculating the time backwards

129
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,339
to when you finish going through customs in England

130
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,339
to when your body returns to what you look like now!

131
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,039
But, are you sure you'll be okay,

132
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
with me taking Doc along?

133
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,479
Yes. I'll stay over at the Yoshida's.

134
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,481
Sorry.

135
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,483
I'm sure you know,

136
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,139
but if you drink it without spacing the time,

137
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,039
the effectiveness of the drug will be reduced to half

138
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,239
and on top of that, you won't ever be able to come back!

139
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,493
Yes, yes.

140
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,739
"Heathrow Airport England"

141
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,939
Conan and Doc aren't coming out.

142
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,839
Their plane should've landed long ago and yet...

143
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,511
Ran!

144
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,513
Conan?

145
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,239
When did you come out?

146
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:59,339
Just a while ago. You didn't see us?

147
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,839
The drug didn't wear off for a while,

148
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,439
so I had to stay confined in the restroom for 30 minutes.

149
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:08,539
Okay, then. Since we still have time

150
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,531
before we meet the rich lady at the hotel tonight, so...

151
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,439
Why don't we go on a London city tour?

152
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:17,939
Where do you want to go, Conan?

153
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,939
Of course I want to go to!

154
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:22,539
"Sherlock Holmes Museum"

155
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,239
Just as would be expected of the Sherlock Holmes Museum!

156
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:32,139
Awesome!

157
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,739
Can I take this seat?

158
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,439
Of course!

159
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,557
All right!

160
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,739
I'll bet Shinichi would be just as excited.

161
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:53,039
He wrote that he didn't want any gifts in his mail.

162
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,756
I mean I'm all out to get him something so!

163
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:58,577
Okay. I guess I'll surprise him a bit!

164
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,585
It's Shinichi's cell phone.

165
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,587
I wonder who it is?

166
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:11,672
Ran?

167
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,597
Hello, Shinichi?

168
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:20,599
Ran.

169
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,072
Where do you think I am now?

170
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:26,605
At Baker Street 221-B!

171
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,372
Come to think of it, you wrote in your mail

172
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,172
that you'd be going to London.

173
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,372
What? What's with that indifferent reaction of yours?

174
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:37,272
I wish you would envy me a bit.

175
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,972
Sorry. I'm busy right now, you see.

176
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,623
Would you like me to take pictures of certain places?

177
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,472
I'm not sure what places you'd like pictures of...

178
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:50,629
I told you I don't want anything like that, didn't I?

179
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,072
Besides, I'm already here.

180
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:57,572
Bye then! I'm hanging up.

181
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:59,572
What's with you, Shinichi, you punk!

182
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:02,272
Dumb-dumb...

183
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:08,072
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:11,172
Just what're you doing?

185
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,672
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,772
Oh no. I got her angry.

187
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,663
Are you leaving already?

188
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:28,072
Yeah. I've had my fill

189
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:30,669
and the gift shop is in the house next door.

190
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:34,072
Well, if Holmes were really here,

191
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,972
I would stick around for days, though.

192
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:40,679
You're lying to me! I know Holmes is here!

193
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,672
Let me see him!

194
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:46,072
I'm sorry, but Mr. Holmes is out on an investigation.

195
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,172
What kind of investigation?

196
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:50,072
Well, he is...

197
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:53,172
See? You're lying! Save the trouble.

198
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:57,072
Someone will be killed if we don't do something right away!

199
00:11:57,072 --> 00:12:00,699
And nobody can stop it, but Holmes!

200
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,472
Oh no, look at the time.

201
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,272
My sister's match is about to start!

202
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,072
I have to get back!

203
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:10,172
Can I be of some help?

204
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,711
Never mind already, cheapskate!

205
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:17,172
Japanese...

206
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,672
You!

207
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,972
Can you speak Japanese?

208
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:25,172
Yeah, because I lived in Japan before.

209
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,972
If it's okay with you, will you tell me about

210
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,172
the crime you were just talking about?

211
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,072
Why do I have to tell you about it?

212
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:38,372
That's because I'm Holmes' apprentice, Mr. Grass.

213
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:40,372
Why do you know my name?

214
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,741
Do you know me?

215
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,743
It's a simple deduction!

216
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:48,747
The white liquid and powder that is around your mouth...

217
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:51,672
It's the whipped cream and powdered sugar

218
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:53,172
that you put on strawberries, right?

219
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,472
You've got lime, cucumber

220
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,372
and mint in the container that you're holding,

221
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:59,872
so the content is a drink called Pimm's!

222
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,672
Since you're a child, I guess you had them leave out the liquor

223
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:05,172
and had them put only lemonade inside, right?

224
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:07,872
Yeah. I asked the vendor to do that for me.

225
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:13,072
A sport that you would watch holding a Pimm's and strawberries

226
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,172
is the Wimbledon tennis match!

227
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,777
Today is the semi-finals for the women's singles!

228
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:22,572
The first game is from 13:00 and it's after 14:00 now,

229
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:25,872
so your sister's competing in the 2nd match.

230
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,972
One of her opponents is Wang Hai-Li,

231
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,272
who parents are Chinese,

232
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,572
but you don't look Asian at all.

233
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,795
So, then it's her opponent...

234
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:40,272
the one who's kept winning the Wimbledon for 4 consecutive years,

235
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:44,572
the world's number one, Queen Grass...

236
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:47,572
Minerva Grass is your big sister!

237
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:52,172
Besides, through your chest pocket,

238
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:56,815
I can see that you have a badge for the Wimbledon VIP Lounge!

239
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:01,372
Wow! You're really Holmes' disciple!

240
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,472
So, now will you tell me your story?

241
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:05,772
Yep!

242
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:08,272
I was watching the winners of the match practicing

243
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:10,472
in court #15 just after noon, while eating strawberries...

244
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:12,372
A man in back of me suddenly asked me...

245
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,837
So, you like tennis?

246
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,972
Oh, yes! It's quite thrilling!

247
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:25,172
Thrilling you say? Lucky you.

248
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:28,372
Well, you can expect a greater thrill soon.

249
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,872
What?

250
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:34,472
A person is about to be murdered,

251
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:37,172
somewhere in London.

252
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,972
Right before your eyes...

253
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,861
Did you see his face?

254
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,372
Nope.

255
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,172
He was wearing his cap way down to his eyes,

256
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,072
so I couldn't see what he looked like very well.

257
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:50,869
But he gave me this strange piece of paper.

258
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:54,672
Tell Scotland Yard

259
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:57,272
that it's my revelation.

260
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:02,672
If it doesn't make sense, go to Holmes.

261
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:07,372
After he said this, he disappeared off somewhere.

262
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:08,887
This is...

263
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,306
You can read English, can't you?

264
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,606
Yeah.

265
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,006
It looks like a poem of some kind,

266
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,506
but I still can't make out what this means yet.

267
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,406
Hey, there you are!

268
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,406
Don't go running off by yourself.

269
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,606
I've been looking for you!

270
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:32,606
Who is he?

271
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,506
Big sister's ex-coach, Ares!

272
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:39,306
He seems to have been a really strong tennis player before!

273
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,906
Since he used to be big sis's coach,

274
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,921
he gets along with mom too.

275
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,206
He takes care of things around the house for us too now!

276
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,606
Sis is busy going on tours

277
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:52,006
and mom's eyes are bad, so...

278
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:54,206
Come on, Apollo. Let's get back!

279
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:56,106
She's about to play!

280
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:57,306
But...

281
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,937
Go on!

282
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,906
I'll take this to the police.

283
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:02,941
Besides,

284
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:06,406
if he told you to take this mysterious sentence to the police,

285
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:09,206
it means that he's giving time for people to think it out.

286
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:12,706
And the possibility of something happening today is very unlikely!

287
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,706
I guess so.

288
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:17,906
I'll give you my cell phone number then,

289
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:20,306
so make sure you call me if you find out about anything!

290
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:22,961
My name is Apollo Grass!

291
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,963
What's yours?

292
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,965
Conan Edogawa.

293
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,306
Conan?

294
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,706
There couldn't be a more appropriate name for a disciple of Holmes!

295
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,706
See you!

296
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:35,606
Be sure to call me!

297
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:36,975
Okay!

298
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,306
Conan!

299
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:41,806
Who are those people?

300
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:43,906
Is there some sort of trouble?

301
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,806
Don't tell me that you're going to get us

302
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,987
messed up in something despite being abroad?

303
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:51,706
Well, it's sort of something like that.

304
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:56,995
What? You received a mysterious coded message

305
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,406
from a guy who warned of a coming murder?

306
00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:00,706
Are you serious?

307
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:03,906
Yep! According to what the boy Apollo told me!

308
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,306
And, what's written?

309
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:11,906
Uh, the first sentence reads "A rolling bell rises me",

310
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:16,206
so it's "A ringing bell awakes me."

311
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:17,506
The second sentence says,

312
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:21,019
"I am a wizard with a long nose that lives in a castle."

313
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,506
The third sentence says,

314
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:26,306
"I fill myself up with boiled egg as cold as a corpse."

315
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,506
The fourth sentence says,

316
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,029
"All I need is to bite on a whole pickle to finish."

317
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,406
The fifth sentence reads.

318
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:36,106
"That's right, I'll have to order the cursed cake."

319
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:37,506
The sixth line reads,

320
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,037
"the sound of the bell

321
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,506
that rings again stirs up hate in me."

322
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:44,706
And the final seventh line reads...

323
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:47,406
"Finish everything off, stab the white back

324
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:50,006
and pierce through it with two swords."

325
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:53,906
What're those creepy sentences supposed to mean?

326
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,055
It seems that the man who forewarned of a coming murder,

327
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,506
said that this is his revelation.

328
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,106
A revelation, in other words,

329
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:04,606
something like a plan to commit murder.

330
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:06,506
Don't bother...

331
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,406
It's probably some prank of a guy gone nuts or something!

332
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:12,206
But I promised Apollo

333
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:15,606
that I would take this over to Scotland Yard!

334
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,706
"The Wimbledon Center court"

335
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,093
Yes!

336
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:52,606
What? There are many other people

337
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:55,106
who received the same piece of paper?

338
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:58,906
Moreover, you say that it was given only to children?

339
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,606
Scotland Yard is filled with

340
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:05,123
children with the paper and their parents!

341
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:09,127
A dark complexioned guy wearing a cap with dreadlocks

342
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,106
seems to have been passing the paper out at various places

343
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,806
such as the side of the road or parks!

344
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:16,006
While he passed the papers out,

345
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:19,706
he whispered in their ears that someone in London will die.

346
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:21,906
Wait up!

347
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:24,006
Didn't you say that the boy named Apollo

348
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:27,606
was told that somebody would die before his eyes?

349
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:28,706
Hey, hey.

350
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:32,506
If the guy said the same thing to the other kids...

351
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,306
Don't tell me that...

352
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,106
Right.

353
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,906
That someone would be dying

354
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:40,506
in front of the eyes of all those children.

355
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:41,606
In other words,

356
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:46,706
a lot of people may be killed at once, right?

357
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:49,167
A massacre?

358
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,169
Here in London?

359
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:58,006
Which mean that the killings are going to occur

360
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,906
where there is a large crowd of people.

361
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,179
Taking into consideration this time of season,

362
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,206
the Wimbledon tennis game could be a likely target.

363
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,206
Right! Because everyone would be

364
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,506
in front of their TV sets watching the game!

365
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,906
No.

366
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:11,189
Among many of the children who were given that piece of paper,

367
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,906
there were many who were wearing helmets

368
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,206
for the bicycle race too,

369
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:16,206
so I don't think it's the Wimbledon!

370
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:18,006
They said that they were glued to the TV set

371
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:21,199
every day watching the Tour de France.

372
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,806
Tour de... what? What's that?

373
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,506
It's a bicycle race that's held in France!

374
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,806
That race and the Wimbledon

375
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,306
are usually aired back to back

376
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,906
so you can't watch both programs at once.

377
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:38,106
Then, it could be the Great Britain Museum.

378
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:40,306
Or, the Buckingham Palace.

379
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,206
Let's just try going to places

380
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,106
that there may be a large crowd of people!

381
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:46,306
We may find something.

382
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:48,606
I'll try deciphering the code together with Doc!

383
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:51,229
-Hey! -Wait!

384
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,506
We're having dinner with Diana at the hotel tonight, you know!

385
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:56,906
We'll be back by then!

386
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:03,006
We could investigate

387
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:05,243
while trying to solve the code together, can't we?

388
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,606
The best way is to split up

389
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:09,247
and first try to gather as much information as possible!

390
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,706
Because we don't have the slightest idea

391
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,006
where and what the culprit's planning to do at all.

392
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,255
Besides, if we solved the code together,

393
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:20,806
I may have given away that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

394
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,806
I think that you're already showing much of yourself anyway.

395
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,106
First, for the sentence,

396
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:29,606
"I awake with the ringing of the bell."

397
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:34,706
Maybe this is indicating an alarm clock?

398
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:36,006
The next sentence,

399
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:39,277
"I am a wizard with a long nose that lives in a castle",

400
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,279
is talking about a castle somewhere.

401
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:43,006
The key word that has something in common

402
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:46,006
in the 3rd, 4th and 5th sentences is food.

403
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,906
Boiled eggs,

404
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,706
pickles and cake.

405
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:53,706
And the sixth line that reads,

406
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:56,606
"The bell rings again" is probably referring to a clock again

407
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,806
and the final, "two swords",

408
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:02,206
if this refers to the murder weapon being a knife.

409
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,106
If you think of it simply,

410
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,106
something is going to happen in a place

411
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:08,106
where many different types of shops are lined up,

412
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:10,706
near a castle where there are two clock shops,

413
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:14,306
as well as food stores and cake shops,

414
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,506
including shops where knives and weapons are sold.

415
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:18,506
Let's buy a map

416
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:20,606
and check if there is such a place in London!

417
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,806
Okay.

418
00:22:24,606 --> 00:22:27,325
London, the place where Sherlock Holmes,

419
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,806
the one I admire existed.

420
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,906
The mysterious revelation that I received from a boy

421
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,906
named Apollo who I coincidentally ran into.

422
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,906
I'll decipher the code no matter what

423
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,006
and prevent the crime from happening!

424
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,160
"Big Ben"

426
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,740
A great detective, the big bang.

427
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,820
Dad.
