1
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,750
Shoko.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,750
Kira has...

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,650
Resurrected!

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,999
That's ridiculous.

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,950
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,450
Tears are start of all dramas.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,850
The incident takes an unexpected turn.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,150
The mystery deepens, now for the 2nd locked room.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,850
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,950
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,550
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:26,125
We got lost and coincidentally ended up at a strange house.

13
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:29,682
They were about to hold a seance to summon

14
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,682
the spirit of idol Kira Miyahara who had died

15
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:34,782
of an accident a year ago, when we arrived.

16
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:38,137
They explained that rumors concerning Kira's curse

17
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:40,139
was going around among Kira's fan club members.

18
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:42,482
It went as far as a murder being committed,

19
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:46,145
so it prompt them to ascertain the cause of the events.

20
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,147
All of the phenomenon that occurred at the seance

21
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,782
turned out to be a hoax,

22
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:53,682
but there seemed to be something behind Kira's death.

23
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:55,182
Late that night,

24
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:57,782
in the meditation room, where the seance was held,

25
00:02:57,782 --> 00:02:59,282
one of the participants,

26
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:02,182
Ms. Shoko Utakura was found killed.

27
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:11,782
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (2nd Locked room)"

28
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,179
Mr. Honogi?

29
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:23,182
Oh my god! Mr. Hirasaka is...

30
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:25,782
What seems to be the problem?

31
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:28,187
Mr. Hirasaka is dead.

32
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,282
He looks to be dead!

33
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,682
What?

34
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,193
Is that true?

35
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,682
No!

36
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,582
Mr. Hirasaka too?

37
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:42,201
What do you mean, "too"?

38
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,982
Shoko's been killed.

39
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:46,482
In this room.

40
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,207
What?

41
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:51,182
Oh, no.

42
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,882
Where? Please take us there!

43
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:55,382
"I have returned to life, Kira" -I received a strange mail,

44
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:56,982
"I have returned to life, Kira" -so I went to his room

45
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,217
to talk it over with him.

46
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,682
The door was locked, and there was no answer

47
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:01,982
despite my knocking on the door.

48
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:03,482
I was contemplating what I should do

49
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:08,227
when I heard the ringtone of the cell phone from inside the room.

50
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,682
A ringtone?

51
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,231
Since it was the sound of Shoko's cell phone,

52
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,233
I thought that something was strange

53
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,582
and looked in through the ventilation window above the door.

54
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:21,582
You found Mr. Hirasaka dead?

55
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,482
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:32,582
This is not something a child should look at.

57
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,182
Mr. Hirasaka!

58
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:43,982
Mr. Hirasaka...

59
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:48,267
Where's the key to this room?

60
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,882
Only Mr. Hirasaka has it.

61
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,277
Anything to pry open the door?

62
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,279
Oh, there's a tool box in the storage room

63
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,682
at the end of the corridor!

64
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,082
There!

65
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:22,301
Mr. Hirasaka.

66
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,882
What's this?

67
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
This is a poster.

68
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:34,582
Probably the poster of Kira that was in the meditation room!

69
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:36,315
All of this?

70
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,982
Those were the pieces of the posters that have been torn apart,

71
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:41,282
scattered over the floor.

72
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:44,323
Why on earth would anybody do something like this?

73
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:59,782
How's Mr. Hirasaka?

74
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,082
This is. Shoko's?

75
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,382
Probably.

76
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:09,082
And...

77
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:14,682
The rope that was used to kill Shoko?

78
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:20,882
The victim is Ms. Shoko Utakura.

79
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,682
She seems to be gravure model in the making.

80
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,082
Shoko Utakura?

81
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,282
That name sounds familiar.

82
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:32,882
She's the one who first found the corpse of the editor

83
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:35,582
who was murdered about half a month ago.

84
00:06:35,582 --> 00:06:39,082
Oh, that's the case that Inspector Shiratori is handling!

85
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,082
What?

86
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,382
In that incident, the victim

87
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:46,382
seems to left a blood written dying message of the name "Kira".

88
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,387
This text mail was sent to all those concerned

89
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,389
"I have returned to life, Kira" -before the corpse was found.

90
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:52,982
It's Kira on this side too but...

91
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,482
Are you saying that this case has something to do

92
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,382
with the case that Shiratori is in charge of?

93
00:06:57,382 --> 00:07:01,582
Weird things were found here and there of the room.

94
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:05,782
Yeah, those are the seeds of the trick used during the seance.

95
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,182
A seance?

96
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:10,409
The thing where you summon the spirit of the dead?

97
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,682
That's it.

98
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,582
They had a seance here last night.

99
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,882
The spirit they were trying to summon was

100
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:23,182
of idol actress Kira Miyahara who died of an accident a year ago.

101
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,782
Kira Miyahara?

102
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:28,427
I'm not too familiar myself either.

103
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:32,431
But it seems she was a charismatic figure of cosplay sites.

104
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:35,682
Cosplay, meaning dressing up in outfits

105
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,582
like characters in comics or animations.

106
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,882
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:41,082
And before she died it seems like

108
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,682
she was doing gravure modelling and actress work too.

109
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:46,782
She seems to have had quite fervent fans too.

110
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:49,882
And? Why did they hold the seance?

111
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:55,482
It seems that a weird rumor was spreading in her fan club recently.

112
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,682
About a curse or something.

113
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:58,882
A curse?

114
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,182
There were rumors going around that the death

115
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,463
of the editor was also due to Kira's curse,

116
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:07,282
so they decided to hold a seance to summon her spirit

117
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:10,182
and ask her for the truth.

118
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:13,482
And did the spirit appear?

119
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,382
Of course not.

120
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:17,082
It was all a hoax.

121
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:21,282
The ones who set it up were Mr. Hirasaka and Mr. Honogi.

122
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:24,483
I guess they just wanted to surprise everybody.

123
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:28,182
However, the contents of Kira's voice that they set up beforehand,

124
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:31,282
seem to have been switched by someone.

125
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,382
I shall resurrect tonight

126
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:43,482
to avenge my death with my own hands!

127
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,482
It's most probably the doings of the culprit.

128
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,982
The culprit is using Kira's name who died of an accident,

129
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,982
and committing murders repeatedly.

130
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:02,182
There's another thing that struck me as odd.

131
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,982
I didn't detect any defensive wounds on her.

132
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,082
The only trace left on the corpse

133
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:09,482
was a strangulation mark on the throat

134
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,082
made with a thin rope like thing.

135
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:14,533
Could it be that she was drugged to sleep or something

136
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,082
and then strangled?

137
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:24,543
This sure is a strange room, this room.

138
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,545
This is called the meditation room

139
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
where Mr. Hirasaka confines himself to,

140
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,282
when thinking over plans for his comics.

141
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,382
Is it true that this room was locked

142
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:36,555
at the time the corpse was found?

143
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,082
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:41,682
The only entrance to this room is through these doors.

145
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:46,582
The door was locked from the inside with this padlock.

146
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,182
It seems that Mr. Hirasaka

147
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,569
is the only one who has the key to open this lock.

148
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:54,573
The key hasn't been found from inside the room yet.

149
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,282
There's a ventilation window over there,

150
00:09:57,282 --> 00:10:00,579
but there's no footing to climb up there.

151
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,882
If you use the easels and chairs here,

152
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:04,583
maybe it can be done?

153
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,982
Even if you were to stack the easels up on the chair and climb,

154
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,587
the window can't be reached.

155
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,082
If the window were to be reached somehow,

156
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:13,482
evidence of the footing should still be under the window.

157
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,482
But, there was no such thing.

158
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,582
Besides, that window is powered by electricity,

159
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:22,601
so it can be opened and closed only by using this switch.

160
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:28,607
But, if you take your hand off the switch...

161
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,282
It stopped.

162
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,613
The same goes when you close it.

163
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:38,982
You have to keep pushing it or it can't be closed completely.

164
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:43,082
So, you can't escape from that window.

165
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:45,782
Then, how did the culprit get away?

166
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:47,882
Is it Kira's ghost after all?

167
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:51,182
It can't be.

168
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,882
A completely locked room.

169
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,882
So this is it.

170
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:07,482
In the meditation room last night,

171
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:11,482
there were several posters of Kira decorated as props.

172
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:12,982
It seems that the posters were brought in here

173
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,653
and shredded to pieces.

174
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,682
Why would anybody go out of his way to do something like that?

175
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,282
I don't know.

176
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:20,982
How about it, Chiba?

177
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:24,082
We suspect he was poisoned by cyanide compounds.

178
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:27,182
We think it was mixed into his wine.

179
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:30,669
Was this room also locked?

180
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,582
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,182
We were told that Mr. Hirasaka

182
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,382
was the only one who had the key to this room.

183
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:39,082
So, I had no choice but to pry it open.

184
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,982
Did you find the key?

185
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:43,582
It wasn't in the drawer of the desk.

186
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:47,082
The only place left to look is the drawer over there, I guess.

187
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,882
This drawer is locked.

188
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:54,182
Oh, it opened.

189
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,882
I found the key!

190
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,482
This seems to be the key.

191
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:10,482
But it won't move because the shaft

192
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:13,982
was probably bent out of shape when it was pried open.

193
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:15,782
It seems that the key is made in Germany

194
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,717
and cannot easily be duplicated.

195
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:21,382
In order to lock this door,

196
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,182
that key is necessary for both locking it

197
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,082
from outside and inside.

198
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:26,725
Yes, it seems to be so.

199
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:31,082
The other one could be for that padlock.

200
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,682
Confirm it, will you?

201
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,082
Yes, sir!

202
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:36,735
What about the rope that was on the floor?

203
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,882
We can't say for sure until we run a test and confirm a match,

204
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:42,741
but there's a high probability that it's the murder weapon

205
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,182
used to kill Shoko.

206
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:45,682
What about that window?

207
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,082
It was locked from the inside.

208
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:51,782
Either way, there are decorative iron bars on the outside,

209
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:53,682
so going in and out from there isn't possible.

210
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:55,582
So, this was also a locked room.

211
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:56,755
Right.

212
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,182
This ventilation window only opens about 10cm,

213
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,761
making this door the only entrance.

214
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,982
That key was found inside the room in a drawer

215
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:08,767
that was also locked, so...

216
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:12,182
No, inspector, if we look at it from a different angle,

217
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,382
this locked room murder is as good as solved.

218
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:15,782
What?

219
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,382
It's suicide.

220
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,882
Suicide?

221
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,082
Hirasaka is the one who killed Shoko.

222
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,782
Then after he returned to this room,

223
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:28,782
he locked the door and drank poisoned wine.

224
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,182
I see.

225
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:35,482
It could be that Mr. Hirasaka killed Editor Sawanami too.

226
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,182
But, "Kira" was left written at the scene of the crime, right?

227
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:41,782
Mr. Hirasaka is the one who wrote that too.

228
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,582
He was also was the one who sent the text mail out

229
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:45,982
from Shoko's cell phone.

230
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,382
He probably wanted to make it appear

231
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:52,811
as if the main character of his comics appeared in reality

232
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,382
and committed serial killings.

233
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,582
If so, this room wouldn't have to be locked, would it?

234
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:59,882
Because it would easily give away the fact that he committed suicide.

235
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,382
His comics, The Blackmagic Girl, was it?

236
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:06,282
The main character Kira is a witch.

237
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,827
That's why he probably wanted to make it look like an impossible crime,

238
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,082
in which a magic spell was used!

239
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:15,982
It does sort of seem to make sense.

240
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:20,082
I hope you solved the other locked room mystery too.

241
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,882
Well, not quite yet.

242
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,582
Is that so?

243
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:26,182
However, the only one who had the key to the meditation room

244
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,982
was Hirasaka.

245
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,849
I saw him lock the door from the outside with a padlock

246
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,851
after the seance.

247
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:36,582
No one besides Hirasaka could've gone into that room.

248
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,282
Even if he were to have committed suicide,

249
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,861
would he go out of his way to put the key away in a drawer,

250
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,382
and lock that drawer as well?

251
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:47,982
And besides,

252
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:53,882
why did he have to tear up Kira's posters like this?

253
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:06,885
Everyone, I hate to do this

254
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,446
knowing that you're all tired,

255
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,146
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

256
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:16,446
Last night, the body of Ms. Shoko Itakura was found at 01:00.

257
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:20,246
After that, Mr. Hirasaka's body was also found.

258
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,346
The estimated time of death for both people

259
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:25,546
was between 23:00 to 01:00.

260
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,646
Therefore, I would like you to tell me

261
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,546
what each of you were doing during this time.

262
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,911
Last night, after the seance,

263
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:36,046
there was a strange atmosphere going around so...

264
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:39,946
We all went back to our rooms without wasting any time.

265
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:42,046
It was around 22:00.

266
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:43,946
After returning to my room,

267
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:47,746
I was looking forward to Kira resurrecting right through

268
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,446
without sleeping a wink.

269
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:53,446
Maho, Mr. Mifune and I,

270
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:57,246
talked to Mr. Mouri for a while,

271
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,937
so I guess we left for our rooms at around 23:00.

272
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,946
Back then, you called Shoko, didn't you?

273
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:04,943
Oh. Do you know what time it was?

274
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:06,546
Yes.

275
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:10,949
At 22:40.

276
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,046
Back then, she said that she had a headache.

277
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:17,446
After that you went to check on her, didn't you, Maho?

278
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:19,446
Yes.

279
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,961
I was worried so I went to look in on her,

280
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,446
but Shoko wasn't in her room.

281
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:28,967
My room is right next to hers, so I waited for her to return

282
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,969
hoping to give her some medicine,

283
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:36,975
but she didn't return so I got worried,

284
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,446
and went to Mr. Mouri for help.

285
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:44,146
Is there anyone who met Mr. Hirasaka after the seance?

286
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:50,989
Oh, before I returned to my room,

287
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,746
I talked to him for a little while in his room.

288
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,546
What did you talk about?

289
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:59,746
About somebody having switched Kira's voice

290
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:03,001
that we set up beforehand the seance.

291
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:06,446
But, I returned to my room in about 15 minutes.

292
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:11,946
Why did you decide to have a seance?

293
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:13,646
Why...

294
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:16,446
Because there were strange rumors going around

295
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:18,746
in the fan club about Kira casting a curse.

296
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,019
And even murder was committed so...

297
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,846
Do you seriously believe in spirits and curses?

298
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:25,646
Oh, not really.

299
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,966
It's true that it's not something that a sensible adult would do.

300
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,031
Didn't you have some other purpose for carrying it out?

301
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,180
Well...

302
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,780
Come to think of it, Mr. Honogi,

303
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,039
you mentioned receiving strange calls in the past, didn't you?

304
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,041
Well...

305
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,043
What're you talking about, Yatsukawa?

306
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:49,047
Well, I think it was a month ago,

307
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,780
we coincidentally ran into each other at a snack bar

308
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,580
and drank together.

309
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,880
Yes. Hello.

310
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,080
What happened?

311
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,280
I've been getting upsetting phone calls recently.

312
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,480
I wonder who on earth it is.

313
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,880
Weren't you being blackmailed by somebody?

314
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,180
No, that's not true.

315
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,780
Come to think of it,

316
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,079
Mr. Sawanami also received strange letters.

317
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,480
Really?

318
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,083
Yes, when I went to the publisher

319
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,580
to make arrangements for a magazine about a month ago...

320
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,080
Mr. Sawanami, do you know about the rumor that's going around?

321
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,580
Rumor?

322
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,480
It seems that the members of the fan club

323
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,680
who have switched to become fans of other idols

324
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,680
have been getting hurt or falling ill.

325
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,101
What?

326
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:48,180
Some people seem to claim seeing Kira after they got hurt.

327
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,880
Ridiculous.

328
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,580
Are you saying that Kira's ghost

329
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,113
is haunting the fans who have become fans of other idols?

330
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,180
Gosh. Not again.

331
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,580
Is that Kira?

332
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,480
It's nothing.

333
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
It's just a prank.

334
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,280
He said, "Not again"?

335
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,880
Yes.

336
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,680
Mr. Sawanami was being blackmailed by somebody

337
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,135
and killed.

338
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,080
Mr. Honogi, how about you?

339
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,580
I...

340
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,143
Please tell us the truth.

341
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,780
It's true that I was being blackmailed.

342
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,880
What kind of blackmail?

343
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,780
Kira didn't die of an accident

344
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,780
but rather, here, during the party.

345
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:45,163
And Mr. Hirasaka has hidden Kira's body.

346
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:49,167
There was a similar rumor spreading through the internet too.

347
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Someone probably took it for fact, and committed the murders.

348
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,180
Mr. Sawanami and Mr. Hirasaka were also being blackmailed.

349
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,780
But, it was just nonsense, a baseless rumor!

350
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,780
And yet, Mr. Sawanami ended up the way he did!

351
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,880
I wonder if the blackmailer is the culprit?

352
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,980
Could it be that everyone was gathered here

353
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,980
to search for the blackmailer?

354
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,880
Under the pretense of holding a seance.

355
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,680
Is that right?

356
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,280
That's right, after discussing it with Mr. Hirasaka.

357
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,180
Kira's fervent fan, Mr. Kani.

358
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Shoko and Maho who worshipped Kira as a charismatic figure.

359
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,480
Mr. Yatsukawa, assistant director from the TV station

360
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,880
are also to be suspected.

361
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,217
Mr. Mifune too.

362
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,680
Is that why you called us over here?

363
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,221
No joke.

364
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,380
Mr. Hirasaka suggested that

365
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,580
we scare everyone at the seance and watch their reaction.

366
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,380
If Kira's voice that you set up beforehand

367
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,980
was switched by someone,

368
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,241
it could be that the blackmailer is among someone here after all.

369
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,243
So, it's highly likely that the person who killed Mr. Sawanami

370
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,880
and the culprit of this case is one and the same.

371
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,780
It could be that Kira's family or lover

372
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,980
believed the rumors on the internet and...

373
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,253
Kira had no family.

374
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,880
They seemed to have died in a car accident when she was a child.

375
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,180
Oh, that's why Kira was more into safe driving than anyone else.

376
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,780
It seems so.

377
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,280
Pops, why don't you have them show you

378
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,780
the word "Kira" that Mr. Sawanami left behind?

379
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,580
Maybe it'll help you come up with something.

380
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,680
Well, true.

381
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,980
Inspector.

382
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,280
Why not?

383
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,279
-Takagi. -Yes, sir.

384
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,285
Inspector.

385
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,480
This key was the key for the padlock in question after all.

386
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,680
I see.

387
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,580
And, as for the rope that was found in Mr. Hirasaka's room,

388
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,880
there's no doubt that it was used to kill Ms. Utakura.

389
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
Just as I thought.

390
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,680
If so, just as I deduced, Hirasaka's the...

391
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,380
But, unless we solve the other locked room mystery...

392
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,880
Maybe there's a secret escape route

393
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,580
in the meditation room or something?

394
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
There could never be such a thing.

395
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,980
Mr. Mouri, I'm had the picture of the word

396
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,480
sent over by mail right now.

397
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,880
"Kira"

398
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,180
This is...

399
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,080
Don't tell me the culprit is that person.

400
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,339
"Kira"

401
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,423
"Ninja Technique"

403
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,196
Ninja technique, "sober up"!

404
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,500
Karate breathing method, "Seiya"!
