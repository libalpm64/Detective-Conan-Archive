1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,940
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,040
This case may lead us to those in black.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,140
They may be involved in this case.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,460
Excuse me, Detective Mouri!

9
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,860
I'd like to ask you about the recent homicide case.

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,360
It is said that Mr. Nagumo who was arrested

11
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
confessed that he committed the murder

12
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,460
because Nobuharu was being bullied by Mr. Kazami.

13
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,860
If that's what he's saying, so it is.

14
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,560
All I did was expose the trick that he used

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,660
and advised him that it would be wiser to turn himself in

16
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,460
before any evidence came up.

17
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,860
If you will excuse me, then...

18
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,260
Mr. Mouri...

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,860
-Please wait! -Just another word, please.

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,760
A man says few but the message is still there.

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm so cool!

22
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,560
Ghads, when he rarely solves the case without goofing,

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,360
he gets all carried away.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,260
Well, I guess I can't help making Pops play detective

25
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,960
because I got to get information on the men in black.

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,060
But, they sure don't show up.

27
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,460
Rewind, rewind.

28
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,460
They collect large sums of cash by repeating assassinations.

29
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,160
They force people like Ai to make drugs,

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,360
and go around gathering competent computer programmers.

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,460
Just what... what are they after?

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,060
Hello, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

33
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't tell me that they're planning

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
to create an incredible game using all that cash.

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,460
What? A game?

36
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,460
The whereabouts of a system engineer who makes games is unknown.

37
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,960
Yes.

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,460
And you'd like us to find him for you.

39
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,460
Hey, tell him I'm not in.

40
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
I have to record the re-run of Yoko's drama

41
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,060
cutting all the commercials, you see.

42
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,360
Yes, now it'll be just fine!

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,060
My dad's got a lot of free time today.

44
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,460
Hey.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,060
Come on, hurry shave and fix your necktie.

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,760
Yes.

47
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,660
The whereabouts of a game system engineer is unknown?

48
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,760
Don't tell me that...

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,160
Could it be...

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,460
"The Remains of Voiceless Testimony (Part 1)"

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,460
So he's the system engineer that disappeared about a week ago.

52
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,560
And you say this is not the first time he disappeared like this.

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,860
What do you mean?

54
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,560
Well, each time the deadline for the game system

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,260
that he is ordered to do closes in,

56
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,460
he frequently disappears.

57
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,260
Well, we thought it's the usual this time, too.

58
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,060
But we can't afford to just wait with our fingers in our mouths either.

59
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,560
We asked the police to ask him previously

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,260
and he really bawled us out,

61
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,460
so this time we decided to ask you instead.

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,060
I see.

63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,760
They don't seem to have anything to do with the guys I'm looking for.

64
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,360
So, if you do find him, please contact me...

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,660
Hey, you must be kidding!

66
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,160
My place is dishing out the most cash!

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
Hey! Our company's the one

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,160
that first ordered the system to him this time!

69
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,860
You're not of the same company?

70
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,660
"Katsumichi Sugai (39)" -I'm Sugai, the one who ordered him

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,860
to make the system for the Igo software this time.

72
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
"Jouhei Naito (47)" -I'm Naito,

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,860
and asked him to make a chess software.

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,660
"Ryusuke Soma (44)" -I asked him to make a shogi software.

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,360
My name's Soma.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
But, is it possible for one person

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
to handle making three different kinds of game software at once?

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,760
That's why we want to find him and complain!

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,660
That things are not how we thought they were!

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,360
We all went to place our order to him separately,

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,060
and this is what he told each of us,

82
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
"I haven't signed a contract with anyone this time

83
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,660
so leave it to me".

84
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,160
When did you find out that he was taking work

85
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,060
from all of you at the same time?

86
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,260
A week ago, we all received this e-mail from him.

87
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,060
Taking on three jobs at the same time sure is tiring.

88
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,660
Well, since my heart seems to be doing pretty good recently,

89
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,360
I think I'll leave my office for a while

90
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,560
and take my time working on my orders.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,660
-This man... -So, please be patient until I'm finished.

92
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,860
I didn't notice because he was wearing glasses in the picture,

93
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,360
but isn't he Mr. Taku Itakura, who is famous for computer graphics?

94
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,660
Yes, he wears contacts when he appears in public.

95
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,960
Do you know him?

96
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,460
Yes, he comes out a lot in the credit of the movies.

97
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,860
Ever since his eyesight got bad about 3 years ago,

98
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,760
he left the field of computer graphics

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,660
and now concentrates on developing systems.

100
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,860
If he's that famous, he could've been kidnapped.

101
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,260
No way.

102
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,860
Rather with that guy, anything is possible.

103
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,960
About 2 years ago,

104
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,560
I saw a guy with a mustache at Mr. Itakura's office.

105
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,560
He was a big man with a Kansai accent.

106
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm sure you've seen him, too.

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
He was at the Mantendo game convention.

108
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,860
Tequila!

109
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,560
What did the big man say?

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,060
What were they talking about at the office?

111
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't know.

112
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,460
When I got there, he was saying, "We don't need you no more",

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,360
and he was ready to leave.

114
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,960
Is that all? Isn't there more?

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,460
Hey, Conan. Just what's the matter with you?

116
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,760
Darn.

117
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,860
I've no choice but to find Mr. Itakura and ask him myself.

118
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,660
If I'm not mistaken,

119
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,060
that big man supposedly died in the explosion back then,

120
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,460
so I don't think he's involved.

121
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,360
The problem is this picture.

122
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,760
How shall we start searching for him?

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,860
I think he's in a hotel or something somewhere.

124
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Hotel's refuse to give out private information of their guests, too.

125
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,360
Besides, he's probably using a pseudonym anyway.

126
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
Ran.

127
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,960
I want to eat sashimi, Tientsin food and beef stew tonight.

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,260
Hey, wait second. That's Japanese, Chinese and Western-style food.

129
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,560
You can't even get that combination of food

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
at a family restaurant that's got almost all kinds of food.

131
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,660
Which means if one customer orders all three kinds of food by himself,

132
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,460
people will think he's a weird customer, right?

133
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,060
A weird customer?

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,060
Come to think of it, he has a shogi board,

135
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,660
an Igo board and a chessboard in his room.

136
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,360
Have you heard what he took with him from his workplace?

137
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,160
I heard that he packed the notebook type computer

138
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,060
that he always uses, and a few discs in his bag and left.

139
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,160
He didn't take anything else with him, then?

140
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Yes.

141
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,960
What is with this hotel?

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Who may I ask are you?

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,460
I'm the one who borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo game from you.

144
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,460
The phone in my room is suddenly not working.

145
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,560
I'm calling from my cell phone now,

146
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,060
hurry and do something about it!

147
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,860
We do not rent out things like that in our hotel.

148
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,560
Oh, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

149
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,060
Okay, next it's Hotel New Baker.

150
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,360
If a guest borrows shogi, chess, and Igo board all by himself

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,660
and stays at the hotel for a week,

152
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,360
I'm sure the employees of the hotel are talking about him.

153
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,760
I'm calling on my cell phone right now,

154
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
but hurry and do something, will you?

155
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,260
You're Mr. Itakura of room 2004, aren't you?

156
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,660
Right, room 2004.

157
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,160
I'll send somebody over to your room right away, sir.

158
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,260
The telephone cord seems to have unhooked!

159
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm so sorry.

160
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,760
Hotel New Baker, room 2004!

161
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Ghads, why are you guys coming with me?

162
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,660
You're nothing but trouble!

163
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,560
Because Conan said...

164
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,060
It's not fair, Pops.

165
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,060
I know you're planning to eat at the luxurious hotel restaurant.

166
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,460
No big deal, Mr. Detective.

167
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,260
If Mr. Itakura is found, we'll treat you to a meal.

168
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
Oh, well.

169
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,160
So this is his hide-out.

170
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,660
You're all competitors in the business, aren't you?

171
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,960
Why'd you all end up coming here together?

172
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,460
Because we found out that he took jobs from all three of us at once.

173
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,660
All of us who are in charge of the job we ordered to him

174
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,060
decided that we three should talk to him together.

175
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,960
And so, it dawned on me to ask you to help us, Mr. Mouri.

176
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,760
I was the one, who suggested that we ask a detective to help us!

177
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
No, I'm the one who mentioned his name.

178
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,360
Idiot! I'm the one who contacted him by phone.

179
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,160
I'm the one who first mentioned the idea, right?

180
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,560
Gosh.

181
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,160
Man, Yoko's program is over.

182
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,660
Oh, my. Wearing a cheap wristwatch like that,

183
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm sure you'll get some snide remarks about it.

184
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760
Mr. Itakura is really picky when it comes to watches.

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,860
-Look, that's why... -We also...

186
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,460
Is your wristwatch genuine or what?

187
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,260
You jerk! I just bought it 5 days ago, it's brand new.

188
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,160
I'll bet yours is fake.

189
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,260
I'm sorry. Mr. Naito, can you push the 20th floor for me, please?

190
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,460
Sure.

191
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,060
Let's see.

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,260
I'm sure that Mr. Itakura will be surprised seeing us all here.

193
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,360
Yes.

194
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,260
I wonder if it's okay to head for the hotel room just like that?

195
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,160
Mr. Itakura is a man who is somehow

196
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,660
involved with Tequila, a member of the organization.

197
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,060
I wonder if it's safe for Ran, Pops and those people

198
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,960
to go to his room?

199
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,160
Those last words that Tequila said to Mr. Itakura,

200
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,060
"You're of no use to us anymore".

201
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,060
In other words,

202
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,460
it could mean, "We're finished with you, so we're going to kill you".

203
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
What if those guys are hiding near here

204
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,260
to get rid of Mr. Itakura.

205
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Rather, they may already be in his room.

206
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,260
Come on, idiot. What am I getting all panicky for?

207
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,860
Cool head.

208
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,760
Tequila said so 2 years ago.

209
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,460
If they really meant to kill him,

210
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,260
Mr. Itakura would've been killed long ago.

211
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,060
Besides, if Mr. Itakura is a member of the organization,

212
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,660
he would never let an outsider such as Mr. Soma, enter the room

213
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,160
while he is talking to Tequila.

214
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
At any rate, we've got to meet Mr. Itakura

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,860
and get him to somehow tell us what's going on.

216
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,660
I've got to find out why Tequila came to his office.

217
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,460
Strange.

218
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,560
He's got this "Don't Disturb" sign hanging on the door and yet...

219
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,060
He probably went out to eat or something.

220
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,860
Let's wait in front of here, then.

221
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,060
Thank you so much for the trouble.

222
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,160
It's an automatic lock door,

223
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,560
so please make sure you take your key along with you.

224
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,060
Yes, I will.

225
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,160
Excuse me, mister!

226
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,060
Could you open my uncle's room, too?

227
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,660
It seems he forgot that we were coming and went out.

228
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,860
But...

229
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Hurry! Or I'm going to leak.

230
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,760
I gotta go...

231
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm really sorry, thank you.

232
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
You're pretty sharp, sonny.

233
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,660
Because if Mr. Itakura comes back

234
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,560
and sees us all in front of the door of his room,

235
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,760
he might run away, right?

236
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
But that's no need for that, sonny.

237
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,660
It seems that Mr. Itakura has just dozed off.

238
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,160
Of all things I tell you...

239
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,560
Hey, get up. Hey.

240
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,160
You can't get away, Mr. Itakura.

241
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,760
What?

242
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,880
Mr. Itakura!

243
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,780
Mr. Itakura?

244
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,480
No good.

245
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,380
He's been dead for more than a day.

246
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,680
What? It can't be...

247
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,580
I'll go call the police.

248
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,780
What happened?

249
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,580
Probably a heart attack.

250
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,380
Pills are scattered all over the desk.

251
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,580
He probably had a sudden heart attack

252
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,380
and tried to drink medicine,

253
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,880
but couldn't, and died.

254
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,080
I tell you. It's because he goes into hiding.

255
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,780
No, Mr. Itakura didn't die of an illness.

256
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,880
He was killed by someone.

257
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,680
But, why?

258
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,780
Why did all clues of those guys vanish just like that?

259
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,580
Darn!

260
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,580
What's that?

261
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,880
A diary?

262
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,680
Mr. Itakura's diary.

263
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,880
If so, maybe there's something in it.

264
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,180
About what Tequila came to visit Mr. Itakura for...

265
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,480
and what the men in black are trying to do.

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,680
Maybe looking through this

267
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,180
will give us an idea.

268
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,180
Hey!

269
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,480
Don't you dare touch the belongings of a dead person!

270
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,380
Seriously. The minute I take my eyes off of you...

271
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,880
Darn. I can't do a thing about it after all.

272
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,280
I guess I'll have to let him know what's going on

273
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,880
to look inside the diary.

274
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
About the fact that Mr. Itakura

275
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,380
didn't die a natural death by a heart attack,

276
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,480
but was made to look that way by someone.

277
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,580
And that the possibility of that someone being one of the three here is,

278
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,180
is very likely.

279
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,980
The victim is Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45,

280
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,680
a system engineer of games.

281
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,580
And, the cause of his death is?

282
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,680
I can't say anything decisive

283
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,880
but there are no visible external injuries.

284
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,480
Judging from the fact

285
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,780
that he was taking doses of a coronary enlargement drug,

286
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,780
it is likely that he had a heart attack.

287
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,780
He's probably been dead for about 2 days.

288
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,380
Inspector! We got a hold of Mr. Itakura's doctor.

289
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,580
And?

290
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,880
Mr. Itakura's heart seems to have been in very bad shape,

291
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,780
and he was scheduled to undergo surgery

292
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,780
as soon as he completed the work he had taken on this time.

293
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,280
Which means,

294
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,180
this case is not one that's to be handled by you.

295
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,880
Yes, it sure looks to be that way.

296
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,780
But, if he's been dead for two days,

297
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,580
why didn't any of the hotel personnel realize it?

298
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,080
He used to hate people coming into his working place.

299
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Yes, that's right. Just the other day,

300
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,380
he was fuming about the fact that the papers on his desk

301
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,180
had been moved 10 centimeters.

302
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,880
And, he rarely changes the sheets he uses at home either,

303
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,780
so I'm sure he refused to have his bed made.

304
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,180
Who are those three people?

305
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,780
They are employees of the companies that placed jobs to Mr. Itakura.

306
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,780
They came to ask me

307
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,380
to search for Mr. Itakura who disappeared a week ago.

308
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,680
And, you found him all right, but he was dead?

309
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,280
Yes.

310
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,380
But it's no wonder that he ended up this way,

311
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,580
being that he confined himself in a hotel, neglecting his health.

312
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,280
I see.

313
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,080
I think this man favors tidiness.

314
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Because when we came into this room,

315
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,780
this man was sitting on the chair with his face pushed down on the desk,

316
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,080
and yet there are no marks left on the desk.

317
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,080
Marks?

318
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,180
The marks of his saliva.

319
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,380
If somebody drools as much as he does,

320
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
it would usually dirty the desk too, wouldn't it?

321
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm sure the man wiped it.

322
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,980
Idiot!

323
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,380
Why would a man who is suffering from a heart attack

324
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,080
wipe the desk before drinking his medicine?

325
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Then, who wiped the desk?

326
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,380
I wonder who can it be?

327
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,880
Besides, this is the first time that I heard that the victim

328
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,580
was found with his face down on the desk.

329
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,080
Oh, well. He slid to the floor when we shook him...

330
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,380
If so, then it's strange.

331
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,580
The back of the victim's hand.

332
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,980
If the hand of the victim whose face was down on the desk

333
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,780
was found stiff in this position, his hand would've had to be

334
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,980
stuck between the desk and his body all this time.

335
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,080
But there are no such traces left.

336
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,880
Don't tell me that Mr. Itakura died somewhere else?

337
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,980
But the hands and feet of the corpse

338
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,180
is completely stiff in this manner, inspector.

339
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,380
If so, it would be impossible

340
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,380
unless someone tied Mr. Itakura onto the chair deliberately.

341
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,280
I see.

342
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,280
So Mr. Itakura was probably made to sit in the chair,

343
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,180
tied up with his hands on his chest,

344
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,280
and was unable to take his medicine unless somebody helped him drink it.

345
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,580
Then, don't tell me that this is...

346
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

347
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,580
A homicide.

348
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Oh, no.

349
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,480
But if so, there should be marks of him having been tied up.

350
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
How about it, coroner?

351
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,780
There are no such clear traces,

352
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,480
but it seems that exterior pressure

353
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
had been applied to a wide area over his body,

354
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
from the many visible traces of blood congestion.

355
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,880
Just what does that mean?

356
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,580
This blanket is soft and warm!

357
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,280
Conan! Stop that.

358
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,780
But, what's this?

359
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,080
It's got sticky stuff on here and there!

360
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,680
I get it. It's the blanket.

361
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,080
The blanket?

362
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,380
The killer probably wrapped Mr. Itakura's body with the blanket,

363
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,180
made him sit in the chair and then wrapped his body up with masking tape.

364
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,280
A pillow or something was probably placed in between his lap and chest,

365
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,580
to make him lean against the desk.

366
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,280
I see. If so, there would be no traces.

367
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,880
Which means that the legs of this table that are fixed in place

368
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,980
is what held his chair in place.

369
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,080
Although it looks as if they removed it once,

370
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,680
a little of the adhesive of the masking tape can still be detected.

371
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,280
In other words, the killer left Mr. Itakura in that position

372
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,880
until he died of a heart attack.

373
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,680
Then after postmortem rigidity spread throughout his body,

374
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,580
they came back again to remove the masking tape and blanket.

375
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,780
That is, they made it look like he died of an illness.

376
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Okay.

377
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,280
Ask the hotel employees if they saw any suspicious-looking people

378
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
during the last three days.

379
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,580
Yes, sir!

380
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,780
A hotel...

381
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,580
Well, the thing is, I called this hotel making believe

382
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,580
that I was Mr. Itakura to hunt down this room.

383
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,880
I told them that I was the one who borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo games.

384
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,180
And complained to them saying that my telephone broke down,

385
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,980
so to hurry and do something about it.

386
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,680
And that's how I got the room number to this room.

387
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,880
I heard them laughing on the other side of the line after that.

388
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Saying, "Not again".

389
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,180
What?

390
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,480
Which means that somebody else could've done the same thing

391
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,580
to find out where he was, too?

392
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,780
Well, but I wonder if there would be anyone

393
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,380
who have the same sort of brains that I, Kogoro Mouri has.

394
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,180
Inspector! We found another suspicious person

395
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,780
who pretended to be Mr. Itakura saying that

396
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,080
the phone of his room broke down.

397
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,780
Oh, so there was someone else.

398
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,480
When the employee went to check the room later,

399
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Mr. Itakura yelled at him

400
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,380
and chased him away saying, "I didn't call you".

401
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,680
I guess it would be safe to say

402
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,580
that the killer is the one who made the phone call.

403
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,180
But how did you know

404
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,180
that Mr. Itakura borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo game from the hotel?

405
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
From his mail.

406
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,080
I saw the mail with the image attachment

407
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,380
that Mr. Itakura sent to the three of them.

408
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,280
That is, Mr. Itakura sitting in front of a shogi, chess and Igo board.

409
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,680
I see.

410
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,280
In other words,

411
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,780
all three of you could've used the same method

412
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,080
that Mr. Mouri used to come here.

413
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,780
What?

414
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,480
Are you serious?

415
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,980
No way.

416
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,580
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,120
"Foundation Stone"
