1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,120
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,920
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,020
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,720
Today is a special of a cursed mask.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,920
A mysterious room and an eerie smile.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,520
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,520
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
His name is Detective Conan.

9
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,050
Dad, be careful driving, will you?

10
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,350
She's right.

11
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,450
Remember? You're going to be performing on a charity show held for children

12
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,550
who have lost their families In traffic accidents next week, Pops.

13
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,050
If you get into an accident in a place like this,

14
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,550
we couldn't face up to Ms. Beniko Suou,

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,150
the hostess of the show who chose you as a guest.

16
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,050
I know.

17
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,650
Ms. Suou invited us to a party today, too.

18
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,250
If I get into an accident, I'll miss out on all the good food.

19
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,250
That person called Suou used to be a famous singer, right?

20
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,650
Yes, she used to be a big star,

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,150
once called "Canary of the Orient".

22
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,450
But nowadays, she is busy taking care of a show biz promotion

23
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,950
called "Kurenai Promotion". As its president,

24
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,150
that she rarely stands on stage anymore.

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,050
Of all things...

26
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,450
Talk about danger.

27
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,550
Why is this tree in the middle of the road like this?

28
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,650
There's something posted on it.

29
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,350
What's this?

30
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,450
"Don't participate in the charity party held by Beniko Suou.

31
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,150
You'll regret it.

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,650
Messenger of the cursed mask."

33
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,950
What's that supposed to mean?

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,450
Messenger of the cursed mask?

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,550
"The Cursed Mask Smile Callously"

36
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,750
What a mansion.

37
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,250
This is some mansion.

38
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,450
That guy...

39
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,650
He's the photographer, Masanori Katagiri.

40
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,950
What? You mean the one who travels around the world

41
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,650
taking pictures of beautiful landscapes?

42
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,650
"Masanori Katagiri (45), Photographer"

"Profesional Baseball Player" -baseball player, Mamoru Matsudaira.

45
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,650
Oh, and you're the renowned detective yourself.

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,250
-You are Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right? -Yes, I am.

47
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,550
Are you guests at the charity show to be held next week, too?

48
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,750
Yes.

49
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,050
What a beauty!

50
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,950
She is Haruka Nagara.

51
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,450
You mean the tarot fortuneteller

52
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,950
that is super popular on TV and in the magazines?

53
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,050
Looks like you know her, too.

54
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,650
Every time I stand on the batter's base,

55
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,750
I wear the color of gloves that matches the lucky color of today

56
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,250
that she announces.

57
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,350
And is that how you became the king of home runs?

58
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,850
This is...

59
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,350
What seems to be the matter?

60
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,250
"Nagara Haruka (25)" -I feel something ominous...

"Tarot Card Reader" -about this mansion.

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,650
I feel that there is going to be large disaster.

63
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,150
What an eerie thing to say.

64
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,950
Well, rather than talk out here,

65
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,850
shouldn't we ask to be let in?

66
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,650
Why yes!

67
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,050
But, which door do we take

68
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,150
to get into the mansion?

69
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,950
There are two entrances.

70
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,150
Thank you all for coming.

71
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,950
Oh, so that side is the entrance.

72
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,650
Thank you all for coming.

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,250
What is happening here?

74
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,350
"Shimogasa Honami (21), Suou House Maid" -Will Mr. Mouri and his party

75
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,450
enter from this side which is the east entrance.

76
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,450
Huh?

77
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,950
Only us?

78
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,150
"Shimogasa Minaho (21)" -Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira and Ms. Nagara...

79
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,950
"Suou House Maid" -come in from here, the west entrance.

80
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,750
Why are we going in separately?

81
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,550
The inside of this mansion is divided to the east and west.

82
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,350
Those who will be spending the night in the rooms on the west side

83
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,350
enter from the west entrance.

84
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,350
And those who will spend the night in the rooms on the east side

85
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,150
will enter from the east entrance.

86
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,650
It is a tradition practiced here.

87
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,750
What a strange place.

88
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,650
If we don't stick to traditional practices in this mansion...

89
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,250
Disaster befalls us.

90
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,950
Disaster befalls?

91
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,050
What makes you say that?

92
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,050
Well, because this is the place where...

93
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,050
Because this is the place where...

94
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,050
The cursed mask resides.

95
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,350
Cursed mask?

96
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,250
It's a mask.

97
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,550
There's one on this side, too.

98
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,950
Mrs. Suou likes to collect masks.

99
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,750
This way, please.

100
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,550
Next, it's the mask of a cat.

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,550
Your baggage has already been brought here,

102
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,850
so please wait in the room of masks.

103
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,250
The room of masks?

104
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,350
This room here.

105
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,450
Mr. Mouri?

106
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,850
So this room connects the east and west wing of the mansion.

107
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,750
This is fantastic!

108
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,650
There are so many masks.

109
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,750
Look at all this.

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,650
What is this?

111
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,550
A remote control?

112
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,850
What's happening?

113
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,950
What on earth is this?

114
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,550
What's with all these masks?

115
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,350
What is all this?

116
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,050
What are all these masks?

117
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,050
These are called the masks of Chableu.

118
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,550
You are...

119
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,250
"Beniko Suou (63), Singer" -Beniko Suou?

120
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,450
Thank you so much everyone for coming.

121
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,250
"Kazuyo Inaba (40), Suou's Secretary"

122
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,550
How do you like my precious collection?

123
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,850
Yes. Well, I guess you could say so.

124
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,850
You just mentioned the masks of Chableu,

125
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,950
but are you refering to the masks covering the sides wall?

126
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,550
Yes, it is said that the Spanish sculptor,

127
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,050
Chableu Gonzales made it just before he died.

128
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,450
It was the 200th mask that he made.

129
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,650
It is also called "The cursed mask".

130
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,350
Cursed mask?

131
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,750
What is this cursed mask all about?

132
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,250
Chableu Gonzales is a sculptor of tragedy.

133
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,250
Although overflowing with talent,

134
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,050
trapped by the jealousy of his brother,

135
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,850
his fame, glory and estate were all taken away from him.

136
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,850
Chableu who became very wary of people,

137
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,750
began making masks as if obsessed by something.

138
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,350
After finishing his 200th mask, he killed himself.

139
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,650
The masks that were scattered around his body

140
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,050
were splattered with blood.

141
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,250
And the masks looked to have sucked the blood themselves.

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,250
Since then, Chableu's reputation was restored,

143
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,450
and his masks were handed down to various people.

144
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,450
However, many who owned the masks seemed to die tragic deaths.

145
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,450
An English head of the bank fell off his horse

146
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,650
the following day after getting hold of one of the masks, and died.

147
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,050
A French jeweler was attacked by robbers and killed.

148
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,250
And with the passing of time, this mask was called,

149
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,650
"The cursed mask" that sips the blood of its owner,

150
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,250
and was feared by people.

151
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,150
Are you all right, owning all 200 of such masks?

152
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,750
No need to worry.

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,350
I had a great clairvoyant seal the curse in.

154
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,850
It's starting to get more and more occult around here.

155
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,750
But, Ms. Suou,

156
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,750
the evil will of a living person

157
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,650
may be even more frightening than a curse.

158
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,650
Oh, what do you mean?

159
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,350
Well, on our way here,

160
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,750
out path was blocked by a fallen tree,

161
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,750
and we found this pinned to the tree.

162
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,950
Oh, my.

163
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,050
Mr. Mouri, I received a similar sort of letter three days ago.

164
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,350
I got one, too.

165
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,650
Same here.

166
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,450
What?

167
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,850
It seems to be more than just a prank.

168
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,350
A similar thing was sent to the agency as well.

169
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,750
Touya, you're late.

170
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,250
"Touya Aikawa (26)" -I'm right in the midst of a nationwide tour.

171
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,750
"Rock Singer" -Give me a break for being tardy.

172
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,350
-Who is he? -Conan, don't you know him?

173
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,650
He's the most popular rock singer these days, Touya Aikawa.

174
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,650
You received a strange letter?

175
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,550
The name of the sender is not written.

176
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,750
The lettering of the name of the addressee is also odd.

177
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,550
It seems a ruler was used so that the handwriting cannot be identified.

178
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,450
May I open it?

179
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,950
Yes, please do.

180
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,750
This is...

181
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,450
"The cursed mask will sip blood tonight.

182
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,850
From the messenger of the cursed mask."

183
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,150
Ms. Suou, you'd better call the police.

184
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,950
There's nothing to worry about.

185
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,050
Ever since I've started the charity show,

186
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,350
I've been bothered by pranks like these.

187
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,250
Yes, this stew is very delicious indeed.

188
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,350
"Dining Room" -This wine sure is good, too!

189
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,050
Talk about top class!

190
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,050
Ladies and gentlemen, I am greatly thankful

191
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,250
that you have all pleasantly accepted to appear as guests

192
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,150
on the charity show that I will be hosting.

193
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,550
Ms. Suou, may I ask you a question?

194
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,950
What is it?

195
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,150
How did you come across the idea of saving children

196
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,750
whose parents who have become victims of traffic accidents?

197
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,450
I started charity about 15 years ago.

198
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,550
But, to tell the truth, five years before that,

199
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,850
my manager caused a hit-and-run case.

200
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,050
A hit-and-run?

201
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,850
Yes. Ever since then,

202
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,650
I could not stand being indifferent to traffic accidents.

203
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,950
There are people saying that she is a publicity seeker,

204
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,750
but it's really not anything like that.

205
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,350
What happened to the manager after the incident?

206
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,450
She committed suicide.

207
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,550
What?

208
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,050
That manager happened to be my mother.

209
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,650
Your mother?

210
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,550
Since I lost my father at a young age,

211
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,450
after my mother died, I was sent around to my relatives' homes.

212
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,950
I really had it tough.

213
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,050
But, Ms. Suou here helped me in every way she could.

214
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,150
I'm what I am today, thanks to Ms. Suou.

215
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,850
Touya's mother was more a cherished friend of mine than a manager.

216
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,450
There are many at Kurenai Productions

217
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,050
that have lost their families in traffic accidents.

218
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,850
Ms. Suou is putting a lot of effort into helping the children

219
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,850
of traffic accident victims, become independent.

220
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,350
What a touching story!

221
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,450
I'll cooperate as much as I can at your charity show next week.

222
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,050
Same here.

223
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,350
In fact, I lost my wife in a traffic accident 20 years ago.

224
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,650
I'm sure that my wife in heaven is happy

225
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,850
that I'm going to be taking part in Ms. Suou's charity show, too.

226
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,150
"West Wing Third Floor" -I'd like you...

227
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,050
"Suou's Living Quarters" -to investigate something for me, Mr. Mouri.

228
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,550
Yes, I know.

229
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,650
You'd like me to figure out the one who sent out those letters, right?

230
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,950
No.

231
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,350
Well, I wonder if you can check in detail

232
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,150
on the traffic accident that took Mr. Katagiri's wife.

233
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,750
Mr. Katagiri's wife?

234
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,550
May I ask you why?

235
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,050
There is something that bothers me.

236
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,950
Would 2 million yen be enough to do it?

237
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,550
2 million yen?

238
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,550
I'd be more than glad to!

239
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,550
You're pretty good, King of home runs.

240
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,550
It's just luck.

241
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,950
Conan, you're pretty good.

242
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,550
Mr. Mouri, this year is a good year for you to begin something new.

243
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,450
Really?

244
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,350
Why then, Mr. Mouri.

245
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,750
How about making a debut as a singer from our company?

246
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,450
I'm sure it'll make a great hit

247
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,450
if it is sung by the detectives of the Heisei Era, Kogoro Mouri!

248
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,450
I guess I'll sing you a song then.

249
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,250
We're sorry.

250
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,450
Everyone, when the clock strikes midnight...

251
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,950
We have a tradition of locking the door of the room of masks.

252
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,250
When the door is locked,

253
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,650
we will not be able to pass back and forth

254
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,050
between the east and west wings.

255
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,850
Therefore, we would like you to go into your rooms before that.

256
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,450
You're kidding. Midnight is still too early to hit the sack.

257
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,350
Is there a reason for locking the doors at midnight?

258
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,750
They masks of Chableu like pranks

259
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,250
and begin playing on their own come midnight.

260
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,050
Therefore, we must lock the doors and keep them confined.

261
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,050
That's ridiculous.

262
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,550
It's true.

263
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,750
Come morning the masks are tilted unnaturally...

264
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,550
Or down on the floor.

265
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,850
This has happened many times until now.

266
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,350
Now, please go into your rooms, everyone.

267
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,950
How occult can they get?

268
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,460
"East Wing, Second Floor, Guest Room"

269
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,560
His snoring is so noisy that I can't sleep.

270
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,460
An extension phone?

271
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,260
Who are you?

272
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,760
Messenger of the cursed masks.

273
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,160
Messenger of the cursed masks?

274
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,460
Hand it over!

275
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
Hey!

276
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,260
The cursed masks are starving for blood.

277
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,660
Who will be the sacrifice?

278
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,760
What?

279
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
You'd better hurry before it's too late.

280
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,660
That bastard!

281
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,560
It's locked!

282
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,060
Ran, Conan, wake Honami up and bring the key to this room!

283
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,160
Okay!

284
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,160
It's locked.

285
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,260
The phone a while ago was from an extension phone.

286
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,360
The person's in this mansion.

287
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,560
Dad!

288
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,960
Honami, please give me the key!

289
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,060
All right.

290
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,060
Oh, no.

291
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,260
The masks of Chableu are gone!

292
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,860
What is the meaning of this?

293
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,960
What was that?

294
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,660
It came from above.

295
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,460
What? Ms. Suou's bedroom?

296
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,560
You can't go that way!

297
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,660
You have to take the stairs on the west side to get to her room.

298
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,160
This door is locked, too.

299
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,360
I'll wake Minaho and make her open the door!

300
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,260
Hey, what on earth is this racket about?

301
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,560
In the middle of the night.

302
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,360
The masks of Chableu are gone.

303
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,160
What on earth is going on?

304
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,960
Ms. Suou! Ms. Suou!

305
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,160
This door is locked, too!

306
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
Crack that glass!

307
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,260
Mr. Mouri, just what are you going to do?

308
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,660
Is anything wrong with Ms. Suou?

309
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Hey, how's Ms. Suou?

310
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,660
It seems that she's hurt. She bleeding badly!

311
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,560
The masks of Chableu are scattered all over the room!

312
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,160
The masks of Chableu?

313
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,460
Are there any other entrances?

314
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,360
There's another door over there.

315
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,960
That door's no good.

316
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
It's been sealed off for quite a while already.

317
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,260
I'll go in from there and check out the inside.

318
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,660
I guess there is no other choice.

319
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,360
Dad, here you go.

320
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,660
We're counting on you.

321
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,460
The door is locked all right.

322
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,860
It's a double lock, too.

323
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,260
Hurry and go check on Ms. Suou!

324
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,460
Yes.

325
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,460
How is it?

326
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,560
No good. It's too late.

327
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,160
Darn.

328
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,960
Ms. Suou...

329
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,260
-Ms. Suou! -Don't come in. Please stay here.

330
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,960
Slashed in the throat in one blow.

331
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,560
How cruel.

332
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,360
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that this is murder?

333
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,660
It can't be!

334
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,760
The door was locked, wasn't it?

335
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,560
From the looks of the corpse, suicide is impossible.

336
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,360
But...

337
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,560
My curse has been fulfilled.

338
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,960
What was that?

339
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,360
This is a declaration that a murder will be committed.

340
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
From the messenger of the cursed masks.

341
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,860
It's a curse!

342
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,660
The curse of the masks!

343
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,860
She cursed to death by the masks!

344
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,060
Ms. Suou was cursed to death by the masks?

345
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,760
That's ridiculous.

346
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,560
But, the scene of the crime is a locked room.

347
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,360
How on earth did the murderer kill Ms. Suou?

348
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,760
The messenger of the cursed masks.

349
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,060
Yes.

350
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,460
Why didn't you report it to the police

351
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,960
when you first found this letter?

352
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,460
Well, the victim, Ms. Suou mentioned

353
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,660
that she had been receiving similar pranks for some time,

354
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,160
and to not worry about it.

355
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,260
So, these are the cursed masks?

356
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Yes.

357
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,060
We heard a groan and a loud crash.

358
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,760
It could've been the sound of the killer scattering the masks.

359
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,660
You said that this door was locked from inside?

360
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,160
Yes, that's why I cracked the glass above the door,

361
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,260
made Conan go inside and verified Ms. Suou's death.

362
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,960
The door was definitely locked.

363
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,260
Both two locks on the door.

364
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
-Two locks? -Yes.

365
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,660
Ms. Suou always locked both locks on her door.

366
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,660
This door lock...

367
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,760
and then this padlock.

368
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,460
Why did the victim have two locks on her door?

369
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,660
Well, according to her secretary, Ms. Inaba,

370
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,160
when Ms. Suou went to have the curse of the masks

371
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,860
sealed in by a clairvoyant,

372
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,860
she was told to carry out several things.

373
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,360
One of them was to put two locks on the bedroom door.

374
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,560
A clairvoyant?

375
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,060
Which means that the victim herself opened the door

376
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,560
and let the victim in?

377
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,960
Well, it doesn't seem so.

378
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
It seems that Ms. Suou was suffering from insomnia lately,

379
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,760
and was taking sleeping pills.

380
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,560
That's why there were no traces of the victim had struggled?

381
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,160
If the victim locked the door as usual,

382
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,960
had sleeping pills and went to bed,

383
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,360
how did the killer get into the room?

384
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,160
What is this door?

385
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,560
There is a bedroom next door too,

386
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,060
but that door seems to have been closed off for many years.

387
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,760
It seems to be nailed shut,

388
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,460
and there are no traces of it having been opened.

389
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,060
The railing above the door, is that bar removable?

390
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,460
I checked on it, but it was not.

391
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
The space between the bars is about 5 or 6 centimeters,

392
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,960
so not even an arm can go through.

393
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,660
How about that window on the other side?

394
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,860
That window is fixed on.

395
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,260
There is nothing abnormal about it.

396
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,660
If so, how and where did the killer go in and out of this room?

397
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,860
The only door that could be opened and shut was locked from the inside.

398
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,060
The door to the bedroom next door is nailed and sealed.

399
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,960
The space between the bars above it

400
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,160
is so narrow that not even an arm can get through.

401
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,860
The windows are both fixed on

402
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,160
and there seems to be nothing wrong with them.

403
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,860
It's also impossible for the victim herself to have opened the door

404
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,660
and let the killer in, because she was under the effect of sleeping pills.

405
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,460
The room is a locked room where you can't get in or get out of.

406
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,060
I wonder if Ms. Suou really drank the sleeping pill herself?

407
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,660
If she didn't drink it herself, who would make her...

408
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,760
Wait a sec.

409
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,860
I've got it, inspector!

410
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,060
What? Is that true?

411
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,360
The killer met Ms. Suou in the middle of the night,

412
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,760
made her drink something with a sleeping pill in it,

413
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,060
put her to sleep.

414
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,360
Then, the killer carries Ms. Suou to her bed on the bed

415
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,560
and kills her there.

416
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,660
I see.

417
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,660
And, how did the killer lock the door when leaving the room?

418
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,160
That? Well...

419
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I don't know just yet.

420
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,460
Yes.

421
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,460
Only half of the locked room mystery can be explained.

422
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,460
The door is the only possible way that the killer could've come in from,

423
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,760
but how on earth did the killer lock the door from the outside?

424
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,460
If the lock were just a handle that could be turned,

425
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,160
then using a string or something may unlock it.

426
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,460
But, the padlock is the problem.

427
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,960
In order to lock this, the door has to be closed first.

428
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,260
Then the door and the metal piece on the door frame has to be matched.

429
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Only after doing so, can the pole

430
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,460
be stuck into the two metal fixtures.

431
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,860
I feel that it is impossible to do all this from outside the door.

432
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,760
What kind of trick did the killer use anyway?

433
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
No matter what trick the killer used,

434
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
why didn't the killer make it look like a suicide,

435
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,760
after doing all this to kill her?

436
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,460
The killer called our room just before the murder was committed.

437
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,160
As if to let us know beforehand that murder was going to take place.

438
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,260
This knife seems to be the murder weapon.

439
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,460
This is what was decorated in the room of the masks.

440
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,060
It was poked into the bed pole, but there's something odd.

441
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,260
As you can see, the handle of it is also smeared with blood.

442
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
It sure is odd.

443
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,260
If the killer is holding the handle, there should be no blood there.

444
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,460
Talking of blood,

445
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,960
there were masks among the masks that were scattered on the floor

446
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,860
with blood splattered on them, too.

447
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,860
This was found on the bed.

448
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,160
It seems to have been splattered with blood at close range.

449
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,960
I think that the killer was wearing this mask

450
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
when committing the murder.

451
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,560
If so, there may be some traces of the killer left.

452
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,360
Are there other masks that have been splattered with blood?

453
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,260
Yes, but it's quite strange.

454
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,160
All the other masks had blood only around the mouth.

455
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,760
There is a spook story concerning the masks

456
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,960
that says the masks sip the blood of the people who own them.

457
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,560
Don't be silly.

458
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,860
Could the killer have scattered the masks

459
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,060
to confuse investigations with occult stories?

460
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,560
That's most likely.

461
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,660
I wonder if that's the only reason why the killer scattered the masks?

462
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,760
No, I'm sure there is some other reason.

463
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,160
If I could only figure that out...

464
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,360
Inspector!

465
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,260
Officer Kobayashi, how was it?

466
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,160
We checked every nook and cranny surrounding the mansion,

467
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,060
but maybe because of the snow that has accumulated,

468
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,260
there are no signs of the killer has gone in or out.

469
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,360
Which means that the killer is...

470
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,860
A person that is within the mansion.

471
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,560
Aside from Mr. Mouri and his family,

472
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
those who were in this mansion are

473
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,960
the photographer, Masanori Katagiri,

474
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,560
pro baseball player, Mamoru Matsudaira,

475
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,060
popular Fortune-teller, Haruka Nagara,

476
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,460
rock singer, Touya Aikawa,

477
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,760
the victim's secretary, Kazuyo Inaba,

478
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,660
and the twin maids, Minaho and Honami Shimogasa.

479
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,660
A total of 7 people.

480
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,760
We can narrow down the suspects a bit more.

481
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,060
What do you mean?

482
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,260
You can't get to Ms. Suou's bedroom which is on the 3rd floor,

483
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,160
without using the stairs of the west wing.

484
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,960
At the time of the incident,

485
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,460
the doors leading to the east and west wings were both locked.

486
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,460
This has already been verified.

487
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,360
In other words, you couldn't pass from the east wing

488
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,060
to the west wing at that time.

489
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,160
Which means that the killer is someone

490
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
who was in the west wing of the mansion.

491
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,360
Who were in what rooms?

492
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,060
First, on the 1st floor of the east wing,

493
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,760
were Mr. Aikawa and Honami.

494
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,460
In the west wing were Ms. Inaba and Minaho.

495
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,860
On the 2nd floor east wing were we three.

496
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,360
In the west wing, were Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira

497
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,160
and Haruka.

498
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,660
I see.

499
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,660
There are five suspects.

500
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,060
Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira, Ms. Nagara,

501
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,560
Ms. Inaba and Minaho.

502
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes, the messenger of the cursed masks

503
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,160
are among the five.

504
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,670
Everyone.

505
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,270
I hate to have to do this, knowing how tired you all must be,

506
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,870
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

507
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,770
The incident occurred,

508
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,670
in the wee hours of the morning at around 2:30.

509
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,770
Please tell me in order, what you were doing at that time.

510
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,670
First, Honami.

511
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,270
I was fast asleep in my room until Ran came to wake me.

512
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,170
You got the key and headed for the 2nd floor?

513
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,470
Where do you keep the key?

514
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,270
On the kitchen wall that is next to this dining room.

515
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,370
So anybody could take it and use it at will?

516
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,070
But, the key was definitely there at that time.

517
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,270
-Ran? -She's right.

518
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,570
Are there any spare keys?

519
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,270
They are old keys, so we can't make spares.

520
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,670
When we unlocked the door and went into the room of masks,

521
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,870
we noticed that the masks of Chableu were gone.

522
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,670
That was when we heard the groan and loud noise from the 3rd floor.

523
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,770
Yes, and while we were waking Minaho on the extension phone,

524
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,070
Aikawa came along.

525
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,170
I was sleeping in my room on the 1st floor, too.

526
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,870
I realized that they had come to wake Minaho,

527
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,470
but I didn't think it was a big deal.

528
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,070
Then, it started getting noisy,

529
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,170
so I went to the 2nd floor to check things out.

530
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,970
I was awakened by Honami on the extension phone,

531
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,370
took the key and went to the 2nd floor.

532
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,470
I was also sleeping in my room,

533
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,170
but since it started to get noisy outside,

534
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,570
I got up and went out into the corridor,

535
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,870
just as Minaho had come up the stairs.

536
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,970
Same with me.

537
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,270
Me, too.

538
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,870
Ms. Inaba, I heard that you did not appear

539
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,170
at the time the corpse was found?

540
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:11,570
I over drank wine last night and was totally passed out.

541
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,270
So, you didn't realize all the racket going on?

542
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,370
No...

543
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,970
Mr. Katagiri, have you ever met Ms. Suou before?

544
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,270
No, I met her for the first time yesterday.

545
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,070
Why did you ask?

546
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,970
Ms. Suou asked me to check on the traffic accident

547
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,870
that took your wife's life 20 years ago.

548
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,770
Ms. Suou did? Why?

549
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,870
Do you have any idea why?

550
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,070
No, I don't.

551
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,570
Ms. Suou asked Pops to check on the traffic accident

552
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,170
that took Mr. Katagiri's wife's life?

553
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,570
Why would she want to check on a traffic accident

554
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,270
that happened 20 years ago?

555
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,170
Your mother got into a traffic accident 20 years ago too,

556
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,570
didn't she, Mr. Aikawa?

557
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,070
Yes, that's right.

558
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,870
Don't tell me that... Mr. Katagiri?

559
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,070
Will you tell us about the traffic accident that took your wife's life?

560
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,170
You'll find out sooner or later even if I didn't tell you.

561
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,670
Yes, my wife was the victim of the traffic accident

562
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,870
that Mr. Aikawa's mother had caused.

563
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,770
No way.

564
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,770
Didn't you know about it, Mr. Aikawa?

565
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,670
No. Because I was still only six years old.

566
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,770
But, how is that traffic accident connected to today's murder case?

567
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:32,470
The police think that the murderer is among us, isn't that right?

568
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,570
What?

569
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,070
Oh, no. Is that true, inspector?

570
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,970
Oh, no, not really...

571
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,970
I recall that it had stopped snowing after 12:00

572
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,370
I'll bet you couldn't find traces of the killer on the snow?

573
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,770
Is she right, inspector?

574
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,670
It can't be helped.

575
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,570
Yes, it's true that there are no traces of the killer

576
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,670
having entered or left the mansion.

577
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,270
Oh, no.

578
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,570
You mean the killer is among us?

579
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,070
Moreover, since the room of masks was locked,

580
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,670
the killer has to be one of the five that was in the west wing.

581
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,670
Mr. Katagiri, Haruka, Ms Inaba, Mr. Matsudaira and Minaho.

582
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,670
What? Wait a second.

583
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,270
That was a strange remark.

584
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,070
Why that remark?

585
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,170
But, it's difficult to determine the suspect.

586
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,070
I think there is a way.

587
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,570
Don't tell me that you're going to find the killer

588
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,170
using your cards, are you?

589
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,770
From the looks of the scene of the crime,

590
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,370
killer probably was splattered by a lot of blood.

591
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,970
Although it is possible to avoid blood on the face by wearing the mask,

592
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,970
it would not be as easily remove the blood from the hair and body.

593
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,970
I see!

594
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,970
The killer is someone who had time

595
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,970
to wipe off the blood that splattered on.

596
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,470
What? Are you saying that I'm the killer?

597
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,070
The only person who had time to wipe blood off

598
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,570
is you, because you weren't at the scene where the body was found.

599
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,070
You've got to be kidding!

600
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,570
Why would I have to kill Ms. Suou?

601
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,270
Hey, you!

602
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,970
Cut out your nonsense!

603
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,170
Please calm down!

604
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,770
You fraud fortune-teller!

605
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,670
That's what happened.

606
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,470
I was completely deceived by the trap that the killer had set.

607
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,470
But, the trick's over.

608
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,270
I've figured out the curse of the masks!

609
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,770
What's up, Conan?

610
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,170
Mr. Mouri says he has a favor to ask you.

611
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,370
What?

612
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,470
What is it? Hey, what?

613
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,970
On the chest over there. Take a look at it.

614
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,070
What a nuisance.

615
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,970
There's nothing here.

616
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,470
Leave the rest to me, Pops.

617
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,670
So, this is the bedroom next door.

618
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:45,570
So a bedroom that looks just like Ms. Suou's was right next door.

619
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,470
Yes. This room, with the same structure

620
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,170
as that of the room where the crime took place,

621
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,870
is what helped solve the mystery of the locked doors

622
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,970
as well as reveal the identity of the killer.

623
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,270
What? You mean Ms. Inaba is not the killer?

624
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,370
I've been saying that I'm not!!

625
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,070
Have you solved the mystery of the locked doors?

626
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,170
Yes, I've figured everything out.

627
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,570
Who on earth is the killer?

628
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,070
The killer who killed Ms. Beniko Suou in a locked room,

629
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,470
the "messenger of the cursed mask" is...

630
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,670
you!

631
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,560
The "messenger of the cursed mask" is...

632
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
you!

633
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,260
Mr. Touya Aikawa!

634
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,760
What?

635
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,860
No way.

636
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,060
Oh, no.

637
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,260
What on earth are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

638
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,560
How could I, who was in the east wing of the mansion

639
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,060
have gone to Ms. Suou's bedroom?

640
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,760
Yes, indeed you could not go to Ms. Suou's bedroom.

641
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,860
In order to prove that,

642
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,560
you called us on the extension phone,

643
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,960
just before you committed the murder.

644
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,560
But, if he couldn't go to her bedroom,

645
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,960
how could he have committed the crime?

646
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,060
I've been suspicious from the time the body was found.

647
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,460
I kept thinking of why the killer, despite having committed the crime

648
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,560
behind a locked door, did not make her death look to be suicide.

649
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,760
It was because he couldn't.

650
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,960
Mr. Aikawa

651
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,060
killed Ms. Suou without entering her bedroom at all.

652
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,460
-What? -Without going into her bedroom?

653
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Impossible.

654
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,460
It's possible, with the help of the cursed masks.

655
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,860
Don't tell me that you really believe in things such as curses?

656
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,360
No. But the masks of Chableu are indeed

657
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,960
the key to committing murder behind locked doors.

658
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,060
I will replay that method here.

659
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,860
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

660
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I borrowed a knife that is similar to the murder weapon.

661
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,760
There is a rubber rope

662
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
attached through the hole at the rear end of the handle.

663
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Next for the mask.

664
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,560
The rubber rope is passed through both eyes of all the masks.

665
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,160
And the rubber rope attached to the knife

666
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,660
is passed through the mouth hole of all the masks.

667
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,660
After all of us went to bed, Mr. Aikawa

668
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,560
went to the kitchen to get the key to enter the room of masks.

669
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,060
He stole the masks of Chableu and a knife,

670
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,160
then locked the door and returned the key to the kitchen.

671
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,160
He brought the masks and knife into this room,

672
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,860
and carried on with the rubber rope trick.

673
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,960
He dropped the masks and the knife into Ms. Suou's bedroom

674
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,160
through the space between the railing.

675
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,860
The size of the space is 5X5 centimeters.

676
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,860
A thin mask would easily slide through.

677
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,160
Can you really solve the mystery of the locked door

678
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,560
doing something like this?

679
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,860
Well, please watch.

680
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,560
This is the last mask!

681
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,960
After placing all the masks inside the room,

682
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,160
he pulled the rubber rope towards himself.

683
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,260
Now everyone, since the mask is 15 millimeters thick,

684
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
if 200 are piled up one on top of the other,

685
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,160
the pile would be 3 meters.

686
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,460
The position of the neck of the victim asleep in bed

687
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,360
was about 3.5 meters from the railing.

688
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,160
So, then what...

689
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,960
This...

690
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,960
From the edge of the knife to the victim's throat is only 10 centimeters.

691
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
All he had left to do now,

692
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,560
was to push the masks out using a ruler or something.

693
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,560
By using these stairs that only the people

694
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,860
who are in the east wing of the mansion can climb,

695
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,060
This way, Mr. Aikawa killed Ms. Suou

696
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,860
without setting foot into her room at all.

697
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
I see!

698
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,860
One of the masks was badly covered blood

699
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,660
because it was the mask on the very top, wasn't it?

700
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,060
The reason why several masks had blood by the mouth,

701
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,360
was because Ms. Suou's blood splattered on them.

702
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,460
And he finally severs the rubber rope that was passed through

703
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,460
the eyes of the masks and the handle of the knife.

704
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,660
This is...

705
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,060
So, that's it for the locked door mystery.

706
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,260
It's all baloney!

707
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,560
Just where do you have the proof that I used that trick!

708
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,660
Mr. Aikawa, you're acting in bad grace.

709
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,260
Haven't you realized that you've already confessed

710
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,360
that you are the killer?

711
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,660
What? What do you mean?

712
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,360
While you were being questioned a while ago,

713
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,460
you said, "I noticed that the kids came to wake Honami up".

714
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,660
Yes, because I was in my room on the first floor then!

715
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,060
When you said, "Those kids" who and Ran were you referring to?

716
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Who else but the kid named Conan!

717
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,860
How strange.

718
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,760
I didn't say a word back then,

719
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,160
and yet how did you know I was with Ran?

720
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
That's because...

721
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,560
Right, I opened the door a bit and looked out.

722
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,660
That's why I know that he was with her.

723
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,660
-Really? -Really.

724
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,960
Then, it's even stranger.

725
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,160
Because I didn't go with Ran.

726
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,860
I went to check if the doors around the house were locked.

727
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,760
No way.

728
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,060
Is that true?

729
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,260
Yes.

730
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I went to Honami's room alone.

731
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,060
I did tell Ran and Conan to go get Honami back then.

732
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,460
Didn't you think that they went together to Honami's room

733
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,160
because when you heard me say so,

734
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,860
you were in the room on the 3rd floor?

735
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,060
Only because of something like that, you...

736
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,460
Touya! After all she did for you, how could you?

737
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,360
Shut up! After all she did for me?

738
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,860
You've got to be kidding!

739
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,660
That woman blamed the hit-and-run accident that she caused on my mother,

740
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,260
and made it look as if she committed suicide!

741
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,860
Is that true?

742
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,060
It's true.

743
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,660
Although I found out about it just 2 months ago.

744
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,860
I was cleaning out my mother's belongings

745
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,460
when a letter fell out from behind the cover of her diary

746
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,260
and the truth about the incident was written in it.

747
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,560
That's a lie! It's all baloney!

748
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,260
No, it's not! My mother had an alibi!

749
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,860
The accident occurred on the night of October 31st.

750
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,360
October 31?

751
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,560
Touya's birthday.

752
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,660
Right! My mother was with me right through on that day!

753
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,860
Which means that the one who hit-and-run my wife

754
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,460
was Suou.

755
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,960
Moreover, she didn't even know that your wife

756
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
was the victim of a traffic accident, Mr. Katagiri!

757
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,860
I guess she asked me to investigate on the case,

758
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,660
after she heard Mr. Katagiri talk about it at dinner.

759
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,160
Ms. Suou is a fine person who has been hosting charity shows for 15 years!

760
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,560
What a laugh!

761
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,960
That woman embezzled the money that was raised to fatten her own pocket!

762
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,460
You're lying! Ms. Suou would never do any such thing...

763
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,760
You also got part of the cash, didn't you?

764
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,460
You're not playing dumb with me!

765
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,860
I wanted to keep Mr. Katagiri from participating

766
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,360
in this corrupt charity no matter what.

767
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,860
That woman...

768
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,360
Beniko Suou was a devil wearing the mask of a person practicing goodwill!

769
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Just to think that I felt grateful

770
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,760
for her having saved me, all these years...

771
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:01,860
It could be that Mr. Aikawa was possessed by the curse of the masks.

772
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,560
Curses are only superstitions!

773
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,460
Curse! This is a curse!

774
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,560
That's no curse. It's just that you're a klutz, Pops.

775
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,340
Next Conan's Hint

776
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,000
"Rain Shower​"
