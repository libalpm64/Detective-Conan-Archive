1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,840
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,640
Queer actions after committing the crime.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,040
An accident or a case of homicide. What is the hidden truth?

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,360
Oh no... not again.

9
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Why is it that all the cars you rent

10
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,660
always break down, dad?

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,760
We can't even use the cell phone in the mountains like this.

12
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,260
We've got no choice but to wait for the fog to clear.

13
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,660
Hey, don't smoke in a small place like this!

14
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,460
Shut up! I'll open the window, okay?

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Gosh, now what...

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
It's nothing.

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,260
Ran, I'll bet you're scared.

18
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,060
That there's a mountain monster

19
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,960
looking at us from somewhere.

20
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,460
I can't hear you, I can't hear a thing!

21
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,760
Just as I though...

22
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,360
Gosh, hopeless...

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,060
Oh, it's a car.

24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,760
Saved...

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,260
It turned the corner.

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Wait a second.

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,260
Was there are side road there?

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,060
Pops, which means the car we just saw...

29
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,260
Yeah.

30
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,660
It could've been an apparition.

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,760
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 1)"

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,860
Hey, hey, let's not...

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Don't worry.

34
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,460
You saw the sign, didn't you?

35
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,260
It's a study facility for a legitimate company.

36
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
The people of the company

37
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
would never be in a place like this at this time!

38
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,160
I'm sure the car we just saw is a robber's car or something.

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,460
What the...

40
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,560
I'll go first and check things out!

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,260
Be careful!

42
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
Oh, it's a car.

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
It still warm.

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,260
It's a cute car.

45
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,460
What a relief!

46
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,960
Bad people don't ride cars like this, do they?

47
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,360
There seems to be a lot of other cars. See.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,960
This one is warmer!

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,460
The car that came in here just a while ago is probably this car!

50
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,360
This car is still warm too.

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
Which means...

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,060
There are people here for sure!

53
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,460
-Let's go! -Okay!

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,860
Kuron Health Equipment Corporation.

55
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,760
I've never heard of them.

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
You two, mind your manners.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
Yes, sir!

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,460
Hello!

59
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,960
Is anyone in?

60
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,560
They couldn't be sleeping at this hour yet, could they...

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
What it is?

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm sorry to be intruding on you at this hour,

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,660
but our car broke down nearby.

64
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,160
So, you see, we're stalled in this fog,

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,960
so we would like to ask you for some help.

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,660
Please go find someone else to help you,

67
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,760
because I'm going to get busy from now.

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,360
Wait!

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Please at least lend us your phone! Please!

70
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,660
Please wait!

71
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,860
Wait.

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,960
Hey!

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,160
What a guy.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,960
I promise that if I die, I'll come and haunt you!

75
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,060
Darn.

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,360
I guess we'll just have to go back to the car.

77
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,160
It's cold.

78
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,560
You seem to be in trouble.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,960
Please do come in.

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,860
Wow, is it okay?

81
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,160
Thank you so very much!

82
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
What a fix, eh.

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,960
This is a study facility for the company

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,260
that there's usually no one here.

85
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,760
The phone's over there.

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,360
Thank you.

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,860
Are you sure it's okay?

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,160
What if they're spies?

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,860
Talk about push over,

90
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,060
or rather is it that you have a lot of elbow room

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,760
because you're in the 1st development section?

92
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,660
I heard you all!

93
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Oh, president.

94
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,760
Just what are you guys doing?

95
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,560
We're sorry to be intruding on you,

96
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
but we're not suspicious people.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,960
I am a private detective and my name is Kogoro Mouri.

98
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,460
Mouri, you mean that famous "Sleeping Mouri"?

99
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,360
Yes, well...

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,660
this is my daughter Ran,

101
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,060
and the little one there is Conan.

102
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,760
Oh my,

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,460
I am very honored to be able meet you.

104
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,760
I am the president of Kuron Health Equipment Corporation, Umetani.

105
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Please make yourselves at home here.

106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,260
Oh, that's right!

107
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,060
Mr. Mouri, please become a monitor for us!

108
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,860
How about it?

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,160
We having an in-company competition on a relax sheet,

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,960
and we would appreciate it if you could give us

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,860
your unbiased opinion how you feel about it.

112
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,760
Oh...

113
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,160
There, right there.

114
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
This is just great.

115
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
It feels so good!

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,860
Dad, you're so embarrassing.

117
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,560
I've never experienced a great massage chair like this!

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,460
It fits right into the vital spot.

119
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,060
Yes, the combination of the softness of tanned hide

120
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,560
and the combination of artificial leather for durability

121
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,460
makes for a sensation of perfect fit.

122
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,860
Just as expected of the 1st development section!

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,760
Well done, Nakano!

124
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,460
But, president.

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,860
That artificial leather you take pride in is made in Italy!

126
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,060
Moreover, for the massager part,

127
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,260
high grade silicone rubber is lavishly used!

128
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,460
Therefore, the production cost is too high.

129
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,160
What? What is the meaning of this, Nakano?

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,860
The original parts of the basic components such as the rollers,

131
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,860
are of the same product line as what we've used so far,

132
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,460
so as far as that's concerned, the cost is...

133
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,360
You idiot!

134
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,960
Never mind durability!

135
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,760
But, even if we don't make much profit,

136
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,360
so long as we produce good items to our customers,

137
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
eventually...

138
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,760
Eventually is not what we're after!

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,160
Make profit for me right this minute!

140
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,060
Rather, what I mean is,

141
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,760
if we don't keep dishing out new products,

142
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,660
the customers will give up on us.

143
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Next!

144
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,860
That president is kind of scary, isn't he?

145
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah.

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,760
Next for the 2nd development section's Ecstasy One.

147
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,960
This product is made for the younger generation.

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,560
Please take a look.

149
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
This seat is a cover-type seat.

150
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
There are 7 color variations and the color of the customer's choice

151
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,360
can be chosen to meet any type of interior.

152
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,160
The back part of the seat can be reclined to any angle,

153
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,560
and it can also be used in the living room as a sofa.

154
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,860
I see,

155
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,660
it sure seems to be great for a young person's room!

156
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,060
You move this device using the remote controller

157
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,160
that is in the side pocket.

158
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,960
First, let's start with full body massage...

159
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,760
Are you sleepy, Conan?

160
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,460
Stop it already.

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,660
What on earth is this?

162
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,960
It's made for young people

163
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,760
so maybe it's too strong for you, Mr. Mouri?

164
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,460
I'll switch it to weak sleep mode.

165
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,960
No thanks!

166
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Relieve my tiredness, my foot!

167
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,760
My whole body feels as if it's going to fall apart!

168
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
But...

169
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,460
Kasahara! That's enough.

170
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,860
-Oh, well... -Next! Hiramatsu!

171
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,660
Yes.

172
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,060
Hey, hey, what's this?

173
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,760
Are you going to beat up some monster?

174
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Come to think of it,

175
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,960
my child has a toy that looks something like this.

176
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,160
Really, it looks like some robot animation.

177
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,960
Well, take a look at it, please.

178
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,160
Oh, yes, right there!

179
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,460
Right, just great, right there!

180
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,060
Dad?

181
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,160
How does this thing know just where I want to be massaged?

182
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,360
Right! That's exactly what the main feature

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
of this business type AIMS is all about!

184
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,060
A micro sensor detects the part of your body that is stiff

185
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,360
and massages with the exact strength needed.

186
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,560
Sounds like a great function,

187
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,160
but I'll bet the cost is really high.

188
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,560
No, the only thing new is the program,

189
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,960
and the rest involves diverting what was being used till now,

190
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,960
so I think the cost is less than half of what your cost is!

191
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,160
Besides, with a function as good as that,

192
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,360
it'll probably sell even if the price is a bit high.

193
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
Yes.

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,960
So! I'll think over which machine I'll sell

195
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,360
while taking a smoke.

196
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,860
Mr. Mouri, do make yourself at home too!

197
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,260
Thank you. I don't want to come out just yet.

198
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,960
Well, it feels so good, I feel like falling asleep.

199
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,560
Dad, you're interfering everybody with their work!

200
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,360
It's okay, because it seems he's already decided so...

201
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,160
Things are moving really fast today, don't you think?

203
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,060
It seems like the rumor about behind the scenes negotiations

204
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,160
was true after all.

205
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,960
It's probably because Mr. Mouri played monitor for us.

206
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,060
President didn't even have to think about it,

207
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,360
but I guess he just wanted to emphasize his importance.

208
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,060
I get it!

209
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,060
Maybe the rumor about the development section

210
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,860
going to be downsized is true!

211
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Maybe he's thinking over which development section

212
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,060
to shut down now.

213
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,460
By the way, Mr. Kasahara, your seat

214
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,060
pushes at the vital points even if it isn't moving.

215
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,260
It's so lumpy!

216
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,460
What? How dare you...

217
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,260
Please calm down, Mr. Kasahara!

218
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,860
Thank you everyone!

219
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,460
May you all work together in peace.

220
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,360
I hope all of your inventions end up being marketed.

221
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,660
It's all your fault!

222
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,960
You're to blame for this.

223
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Right, you do monitor for him,

224
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,660
representing the young generation, Ran!

225
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,760
No, I'd rather not...

226
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Where's Conan?

227
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,060
Conan! What are you doing?

228
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,160
Don't touch things here!

229
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,660
Isn't this a knife? It's dangerous!

230
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,360
But, I wonder if it's for real.

231
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,160
It's real!

232
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,860
The president is a famous knife collector.

233
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,360
There's a lot of talk about his collection with our clients,

234
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,760
so he has a lot decorated at the company too.

235
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,060
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

236
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,560
I've made up my mind!

237
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,760
We're going to put AIMS of the 3rd development section on the market!

238
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,160
And, we're going to consolidate the first

239
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,660
and second development sections into one section.

240
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,960
Will everyone except Hiramatsu leave the room?

241
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,560
-President! -I'll talk to you later!

242
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,160
Thank you so much also, Mr. Mouri.

243
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Please relax in the reception corner.

244
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,960
After we finish work, I'd like to talk with you over drinks.

245
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,160
Wow, that'd be just great!

246
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,360
Okay, I'll be waiting then.

247
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,560
They can't dispatch a repair car until the fog clears up after all.

248
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,860
I'll bet you're really relieved

249
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,560
because you can drink all you like now!

250
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,960
Well, I guess I'll go make some coffee then.

251
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Oh, let me help you!

252
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,060
I have to go to the restroom.

253
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,360
The restroom's beyond the room we were in just a while ago.

254
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,660
It's the second door to your left.

255
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,760
Okay!

256
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,660
Please nullify my contract with you!

257
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,560
I'm fed up having to work under you!

258
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,760
Do I look like a softy who would say, "Yes, of course",

259
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,960
and nullify our contract?

260
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
No...

261
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
so I have already made appropriate arrangements.

262
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,860
So, that you would by no means refuse to do so.

263
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm definite that you won't refuse.

264
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,180
They're sure taking their time.

265
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,280
He's probably being threatened

266
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,180
and signing a ruthless contract or something.

267
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Serves him right.

268
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
A ruthless contract?

269
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,280
Yes.

270
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,880
What does it mean to nullify a contract?

271
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,980
Gosh!

272
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,280
Keep out of this, kid!

273
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,580
Sonny, did you hear Hiramatsu say so to the president?

274
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,480
Don't tell me Hiramatsu's planning to quit the company?

275
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Which means that you're all contract employees?

276
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,380
Yes, when the president finds a talented developer,

277
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,880
he forces the developer to sign a long-term contract with him,

278
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,480
and makes it difficult for the person to quit easily.

279
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,580
By force? No.

280
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,880
It's true.

281
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,280
The president's physique is as you saw him.

282
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Besides, he carries a "dan" in karate.

283
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,380
Even if he doesn't really hit you and stops just before hitting,

284
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,880
a weak hearted person would panic

285
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
and sign the contract immediately.

286
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,480
Oh, no.

287
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,680
Well, Kasahara and I have been here

288
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
since the previous president was our boss,

289
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,880
so we've been spared that karate scare

290
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,480
but all the young staff are being tempered here

291
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,080
at this study dormitory.

292
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,680
Moreover, he takes advantage of tax exemptions

293
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,380
and uses company funds to cover everything

294
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,680
from his hobby of collecting knives to giving gifts to women.

295
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,080
Even on our way here... take a look at this!

296
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,680
What's that?

297
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,880
Strange, that's the sound of a car...

298
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,880
It's Mr. Hiramatsu's car.

299
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
I wonder what's going on.

300
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,380
The window on the other side!

301
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,680
It's open.

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,080
No way?

303
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,580
Conan?

304
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,680
-This is? -President.

305
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,780
President? President!

306
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,580
Please get a hold of yourself!

307
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,480
Please stay back!

308
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,680
Mr. Umetani, are you okay?

309
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,680
He's still breathing!

310
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,780
President!

311
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,980
Ran! Get the ambulance and the police!

312
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,080
Yes!

313
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,780
Let's leave the rest to Ran and go after Mr. Hiramatsu!

314
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,180
The car in the foreground!

315
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,880
I've got the keys.

316
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,180
It's the president's but I drive it so...

317
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,680
Wait! There's a flat!

318
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,980
This side is super flat too!

319
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,780
The tires of my car are flat too!

320
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,180
Darn!

321
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,180
In the mountains like this,

322
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,980
it's faster to take him to the hospital by car

323
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,980
than to wait for an ambulance but...

324
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,580
-Oh, president. -President!

325
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,780
Mr. Umetani.

326
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,180
President, please get a hold of yourself!

327
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,080
The knife fell off!

328
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
What's going on?

329
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,080
This is?

330
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,380
The knife poked into the cigar case!

331
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,580
Which means that the cigar case saved his life?

332
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
-President! -Thank god!

333
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,380
Mr. Umetani, what in the world happened?

334
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,180
Hiramatsu suddenly stabbed me with a knife.

335
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,980
It seems that there was a thick fog at the time of the accident

336
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,780
and besides this slope is steep and the curve is very sharp...

337
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,380
It's most likely that he couldn't steer fast enough

338
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,680
while he was on the run.

339
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,480
Yeah, most likely...

340
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,680
All the tires of the other cars were flat,

341
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,280
so there was no reason for him to rush as much as he did, though.

342
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,280
If he could think on that line,

343
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,380
he wouldn't have gotten enraged and stab somebody.

344
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,280
Exactly!

345
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Just as expected of you Mr. Mouri, very sharp deduction!

346
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,480
Well...

347
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,180
Well, the victim is only slightly hurt,

348
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,980
so we'll be able to get at the motive of the stabber right away.

349
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,080
Right.

350
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Sonny! What are you doing?

351
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,380
You shouldn't be in here.

352
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,180
What's this mirror?

353
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,980
Oh, that?

354
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,580
It's called a corner mirror.

355
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,780
From here on down, it's the land of that company

356
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,180
and it's a private road.

357
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,580
It seems that nobody is here now, though.

358
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,880
See, there's the sign of the company.

359
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,480
It says public welfare facility.

360
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Well, it's like a company villa.

361
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
This large rock is really a pain

362
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,280
and it blocks vision when going in and out

363
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,780
making it really dangerous.

364
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,380
On this side, there's this sharp curve too.

365
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,780
There's a curve mirror there for the public road too.

366
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,580
Because I'm in charge around here,

367
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,980
I wanted a corner mirror for the private road!

368
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
I see.

369
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,980
The position of the mirror is not right.

370
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,380
It's good that they made a large one,

371
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,480
but I wonder if the wind blows it out of place.

372
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
It was okay in the day time!

373
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,180
Oh, I think it's better not to fix it.

374
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,280
It could've been the reason the accident occurred, right?

375
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,880
Oh, no!

376
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,680
And, Mr. Mouri wants you to check the brakes of the car right away!

377
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,780
Mr. Mouri want me to?

378
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,880
I see!

379
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,380
The brakes may have not been working.

380
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,480
I'll ask using the wireless so wait a while, okay?

381
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,780
Conan!

382
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,480
Just what are you doing in a place like this!

383
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,680
Dad's angry because he wants you to come back up.

384
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,980
Hurry, quick.

386
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,680
Oh, wait.

387
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,180
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

388
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,680
I tell you! Stop scampering around!

389
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm going to leave you here!

390
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,880
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,080
Calm down, Mr. Mouri.

392
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,480
Mr. Mouri!

393
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,780
Inspector Yokomizo!

394
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,680
About your question a while ago...

395
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,980
It seems that the brake oil of the car was completely gone.

396
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,380
-Huh? -What did you just say?

397
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,080
I can't tell for sure whether it happened

398
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
because of the shock of the accident

399
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,280
or whether it happened before the accident,

400
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,380
but the tube seems to have come off.

401
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,780
Which means, Mr. Mouri...

402
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,280
the oil leaked out and the brakes may not have been working.

403
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,080
It's only natural for him to have gotten into an accident

404
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,180
on this mountainous road.

405
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,480
Strange.

406
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,180
There are too many strange things involved.

407
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,280
A person who gets enraged, stabs someone and flees,

408
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,580
flattens the tires of everyone's car

409
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,880
because he doesn't want anyone to come after him.

410
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,280
This same person panics and steers his car out of control,

411
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,480
and falls over the cliff to his death.

412
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,580
The curve mirror that was facing the wrong way.

413
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,280
Brake oil that was completely gone.

414
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,080
Something smells fishy.

415
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,980
Very fishy!

416
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,660
"Cigar"

418
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,180
Dad, which of the massage chairs was good?

419
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,920
I can't tell unless I get to drink some beer.

420
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,280
Talk about hopeless.
