1
00:00:02,346 --> 00:00:05,985
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,987
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,346
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:13,446
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,046
"Gin, Shuichi Akai" -Behind the suffocating sink or swim ploys,

6
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:20,946
"Vermouth" -lies hidden yet another plan.

7
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:22,546
Rena Mizunashi agrees to go back to the Organization

8
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:25,446
after getting the FBI to agree to apply the Witness Protection Program

9
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:28,646
to her younger brother, Eisuke.

10
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,146
Several days later, we encounter the homicide case

11
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,746
of a president of a foreign talent production office

12
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:38,746
at the hotel we go to eat a buffet lunch.

13
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:42,021
But, to our surprise, one of the suspects of this murder

14
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,346
turns out to be FBI agent, Camel.

15
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,746
"James Black, Jodie Starling" -Okay Conan, I'll be right over.

16
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:51,546
Oh, Jodie.

17
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:54,033
Huh?

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,346
Be careful.

19
00:00:57,246 --> 00:01:00,946
Something just doesn't feel right today.

20
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:17,446
Sizzling hot suspense.

21
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:20,059
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

22
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,846
Rena Mizunashi who sneaks back into the Organization

23
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,746
is ordered to get rid of Akai.

24
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,246
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,946
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,946
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:03,089
"Red and Black Crash: Innocent"

28
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:06,189
"Sunouchi Foreign Talent Production"

29
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,189
What the... FBI?

30
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,171
Are you serious?

31
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,689
This man who has the looks of villain is an agent, you say?

32
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,289
"Camel Andre, age 27" -Yes, there's no need to go through a face check

33
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,181
"Camel Andre, age 27" -in order to become a FBI agent, you see.

34
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,489
But, what brings him to Japan?

35
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,589
You know that I'm here in Japan

36
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,389
because of a mistake I made as an agent of the FBI,

37
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,189
and is quite depressed, don't you?

38
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:31,589
Yes.

39
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,189
That's why he came to check on me,

40
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,589
because I didn't return for quite some time.

41
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:42,589
Andre Camel here is actually my boyfriend, you see.

42
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,689
What...

43
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:47,289
Right, darling?

44
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:50,209
Right? Darling.

45
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,211
Oh, yes...

46
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,089
Not bad.

47
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,789
And why are you still here in Japan?

48
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:00,889
Huh?

49
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,589
And, I think your Japanese has gotten better.

50
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:07,889
Just some time ago you spoke with American accent.

51
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,389
So Andre who's good in Japanese gave me special lessons

52
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:14,989
and I improved really fast.

53
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,689
Now, we're both hesitant to leave Japan.

54
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,239
Right, darling?

55
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,243
Yes, absolutely right.

56
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,589
They somehow look quite awkward.

57
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,589
Well, even if he's with the FBI,

58
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,789
the fact that he's a suspect doesn't change.

59
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,689
You'll have to stay here until all doubts are cleared.

60
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,989
Is that understood?

61
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:36,889
Yes, of course!

62
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,261
Thank you, Conan, for letting me know.

63
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,789
Hey, Jodie.

64
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,289
Before the FBI agents all leave the hospital,

65
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,889
I'd like to go see them one more time.

66
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,289
Okay. Later.

67
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,271
Inspector!

68
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,789
This paper bag was found inside the equipment closet

69
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,789
of the restroom of the top floor restaurant arcade.

70
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:56,889
What?

71
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:02,089
The contents include a raincoat, gloves and a gun.

72
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,283
All things that may have been used to commit the murder.

73
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:08,289
I see, that means even if we check the clothing of the three suspects,

74
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,289
there'll be no gun powder reaction.

75
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,789
Yes, and if the killer disposed of the clothes used during the murder,

76
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,589
he could even get on a crowded elevator if he really wanted to.

77
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,889
Nope, no way.

78
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,789
After committing the murder,

79
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:26,305
the killer used the stairs to go up to the top floor,

80
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,689
then, put the gloves, clothes and gun into the paper bag

81
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,489
and hid the paper bag into the equipment closet, right?

82
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,089
If so, it would've taken him at least five minutes

83
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,315
to get everything done.

84
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:39,789
Rushing to do something like that would make him look suspicious.

85
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,589
And I think the killer didn't expect the officers

86
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:44,589
to arrive here so soon.

87
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,089
True.

88
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:50,689
Oh, and I checked the images on the surveillance camera of the elevator,

89
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,331
but, there were no foreigners riding the elevator.

90
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,333
What about foreigners of Asian descent?

91
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,335
You can't tell just by outward appearance, can you?

92
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,337
Oh, no, I didn't check that closely.

93
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,339
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -I don't think the president

94
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,341
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -would hire any Asian people.

95
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:04,789
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -Because he always used to say,

96
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,189
it's only interesting

97
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,349
when somebody who doesn't look like they can speak Japanese speak it.

98
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,789
So, the suspicious ones...

99
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,355
are those two and him, don't you think?

100
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,689
Then, the most suspicious would be the one

101
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:20,889
who was hiding in the restroom,

102
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,361
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -you, Hal.

103
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:27,389
I... I just told you that I wasn't hiding.

104
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,189
Besides...

105
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,589
if I hid something like that in the restroom,

106
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,389
I wouldn't stick around so long in there.

107
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:35,689
That's true too.

108
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,989
But maybe you saw all the officers

109
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:40,089
and decided to go back and hide.

110
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,689
That's possible too, isn't it?

111
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:42,989
Oh, by the way,

112
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:45,989
the coat was a men's coat for someone of slim physique

113
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,089
and the length would be just right for Toby over there.

114
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,389
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Hey...

115
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,789
if it's that size,

116
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,989
I'm sure that guy who says he's a FBI agent can wear it too

117
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,395
if he forces it on, right?

118
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,789
Moreover, it's not like it has to be limited to us, men.

119
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:01,689
Even the secretary over there can wear it.

120
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,389
What?

121
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,489
Like they say, the greater embraces the less.

122
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:11,489
It's true that if all her testimony up to now were all lies

123
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,089
to cover up her own crime.

124
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,389
Yes, it's probable.

125
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,589
In order to make it look like a crime committed by a man,

126
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,989
she could've deliberately worn a man's coat.

127
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,289
Oh no! I would never do that!

128
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,989
At any rate, it's pretty obvious

129
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,889
that one of you four here fired repeated shots at the president.

130
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,489
Maybe the president was actually eating something.

131
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,789
Huh?

132
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,589
Because look at the president's right hand.

133
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,789
Doesn't it look like he was picking something up?

134
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,589
Now that you mentioned it, yeah.

135
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:50,889
But there's no food on the desk.

136
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,689
Maybe he wasn't eating but holding something.

137
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,457
Right. For example...

138
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,489
A pen or something that was on the desk.

139
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,389
Although very slight, there were blood stains

140
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,489
detected on the tip of the pen and the memo pad.

141
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,289
And on the memo pad, there were very light traces

142
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,889
of something having been written.

143
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:12,989
Don't tell me that...

144
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:15,089
the president wrote something just before he died.

145
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:19,689
And the killer...

146
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,789
If so, please get on with the blood test,

147
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,489
and figure out what was written on the memo pad.

148
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,089
Oh, yes.

149
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,189
Of course, at the same time,

150
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,789
analyze whether it was the president's handwriting.

151
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,589
Yes, okay.

152
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:33,189
I mean, if it were us, we would check for sure.

153
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:34,493
Right, darling?

154
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,389
So, the blood that was found on the memo pad

155
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,289
was Mr. Sunouchi's blood after all.

156
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:49,389
Yes, the handwriting was confirmed to be his writing too.

157
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,489
And, what was written on the memo?

158
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,989
Well... it was written in English.

159
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:57,289
As to the meaning of what was written,

160
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,089
it couldn't have been a dying message.

161
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,889
Bring my tux.

162
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,289
Bring...

163
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,789
Bring my tux.

164
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,189
Please bring...

165
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,289
my tuxedo?

166
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,543
Yes.

167
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:28,547
Continuing this job is too nerve racking.

168
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,549
Yes, it's too painful,

169
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,089
and I can't go on, so I'd like out.

170
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,555
Yes, I'm very sorry.

171
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,289
Goodbye.

172
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,889
Gin.

173
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,573
Kir.

174
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:56,589
Who were you talking to?

175
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,289
On the other end of the line.

176
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,579
Come on.

177
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:03,089
To the personnel at the TV station.

178
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,589
I told them straight

179
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,589
that I can't go on as an announcer anymore,

180
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,289
so that I'd like to quit.

181
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:12,389
I didn't want them coming to look for me either.

182
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,889
Besides I know that the Organization knows what I was talking about

183
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,189
because everything leaks out.

184
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:21,789
I've got a lot of wiretaps and communicators attached to me

185
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:25,789
with two or three people constantly monitoring me.

186
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:32,611
So do you have something you want

187
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,613
with this poor can't roam free girl

188
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,615
who is still being suspected by that person.

189
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,389
I've come to relay a message

190
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,089
from that person who highly suspects you.

191
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,989
Kill a person for me

192
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,389
and let me believe that you're innocent.

193
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,989
It says?

194
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:04,643
Kill?

195
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,189
Who?

196
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:11,189
FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

197
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,989
Shuichi Akai.

198
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:35,501
FBI agent, Akai.

199
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:40,679
I am too, but that person has his doubts too.

200
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,683
That we so easily got you back from the hands of the FBI.

201
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:52,201
I am to relay to you that if you want to prove your innocence,

202
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,701
send the trump of the FBI, Shuichi Akai to the world beyond

203
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,401
with your own hands.

204
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,301
What's up, Kir?

205
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,701
Don't tell me that you can't do it for some reason?

206
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,101
There's no reason or anything.

207
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,901
Gin, even you're having it tough with Akai,

208
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,901
just how do you propose I do it?

209
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,713
If I go out there near the FBI,

210
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,501
I'll get caught again, you know.

211
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,001
You're not going near them.

212
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,101
You're going to lure him into our shooting range.

213
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,801
Give him a sob story like you went back to the Organization,

214
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,727
but you're being treated badly

215
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:32,301
because you goofed and got caught by the FBI.

216
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,733
You feel out of place at the Organization so you want out

217
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,801
and you want him to help you get away and go abroad.

218
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,201
That'll probably be good enough.

219
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:43,201
Of course you're asking him to come alone.

220
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,401
He'll come for sure if you tell him

221
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:48,747
that you'll give him info.

222
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,001
I see.

223
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,751
And when he comes along,

224
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:53,901
you're all going to shoot bullets

225
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,701
and make a beehive out of him?

226
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,757
No, you're sending him off alone.

227
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,501
Huh?

228
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:03,601
He has a sharp nose that is second to none.

229
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,501
If he senses our presence,

230
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:09,601
he'll figure that it's a trap and turn right around.

231
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,301
We're going to be watching everything

232
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:15,101
from a place where his bullets can't reach us.

233
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,401
With the wiretap and camera

234
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,401
that will be set onto you.

235
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,901
Okay.

236
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,301
I'll do as you say,

237
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:24,783
so give me a little time, okay?

238
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,101
No.

239
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:29,101
Now, call him out here right now.

240
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:33,501
If you can't do it,

241
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,901
all I'll do is call Death to come get you.

242
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:40,001
Wait, I hope you don't think that

243
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:43,801
the FBI really talked me into siding with them?

244
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,401
A little of that too,

245
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,601
but according to info that we got from one of our men,

246
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,201
those guys are still at the hospital you were at.

247
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,801
And for some reason,

248
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,601
one of the agents got messed up in an incident,

249
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,501
and the eyes of the FBI are turned in that direction.

250
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,819
We couldn't possibly let this chance slip right by us.

251
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:01,801
What incident?

252
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:06,501
Yeah, a president of a company

253
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,827
somewhere got his body ventilated with air holes.

254
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:09,701
Just an ordinary murder case.

255
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:19,601
Bring my tuxedo to me, please?

256
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,301
You mean that's what was written

257
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,301
on the memo that president wrote?

258
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,843
Yes.

259
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,601
Bring my tux.

260
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:31,601
Bring tux is short for tuxedo.

261
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,001
How baffling.

262
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,301
There are blood stains on the pen and memo paper.

263
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,857
The handwriting is the president's.

264
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:42,001
Moreover, the memo itself is torn off.

265
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,301
Which means...

266
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,301
The president who was shot wrote this down

267
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,865
just before he died.

268
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,601
The killer who notice it,

269
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,901
tore it off and took it away with him.

270
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,801
I can see it to be none other than a dying message though.

271
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,201
No...

272
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,877
Dying message...

273
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:03,601
Oh right, you're both English teachers, aren't you?

274
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:07,901
It's true that I'm teaching English at a prep school,

275
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:11,201
but aren't these people FBI agents?

276
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,601
Oh, right, I had my reasons,

277
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:16,901
and was working as a teacher for a little while.

278
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,897
Right, darling?

279
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,301
Yes, that's right.

280
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,601
By the way, Irina,

281
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,101
do you have any idea

282
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:27,601
as to what this bring me my tuxedo please means?

283
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,701
Oh, yes.

284
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:34,913
I'm pretty sure that the president addressed that message to me.

285
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,601
There's going to be a party tonight,

286
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:40,501
so I think he wanted me to get his tuxedo ready for him by then.

287
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:41,501
What?

288
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,601
Then, you're saying that this was just a plain message,

289
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,201
not connected with the incident at all?

290
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,201
Yes.

291
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,001
Because the president said that he was going to have a meal together

292
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:53,701
with a new talent this afternoon.

293
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,701
He left the message so that I would know about it

294
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,935
when I returned from outside.

295
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:00,301
Which means that you're the one who tore this memo off

296
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,401
and took it with you?

297
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,201
No!

298
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,945
I found the president dead, so I called 110.

299
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,601
I didn't touch anything until the police got here!

300
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,401
But, I knew about the tuxedo,

301
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,701
so I left a message in the voice mail.

302
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,501
Voice mail?

303
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:20,601
So, this is it?

304
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,301
This is Palmer.

305
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,901
President, have you gone out already?

306
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,401
I found the file that you asked me to look for,

307
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,001
so I'll take it over to you.

308
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,401
Oh, and as to the tuxedo you're wearing to tonight's party,

309
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,501
I'll get to it later.

310
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:38,401
It is 1.27pm, Friday.

311
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:39,601
True.

312
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:44,401
Maybe the killer heard this and rushed out of here.

313
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:47,301
Or, in order to make it look that way,

314
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:48,701
maybe she switched the phone to voice mail deliberately

315
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,101
after committing the murder.

316
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,401
What? Oh, no!

317
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,101
It's a possibility.

318
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:58,101
If there's a hidden meaning to bring my tux...

319
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,401
In order to deceive us,

320
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:03,001
maybe you deliberately recorded your message mentioning the tuxedo.

321
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,501
Oh, how cruel.

322
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:06,501
But...

323
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,701
When you say tuxedo, it seems connected with...

324
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:13,301
that man who is working as a model, right?

325
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:16,501
Huh? Hey, wait up.

326
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,601
It's true that the job of a model

327
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:21,301
is to wear all kinds of clothes in a cool way.

328
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,021
But we don't just wear tuxedos, you know.

329
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,501
The president was trying to wear it too.

330
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:30,501
Well... we'll do the investigating,

331
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,101
so please wait in a different room, everyone.

332
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:39,037
Shinichi, did you figure out something from that memo?

333
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:45,401
Maybe he added something on to the memo that was already there

334
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:47,401
and turned it into a dying message?

335
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,801
If so, the forensic officers would've noticed

336
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:52,801
the words that were added on.

337
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,601
Adding or subtracting something to this English statement

338
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,701
doesn't look as if it would indicate something

339
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,501
other than it already looks to be.

340
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:04,101
I wonder if it's appropriate to ask at a time like this,

341
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:07,065
but what happened two years ago?

342
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,801
You mentioned just the other day too,

343
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:13,401
that you came to Japan two years ago.

344
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:16,501
Two years ago is when Shuichi was still at the Organization

345
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,601
doing undercover investigation, right?

346
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:23,081
Then, I'm sure you've heard about the agent who goofed,

347
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,083
and that resulted failure to capture an executive member of theirs.

348
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,501
The agent who goofed back then was me.

349
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:32,801
Yes, it was two years ago.

350
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,601
We staked out at the warehouse

351
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:37,501
where Mr. Akai had made an appointment.

352
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:45,501
An elderly man appeared and sat down on the spot.

353
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,901
Mr. Akai ignored the man,

354
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:51,501
but I carelessly called out to him

355
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:55,113
and said it's dangerous here so leave.

356
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,701
I see,

357
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,501
so that old man was also a member of the Organization

358
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,601
that was supposed to be there?

359
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:02,601
Yes.

360
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:05,123
On top of that the executive never showed up

361
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:08,001
and the fact that Mr. Akai was a FBI agent was also disclosed.

362
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,501
Oh, I remember.

363
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,301
There was a person with his head drooping low

364
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:18,801
among the members who came back to headquarters

365
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,139
after sneaking into the Organization failed.

366
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,401
That's why when Mr. Akai requested someone cut out

367
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,901
for the next strategy...

368
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:29,401
I can handle the driving job!

369
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,601
I'll come to Japan right away!

370
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,401
I was told that I maybe killed.

371
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:40,601
But, my mistake was what caused the death of Mr. Akai's girlfriend.

372
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:45,701
Mr. Akai told me not to worry about it,

373
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,101
because his girlfriend was also ready for what was to come.

374
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,201
A FBI agent?

375
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:57,601
You, Dai?

376
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:01,179
Yeah. I'll be leaving to settle things tomorrow.

377
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,701
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,801
If you're trying to fool me,

379
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:09,187
can't you think of a better lie?

380
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:15,501
That's not surprising at all!

381
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,001
You knew, didn't you?

382
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,301
If you knew, why didn't you stay away from me?

383
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,601
I was using you, you know!

384
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,601
Do I have to tell you how I feel, for you to understand?

385
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:36,701
Akai...

386
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,901
Your phone's been ringing for sometime now.

387
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,401
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,225
-Yes. -It's me.

389
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:51,501
It's me, Rena Mizunashi.

390
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:55,233
Is it okay now? Is there anyone around you?

391
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,235
What...

392
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,601
Yeah, I'm alone.

393
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:02,601
I'll bet you're surprised getting a call from me so soon

394
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,901
after returning to the Organization.

395
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,801
Sort of...

396
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,001
Explain what you mean.

397
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,901
Well, the thing is I don't feel comfortable here.

398
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,201
I want to get out of here, so I want you to help me.

399
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:19,701
Of course I'll give you the information that the FBI wants.

400
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,701
Would it be possible to see you now?

401
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:25,263
Yeah, if you're alone too,

402
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,801
it's okay with me.

403
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,301
I'll send you the time and place later by email, then.

404
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,701
Yeah.

405
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,001
Satisfied?

406
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:37,801
Today is Friday the 13th.

407
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:40,301
I don't believe in things like that to begin with...

408
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,901
But there couldn't be a better day for him to die.

409
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,801
Akai, was that Rena Mizunashi?

410
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:55,601
Yes, she asked me to come meet her now, just the two of us.

411
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:58,301
Just the two of you. It could be a trap.

412
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:00,701
I'd advise you not to go.

413
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:04,501
Yes, but if it's a trap,

414
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:05,701
if I don't go,

415
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,201
there's a ten to one chance that she'll be killed.

416
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,501
That...

417
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,001
I'll be fine.

418
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:15,701
I pride myself for having pretty sharp hunches.

419
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,801
She herself is an agent of the CIA,

420
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,301
I'm sure she's thought up something to make it through this too.

421
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,801
At any rate, let's call Jodie

422
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,701
and think of what we as FBI agents can do.

423
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,601
Akai?

424
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:31,001
What is it?

425
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,680
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,152
A magic chant.

427
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,924
Children's day is next week.

428
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,427
All right...

429
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:10,920
Special limited edition.
