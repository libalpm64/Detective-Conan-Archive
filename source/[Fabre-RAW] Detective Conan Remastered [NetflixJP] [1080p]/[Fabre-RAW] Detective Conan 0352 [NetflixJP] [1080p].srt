1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,430
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,430
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,930
They go off in great spirit for a big catch.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,630
And get caught in an unexpected crime.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,130
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,130
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,330
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,867
Wow! It's fantastic!

9
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,267
What a beautiful lake!

10
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:20,667
Okutani Lake is called the sanctuary of bass fishing.

11
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,867
If things go well, they say you may even be able

12
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,567
to fish one as heavy as 5kg.

13
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,567
5kg?

14
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,867
Okay!

15
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:34,667
I'll eat to my heart's content and we'll win the match!

16
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:40,467
Genta, I think you've got it wrong.

17
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:42,367
No, I don't!

18
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,367
You're talking about the big-eaters contest, right?

19
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,067
Oh my.

20
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,367
Hey.

21
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,167
Ran and I are invited to attend a bass fishing contest

22
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,267
that is sponsored by Sonoko's father's company.

23
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,467
Genta and the others who hear of this

24
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,167
insisted that they wanted to participate in the contest too.

25
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,767
So, here we all are.

26
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:13,567
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 1)"

27
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,267
"Okutani Lake"

28
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,167
Oh, there you are.

29
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,867
Ran!

30
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,167
Sonoko!

31
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,467
Good morning!

32
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:26,867
Good morning!

33
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:31,867
Good morning! Thank you for inviting us here today!

34
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,267
What's this, what's this?

35
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:36,267
You guys know how to say your greetings!

36
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,067
Okay! Give it all you got today, you group of little shrimpies!

37
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,967
Well, I'm so sorry that we're shrimpies!

38
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:45,167
The brat with the glasses is here with you today too!

39
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,867
Well, sorry.

40
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,567
Mr. Mizui!

41
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,167
Sonoko.

42
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,167
What can I do for you?

43
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,867
These children are going to be entering the contest too,

44
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,667
so could you please register them right away?

45
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,767
Yes, all right.

46
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:09,367
Please write your names and addresses here.

47
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,067
This is Mr. Mizui from the head office.

48
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,967
She's my best riend, Ran.

49
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,067
Nice meeting you.

50
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:20,267
Oh! How do you do? I'm Junichi Mizui.

51
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,867
Nice meeting you!

52
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,667
Let's see...

53
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,267
I'm using this!

54
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,467
I'll take this, then.

55
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,567
What about you, Conan?

56
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,067
This one!

57
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,567
That? It looks like a hornworm and is gross.

58
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,067
But, Ayumi, it says here that

59
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:43,167
these soft baits are better for this.

60
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,667
Wow, this is interesting!

61
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,267
See, it looks just like a frog!

62
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,767
I didn't know there was bait like this!

63
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:53,567
Really. It sure looks like a real frog.

64
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,467
Oh, are you guys going to be entering the contest too?

65
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:00,267
Yup, we're going to win for sure.

66
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,567
"Saori Ayukawa (27), Contestant" -Oh, you two sure look strong.

67
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,567
Are you going to enter the contest too?

68
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,667
Of course! I registered long before at the reception desk already.

69
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,467
Don't be too hard on me, okay?

70
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,967
The champion and little fishermen.

71
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:24,567
"Toshihiko Funaki, Freelance Writer" -Thanks for the great picture.

72
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,367
See you guys, good luck.

73
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,067
Yes, we'll need it.

74
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,267
I shook her hand.

75
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:41,067
Maybe I shouldn't take a bath tonight.

76
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,367
Okay, shrimpies!

77
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,967
The contest will start soon.

78
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:49,167
What did you talk about with that woman?

79
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,467
She told us not to be too hard on her.

80
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:54,167
After that, she grabbed my hand firmly.

81
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,567
Ms. Ayukawa talked to you children?

82
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,567
Yeah, firmly, like so...

83
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,067
She sure is beautiful.

84
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:04,367
Do you know that woman?

85
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:09,167
She's the winner of last year's fishing contest.

86
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,467
She's that famous.

87
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,867
Yeah, that person who just came

88
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,867
is the next candidate for winner of this contest

89
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,967
called Takuya Masubuchi.

90
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:21,667
He won the contest the year before last.

91
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,367
The time now is 11:00.

92
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,467
We will be be starting the first day

93
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:31,967
of the Suzuki Cup Okutani Lake Tournament.

94
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:35,467
Please bring the five bass that you have fished

95
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:38,967
to the contest headquarters by 16:00 today.

96
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,267
Okay, let's give it a try!

97
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,967
We'll give it our best shot!

98
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,267
I wonder how this is going to work out.

99
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:56,667
Maybe a boat would've been better after all.

100
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:01,467
Bass are usually hiding where there are algae and fallen trees.

101
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,667
Okay, let's fish here!

102
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,567
Are you sure you know what you're doing, Conan?

103
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,967
Oh, it seems she's going to fish here too.

104
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:15,267
See. Even the candidate for winner thinks this place is the point.

105
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,367
Come on, let's get to it.

106
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,967
Okay, just leave it to me!

107
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,667
No good.

108
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,367
No luck here.

109
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:31,867
Maybe using a boat would've been better, after all?

110
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,767
How're you doing, little ones? Any luck?

111
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:37,367
-Not at all. -None.

112
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,167
I'm from Gekkan Bass, I write articles for this magazine.

113
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,667
My name's Funaki.

114
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,267
And, mind you, it's Bass, not bus.

115
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,567
Give me a break.

116
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,867
We know.

117
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,967
I'm interviewing because I'm going to be writing an article

118
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,167
on this contest next month's edition.

119
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,767
Right! Let me take you pictures and put it in the magazine!

120
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,467
Line up, all of you.

121
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:02,467
Okay, here goes. One plus one is...

122
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,267
You and me!

123
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,867
Ms. Ayukawa seems to be doing good.

124
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,967
I guess I'll go get a picture of her.

125
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:18,067
Hey, if it's not the place that's bad, it must be the lure.

126
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,167
I guess so.

127
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,967
Don't do this.

128
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,667
We're just going to take a look at what kind of lure she's using.

129
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,167
You stay here, Ayumi.

130
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,067
My goodness.

131
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,967
She got all kinds.

132
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,567
This is it! If we could only have this.

133
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,867
I wonder if we can fish with this.

134
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,167
Of course.

135
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,267
No, you can't fish with that!

136
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,167
We're sorry!

137
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,967
Try fishing with this.

138
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,567
This lure...

139
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,467
has a certain smell.

140
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,267
I'm sure you'll be able to fish something.

141
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,967
Thank you so much!

142
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,867
It's being pulled.

143
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:18,667
It's being pulled! Talk about strong!

144
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,667
Mitsuhiko, keep cool.

145
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,467
Cool head! Calm down and wind the reel.

146
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,167
-The other way! -Okay.

147
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,067
Right, that's the way, keep it up!

148
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,867
It's big, heavy, my hands are going numb.

149
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,967
A little more. Wind it slowly.

150
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,067
It's black, a bass! Now! There!

151
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,867
-This is... -This is it?

152
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,767
Oh, my!

153
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,767
Are you all right?

154
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,067
Show it to me.

155
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,867
No big deal.

156
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,567
Let me clean your wound for you.

157
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,067
Does it hurt?

158
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,367
I've got bandage so hold on, okay?

159
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,167
But, before that let's sterilize the wound first.

160
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,367
Okay.

161
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:26,867
Conan, you're late. I was worried about you.

162
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,767
Hurry and get your fish weighed.

163
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,367
What's the matter?

164
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,767
Aren't you feeling well?

165
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:43,167
Don't tell me, you don't have any fish to weigh.

166
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,267
You couldn't fish even one?

167
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:52,867
All four of you? 4 times 0, 0 fish?

168
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,167
Sonoko, don't laugh!

169
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,867
But...

170
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:04,267
We'd like to announce the results for the first day.

171
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:08,167
In first place is Ms. Saori Ayukawa who fished a total of

172
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,767
13524 grams!

173
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,467
All right!

174
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,667
Wow!

175
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,367
We moved places, changed lures.

176
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,567
All that's left is...

177
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:20,967
All that's left is luck! Yup.

178
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,667
Let's turn luck in our direction tomorrow

179
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,567
and aim for a counter win!

180
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,667
Okay!

181
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,667
I wonder if it'll go that well.

182
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,810
Just what are you talking about?

183
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,410
Cut out the stupid talk.

184
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,610
It's nothing to get all worked up over, is it?

185
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,510
Excuse me.

186
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,610
It's really huge, don't you think?

187
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,810
My friend fished it.

188
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,910
The person who fished this is called Mr. Kanie?

189
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,610
Yeah, Mr. Kensuke Kanie.

190
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,310
He was a skilled fisher.

191
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,110
How can you fish a big fish like that?

192
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,410
Because we've been fishing since we were kids.

193
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,610
If you start from now, Ayumi,

194
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,010
I'm sure that by the time you become an adult,

195
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,110
you'll be a great fisherman.

196
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,410
Really?

197
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,310
Maybe I should start right now.

198
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,010
Saori, why did you decide to start fishing?

199
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,210
My father used to fish,

200
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,810
so he used to take me along with him to rivers and lakes

201
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,210
since I was really little.

202
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,310
That's why I never went to amusement parks or zoos

203
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,110
until I entered high school.

204
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,710
What? Poor thing.

205
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,910
Oh, there you are, Ms. Ayukawa.

206
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,710
Wanna drink with me, in advance celebration of your victory?

207
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,510
No, thank you, I'd rather not.

208
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,310
Oh, are you saying that you don't want to drink with me?

209
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,710
Are you sure about that?

210
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,710
Are you sure that's what you really want to say?

211
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,010
I'm just kidding, only joke.

212
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,410
The thing is, I want you to tell me something.

213
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,610
I thought that while I'm here anyway,

214
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,810
I'd go and finish my work on Rail Mania too.

215
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,910
You know almost everything about this place, don't you?

216
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,010
Not really.

217
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,910
Please tell me and help me.

218
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,410
Please, Saori.

219
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,110
Okay.

220
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,910
Oh, that'll be a great help.

221
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,910
I'm indebted to you. Thanks so much.

222
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,610
He said, Rail Mania. I bought that magazine before.

223
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,610
He's a freelance writer,

224
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,010
so he's writing for many different types of magazines.

225
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,710
I see.

226
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,110
Conan, let's fish by boat today.

227
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,010
During this season, I'm sure the bass

228
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,710
are hiding behind things near the shore and waiting for bait.

229
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,110
No matter what your reasoning is,

230
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,410
we were fishing all day near the shore yesterday, and caught nothing!

231
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,810
So, today...

232
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,910
-We're getting on the boat today in order to win. -Right!

233
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,610
I'm going to fish on land after all.

234
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,810
I'm thinking of going some place else today.

235
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,110
Okay, see you then.

236
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,410
What about you, Ayumi?

237
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,010
What should I do?

238
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,610
Oh, Ms. Ayukawa!

239
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,910
Good morning!

240
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,110
Ms. Ayukawa, where are you going to fish today?

241
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,910
I'm planning to Kutanisuji today.

242
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,310
May I go along with you?

243
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,310
It's dangerous there, so I'd rather you don't.

244
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,710
Oh.

245
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,410
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

246
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,810
Good luck, all of you.

247
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,610
Kutanisuji.

248
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,410
Mitsuhiko, let's go there.

249
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,910
Let's take the boat and and beat her to the at Kutanisuji!

250
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,310
Good luck, all of you!

251
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,910
Let's go, Ayumi.

252
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,110
Okay.

253
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,910
Ms. Ayukawa!

254
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,410
Huh? Where?

255
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,910
Oh, true.

256
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,610
Ms. Ayukawa!

257
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,710
I should've gotten on the boat too.

258
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,910
A trolley!

259
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,810
Hello!

260
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,910
What? We hit something.

261
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,510
There was definitely a sound.

262
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,410
What could it be?

263
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,910
Could it be something used when fishing?

264
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,710
I've never seen something like this.

265
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,910
He's Mr. Masubuchi a candidate for champion, right?

266
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,210
Which means, this must be a good place to fish.

267
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,510
But even if the place is good...

268
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,510
Oh, but it's the second day,

269
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,210
I'm sure Conan and the others have fished a lot today.

270
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,910
I wonder.

271
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,810
It's just a little further upstream, right?

272
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,210
What's wrong?

273
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,810
Look, what's that?

274
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,310
I wonder what he's doing.

275
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,610
Maybe he sulked out because he can't catch fish and sleeping.

276
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,510
I doubt it.

277
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,510
What's the matter, Ran?

278
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,110
Conan.

279
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,410
A person is lying on the ground!

280
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,310
Ayumi, wait here, okay?

281
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,310
Oh, okay.

282
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,310
Mr. Funaki.

283
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,910
Kerosene?

284
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,910
If he slipped and hit his head,

285
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,510
there should be blood on the rock.

286
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,110
Search for it!

287
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,010
What is the estimated time of death?

288
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,210
He's still warm.

289
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,010
I'd say it's between 15 to 30 minutes.

290
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,110
He's so scary.

291
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,410
Oh, the ones who found him?

292
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,310
You guys are...

293
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,410
If I remember correctly, you're Smoky Kogoro's...

294
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,610
You mean Sleeping Kogoro.

295
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:11,010
Officer Yokomizo, thank you so much always.

296
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,310
-And, you are? -I'm a junior at Teitan High school,

297
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,910
Sonoko Suzuki.

298
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,310
I'm the presenter of this fishing contest

299
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,110
and here on behalf of the chairman.

300
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,310
Oh, you're the one who thrives on attention,

301
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,910
the daughter of the host of this contest.

302
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,610
Will you explain the conditions when you found him?

303
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,110
Sonoko and I were at the contest headquarters,

304
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,610
but we came walking along to check on Conan and the others,

305
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,510
then, we found Mr. Funaki over there.

306
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,610
So, the victim's name is Funaki?

307
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,610
Yup. He said he was a freelance writer for magazines,

308
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,210
and was saying that he was going to write an article

309
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,610
of this fishing contest for a magazine called Gekkan Bass.

310
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,210
Where were you kids?

311
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,510
I was upstream about 30m from here together with Ayumi and fishing.

312
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,210
When you were there, didn't you hear his scream or something?

313
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,610
Nope.

314
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,710
We didn't, did we?

315
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,910
We didn't hear a thing.

316
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,710
Inspector, may I have a moment with you?

317
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,910
Did you find it?

318
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,510
Well, we searched all over

319
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,710
but didn't come up with anything the victim could've hit his head on.

320
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,710
What? You couldn't find anything?

321
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,910
I was near Otakeiwa between 10:00 to 10:30.

322
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,310
Do you have anyone who can prove that for you?

323
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,310
I was right near him all the time.

324
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,710
Both of us were fishing together from early morning at Otakeiwa.

325
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,810
Where is this Otakeiwa?

326
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,710
Around here.

327
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,510
You may both leave.

328
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,110
Thank you.

329
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,610
Talk about gruff.

330
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,810
Only 30 minutes had past since Mr. Funaki had died.

331
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,710
It takes 20 minutes from the contest headquarters

332
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,610
to where the corpse was found.

333
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,910
Without using a boat, the only way to cross the lake

334
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,510
would be to use the path above the dam.

335
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,610
It would take more than 5 minutes to cross the dam,

336
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,810
so it would've been impossible for anybody

337
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,110
who was on the right side of the lake to commit the crime.

338
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,610
You're Ms. Saori Ayukawa?

339
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,110
Yes, sir.

340
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,210
Oh, are you saying you don't want to drink with me?

341
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,110
Are you sure that's what you want?

342
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,010
Will you please tell me where and what you were doing

343
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,510
between 10:00 and 10:30?

344
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,710
Yes.

345
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,010
I was going up the opposite way to Kutanisuji

346
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,510
from the crossroad of the main trail.

347
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,510
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

348
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,910
We saw her!

349
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,310
We were on the boat,

350
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,010
but we definitely saw Ms. Ayukawa go into Kutanisuji.

351
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,310
Yes, we waved goodbye to her.

352
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,110
-No doubt about it. -Yes.

353
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,310
Okay, you may go back to the contest.

354
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,310
Thank you.

355
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,810
What about us?

356
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,610
You guys can go too!

357
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,110
You don't need proof of our alibi?

358
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,810
No, I don't! I don't have time for kids.

359
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,610
What a surprise.

360
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,610
He's the one who took our picture for us, right?

361
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,510
I wonder if that place is cursed.

362
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,010
Cursed?

363
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,410
Mr. Mizui, just what do you mean by that?

364
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,710
The thing is, half a year ago, somebody died there too.

365
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,810
Since there was no one around back then,

366
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,810
the case closed as an accident.

367
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,610
Who died?

368
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,410
A person called Mr. Kanie,

369
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,810
who was very intimate with Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

370
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,210
Kanie?

371
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,210
Kensuke Kanie, he was a skilled fisher.

372
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,210
Then, he was a candidate for champion too?

373
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,410
Yes. Just like Mr. Masubuchi, he was Ms. Ayukawas's father's student too.

374
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,910
Ms. Ayukawa's father?

375
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,910
He already passed away

376
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,610
but Ms. Ayukawa's father

377
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,910
is the person who spread sports fishing in Japan.

378
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,510
He established a fishing club and taught bass fishing.

379
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,710
Somebody died there 6 months ago.

380
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,810
This is no coincidence.

381
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,910
The murderer is most probably one of the two!

382
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,260
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,400
"Newest model fishing pole"

384
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,320
The fish played peek-a-boo right now.

385
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,700
What a fish ball.

386
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,980
What a fish!
