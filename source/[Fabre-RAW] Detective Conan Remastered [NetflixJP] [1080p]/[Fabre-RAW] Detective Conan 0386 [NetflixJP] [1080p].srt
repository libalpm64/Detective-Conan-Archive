1
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,930
The musical tone of the famed musical instrument brings about murder.

2
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,530
The disaster that befalls a family of musicians.

3
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,030
Suddenly takes an unexpected turn!

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,530
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,230
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,230
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,117
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

8
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:02,217
and went to visit Choichiro Shitara's residence. Pops, Ran and I.

9
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:04,717
Hasuki had called us

10
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,117
because incomprehensible accidents

11
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,717
revolving around the famed musical instrument Stradivarius

12
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:09,917
have been occurring consecutively from the year before last.

13
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,617
Her request was for us to investigate these accidents.

14
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,117
However, as soon as we got there,

15
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,017
the annex went up in flames!

16
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:20,017
Genzaburo who was inside, dies.

17
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:24,817
Who's cigarette butt is this?

18
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:27,517
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

19
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:29,517
That brand is the one...

20
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,217
that Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

21
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,317
Come to think of it,

22
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:36,817
he stopped by here before going to the annex.

23
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,617
If so, then...

24
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,617
this is...

25
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,017
Kid, where do you think you're going?

26
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,917
Just as I thought.

27
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:51,717
This is not an accident, but murder.

28
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:55,017
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,

29
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,717
the next target is...

30
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:04,117
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Interlude!"

31
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,817
What? You mean this fire is arson?

32
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,517
Yes. The cause of the fire is because he fell asleep while smoking,

33
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,017
and the source of the fire is around this ashtray.

34
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,017
But...

35
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:17,917
See, look at this cigarette butt

36
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,017
and this is the cigarette

37
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:23,017
that Genzaburo was smoking back at the main house.

38
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,417
The brand is the same,

39
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,917
and there's nothing odd about it.

40
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,317
There is a trace of it being bitten.

41
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,217
See.

42
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:32,417
Just like you, Pops...

43
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:36,017
People who work and talk while they smoke

44
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,617
have a habit of biting the filter of their cigarette.

45
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:41,417
But there is no trace of this cigarette butt being bitten.

46
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,317
Don't you think it's strange?

47
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:44,917
I see.

48
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:47,917
In order to make it look as if he fell asleep while smoking,

49
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,217
that the killer smoked several cigarettes

50
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:51,817
before setting the place on fire.

51
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,417
That is what you want to say, right?

52
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:02,717
But, the door of this room can only be locked from the inside.

53
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:05,017
How'd the killer leave the room then?

54
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:08,317
You've come across an idea of the kind of trick

55
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,617
that may have been used, right?

56
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,317
Oh no, not yet...

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,817
You're just a kid after all.

58
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,817
He could've just happened to bite the cigarette

59
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,617
that he smoked back at the main house, you know.

60
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:23,817
Besides, Genzaburo used to hate people cleaning up his room.

61
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,917
Despite that, isn't it strange

62
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:29,817
that there isn't even one cigarette filter that has bite traces?

63
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,317
"Benio Tsumagari (54)" -There's nothing strange about it.

64
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,617
"Steward for the Shitara family" -Because Genzaburo

65
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:36,917
used to always throw out the rubbish before going out.

66
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:40,217
But, it's amazing how you dashed out of the room.

67
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:42,317
Well, the fact is, this kid informed me.

68
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,117
But if he threw out the rubbish, it's strange after all,

69
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,917
that he would smoke several cigarettes before falling asleep.

70
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:51,117
You idiot! That's not unusual at all.

71
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:56,017
He probably got sleepy when he was smoking his last cigarette.

72
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,817
That could be it, but...

73
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,217
I wonder if it's okay?

74
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:05,417
This could be a serial murder case.

75
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,217
What?

76
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:08,817
You shouldn't make such an irresponsible remark.

77
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,217
The name...

78
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,817
The initial of the name of the person,

79
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:16,117
Danjiro who died after being attacked by a robber is "D".

80
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,117
The initial of Eimi who died

81
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,817
after falling off the stairs two years ago is "E".

82
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,617
The initial of Furuto who fell off the veranda

83
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:24,917
and died a year ago is "F".

84
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,417
And the initial of Genzaburo who died tonight is "G".

85
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,517
D-E-F-G...

86
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,217
It's in alphabetical order.

87
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:38,217
If what all these people have in common

88
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:42,917
is the birthday of the head of this household, Mr. Choichiro Shitara.

89
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,517
It could be as the kid says.

90
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,617
There's something fishy going on?

91
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,117
Wait!

92
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,917
D-E-F-G...

93
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,917
then the next target is Hasuki with the initial H.

94
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:59,717
Oh no! She shouldn't be left alone!

95
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:04,217
What? I'm the next target?

96
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,817
Oh no, no way.

97
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:08,517
But alphabetically your name is next in line.

98
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:10,317
"Kyosuke Haga (32), Choichiro's nephew" -Now that you mentioned it,

99
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,217
it's true that starting with Father Danjiro's initial D,

100
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,317
it continues E-F-G...

101
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,717
"Hasuki Shitara (23)" -in alphabetical order.

102
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:17,717
"Choichiro's granddaughter" -Come on, it's just a coincidence.

103
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:20,517
I guess so...

104
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:22,317
But, we have a problem.

105
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,617
What about tonight's requiem?

106
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,417
Requiem?

107
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,017
It's been a custom for generations in the Shitara family

108
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:31,817
that when someone passes away, someone plays the requiem.

109
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:34,417
Genzaburo played till last year.

110
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:38,817
Besides, Mr. and Mrs. Shitara is in no condition to play as you can see.

111
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:41,217
I... I can't possibly play either!

112
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:44,817
Okay, I guess I'll play it then.

113
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:47,617
Why don't you all join us too?

114
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,117
A live performance by Kyosuke Haga

115
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,917
is not something you can listen to everyday, you know.

116
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:55,117
But, most of the musical instruments were in the annex.

117
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:58,017
The only instruments left are the piano and that...

118
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,417
Hey, hey, not that Stradivarius,

119
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,017
my hands'll shake.

120
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,117
You can use my violin, then.

121
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:09,117
No, I'll use the one I usually use that's in my car,

122
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:10,517
although it'll never come close

123
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,917
to that famed musical instrument that was made 300 years ago.

124
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,317
It's the only gift that Father ever gave me.

125
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,117
When it comes to tone quality,

126
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:18,317
it's second to none.

127
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,717
I don't want to use that famed musical instrument again

128
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:21,417
and have something happen.

129
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,517
Besides, if I take it out without asking Aunt Ayane,

130
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,017
I think she'll be troubled.

131
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,417
Be troubled?

132
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:35,617
For Mrs. Shitara, that Stradivarius is her son, Furuto himself.

133
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:37,417
That famed musical instrument that Furuto played

134
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,617
in front of Mr. Shitara just before his death is...

135
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:46,117
So, ever since then, at the stroke of midnight...

136
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:54,417
"Ayane Shitara (68), Choichiro's wife"

137
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,917
"Choichiro Shitara (72), The head of the Shitara family"

138
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:06,517
Does Choichiro know about this?

139
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:08,217
Yes, most likely...

140
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:10,117
The storeroom for the Stradivarius

141
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:13,217
is between Grandfather and Grandmother's room.

142
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,317
I'm sure that Grandmother still sees

143
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:22,817
my Father Furuto back then, in her heart.

144
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,817
Then, I shall begin.

145
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:50,617
Composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, "Requiem".

146
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,817
Concerto in D major K-626.

147
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,717
How nice.

148
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:21,517
Yes, Uncle Kyosuke graduated a music university in Germany with honors.

149
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:24,717
Why did he open the window, Kyosuke?

150
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:28,217
Probably so that Grandfather and Grandmother could listen to him play too.

151
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:31,017
Grandmother's bedroom is right above.

152
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,317
You mean that grandmother's room is connected

153
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:44,217
with grandfather's room with the storeroom of the Stradivarius in between?

154
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,117
If locked from the inside,

155
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,017
you cannot go through from the storeroom.

156
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,917
You can go inside from the corridor though,

157
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,617
with the master key that Ms. Tsumagari has.

158
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:55,217
They sleep in different rooms even if they're married.

159
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:58,317
Grandfather is a heavy smoker

160
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:00,117
and Grandmother hated the smoke.

161
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:02,817
He didn't quit until he came down with lung cancer.

162
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:08,217
If Grandfather dies, who's going to receive that expensive violin?

163
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,817
Great Uncle Genzaburo would have...

164
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,517
Maybe Grandmother?

165
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:14,817
I wonder what Grandfather will do.

166
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,917
I feel that it is most appropriate for a musical genius

167
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,917
like Uncle Kyosuke to have it, though.

168
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,617
Conan, listen quietly, will you.

169
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,417
What's that sound?

170
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:06,117
Don't tell me that was?

171
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,460
Grandmother.

172
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,560
Hurry, get an ambulance!

173
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,360
Grandmother's name is Ayane, so her initial is "A".

175
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,760
What does this mean?

176
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,260
I won't give it to anybody.

177
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
It's mine.

178
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,060
Where's the storeroom?

179
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,160
To the right beyond.

180
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,560
Hey.

181
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,960
The door is locked from inside.

182
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,260
And the chair beside the window.

183
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,560
Could it be suicide after all?

184
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,260
Well, well...

185
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,160
Mr. Mouri, another encounter with Death.

186
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Come on. It's mere coincidence.

187
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,460
Inspector, and besides it's the saga of renown detectives,

188
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,860
to become involved in cases like these no matter where they go.

189
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,260
Then, I'd rather you stay still at home.

190
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,560
The estimated time of the incident is around midnight.

191
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,360
The site is that window on the 3rd floor.

192
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,260
It seems to be her bedroom.

193
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,260
Where were you at that time?

194
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,560
Yes, sir. I was in the room right below with everyone else

195
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,260
listening to Kyosuke playing the Requiem.

196
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,860
Requiem?

197
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,360
Yes, it seems to have been a custom handed down

198
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
for generations at the Shitara residence.

199
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,760
Genzaburo, who burned to death

200
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,960
was the youngest of 3 brothers.

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,660
The oldest is Choichiro.

202
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,360
The 2nd son Danjiro, who died 30 years ago

203
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,560
is Kyosuke's father.

204
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,160
So, famed detective,

205
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
what do you think her motive for suicide was?

206
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,260
Oh, well, as to that... I have no idea yet.

207
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,760
I think it's the violin.

208
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,660
She's the steward for the Shitara family.

209
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,060
Let's go to Mrs. Shitara's room.

210
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
This is...

211
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Straduvarius.

212
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,360
Don't tell me that a robber broke in

213
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,460
and Ayane fell out the window accidentally.

214
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,460
But this room was locked.

215
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,960
There are no signs of any struggling either.

216
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,960
There are no signs of anyone having come in here either.

217
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,460
The violin was probably already broken by someone

218
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,260
before Mrs. Shitara opened the case.

219
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,860
Maybe it was from that shock.

220
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,260
But, would she do something like that

221
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,560
-just because a musical instrument broke... -Don't you know,

222
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,060
that violin is a legendary violin that costs several billions of yen!

223
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,560
Moreover, Ayane was cherishing it

224
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,860
as if it were the double of her son, who died.

225
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,360
If someone broke it,

226
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm pretty sure that she'd feel like jumping out the window.

227
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,160
-Wrong. -What?

228
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,060
I think she broke it herself.

229
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,860
Not again, this brat...

230
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,660
By herself? What makes you think so?

231
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,860
See, look at the new scratch on that table.

232
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,760
Grandmother probably threw this violin against it.

233
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,560
You idiot! She's not like Inspector Megure

234
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,860
who knows nothing of violins you know.

235
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,460
She would never do something like that!

236
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,560
Yes, I think so too.

237
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
But, that's only if this violin is genuine.

238
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,260
What?

239
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,860
Look at the label that is stuck to the inside of the violin.

240
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,760
The mark says "G.A"

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,360
If Antonio Stradivari made it,

242
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,960
the label should show "A.S"!

243
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,260
How come you know something like that?

244
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Shinichi told me so some time ago.

245
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
You mean that detective kid?

246
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,460
Come to think of it, Shinichi was really knowledgeable

247
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,560
when it came to violins.

248
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,960
Maybe because Holmes used to play it?

249
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,260
Then, what does "G.A" stand for?

250
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,960
The violin maker who made that violin

251
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,760
was just being playful and put his initial on the mark

252
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,960
that was a replica of the real one.

253
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,160
The replica is also famous

254
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
and a large amount had been made since some time ago.

255
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,860
See, underneath the label,

256
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,860
it says "Made In Germany".

257
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,660
It's a 100% replica.

258
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
He's...

259
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,960
Kyosuke that I mentioned a while ago.

260
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,060
Can you tell me who was listening to his Requiem in the room below?

261
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,960
Yes, sir, Ran and I,

262
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
that kid over there,

263
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,160
Hasuki, and the steward, Ms. Tsumagari, all four of us.

264
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,460
And Ayane fell to her death during this performance.

265
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,560
But, why did Grandmother have to commit suicide,

266
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,060
after Uncle Kyosuke risked his life to save her from the flames?

267
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,060
Save her?

268
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Yes, Kyosuke and Conan saved Ayane

269
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
who didn't make it in time out of the fire.

270
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,760
I still don't understand.

271
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,160
Why did she break the replica?

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Don't tell me she thought it was genuine all this time

273
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,860
but realized only now that it was a replica.

274
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,760
That's isn't possible.

275
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,160
Mr. Shitara's violin has been appraised

276
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,460
and is guaranteed to be genuine.

277
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,460
But, this case is genuine.

278
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Isn't this the one?

279
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,360
Grandfather.

280
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,460
It was hidden behind the bed.

281
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,560
That Ayane, she dare treat it so carelessly.

282
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,060
It has the label of Antonio Stradivari.

283
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,460
So this is genuine.

284
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,760
When I saw it I knew it was.

285
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,560
Would you like me to play it?

286
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,360
No, that won't be necessary if you say so.

287
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,760
What we see is good enough.

288
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,460
If so, what on earth is that?

289
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,860
Maybe another Stradivarius was placed here to surprise everyone.

290
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,060
But, after finding out that it was a replica, she was shocked and...

291
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,560
I see, so before her husband finds out

292
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,860
that she spent a lot of money on trash,

293
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,360
she committed suicide.

294
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
If so, everything falls into place.

295
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,060
Wrong!

296
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,260
When I came into this room a while ago,

297
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,660
I checked the bed but nothing was there!

298
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,760
I'm sure that someone...

299
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,460
came to secretly replace the replica that was once exchanged

300
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
for the genuine Stradivarius,

301
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,160
again with the genuine one.

302
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,360
Somebody for some reason came into this room

303
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,660
-after I did and... -Conan

304
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,460
Maybe you should check the fingerprints that are on it.

305
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,660
Well, I'm sure you'll find fingerprints everywhere though.

306
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,460
Mine too, all over the place.

307
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,360
Because I was tuning the Stradivarius

308
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,260
in preparation for Uncle Choichiro's birthday since yesterday afternoon.

309
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,860
-In this room? -Yes, sir.

310
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,260
I handed it over to Hasuki after that, right?

311
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,360
Yes, I played it a little too,

312
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,860
so my fingerprints are also on it...

313
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,360
Was there anyone else there back then?

314
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,760
I was alone.

315
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,160
Uncle Kyosuke left taking Grandmother with him to the garden,

316
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,260
so that she wouldn't bother me.

317
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,160
I was showing Mr. Mouri the Stradivarius

318
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,260
when he arrived a while later

319
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,560
then we saw the annex on fire.

320
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,060
In the meantime, I took the Stradivarius that was left as is on the table,

321
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,760
to the storeroom.

322
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,960
Which means, anyone of you could've switched the violin.

323
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,060
But, Inspector, that doesn't matter now, does it?

324
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
The genuine one is back

325
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,960
and that kid over there is just saying what he wishes.

326
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,460
But, something's strange about this incident!

327
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,860
What's so strange! This room was locked,

328
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,960
and the door of that storeroom was locked too.

329
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,760
Moreover, there is a chair by the window.

330
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,260
No matter how you look at it, it's suicide!

331
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,460
Where's the spare key to this room?

332
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
Other than what Mrs. Shitara was using,

333
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,560
I have the master key.

334
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,260
Inspector, I found the key among the belongings of the corpse.

335
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,660
-I see. -See, this is not a serial murder case!

336
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,460
Serial murder?

337
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,260
Well, according to this kid,

338
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,460
he says that the killings started 30 years ago

339
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,260
with the initial of the names of the members of the family,

340
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,960
D-E-F-G in alphabetical order.

341
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,960
But, after the letter "G" of Genzaburo who died in the fire.

342
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Ayane, with the initial "A" committed suicide.

343
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,360
That is, there was no connection.

344
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,360
-Maybe it's the musical scale? -What?

345
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,260
D-E-F-G-A.

346
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,760
In Italian it would be Do-Re-Mi,

347
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,960
but in English it is C-D-E-F-G-A-B.

348
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
Like they say the "C" chord.

349
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
I see.

350
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,160
Which means that the next alphabet would be "B".

351
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
But, who has the initial "B"...

352
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,260
Benio Tsumagari

353
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,060
You mean the next target is I?

354
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,960
Come to think of it, 30 years ago,

355
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,260
when I first started working here,

356
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,460
Mr. Shitara mentioned,

357
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,160
"If you belonged to our family,

358
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,760
we could go right up the scale from C to B"

359
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,560
I see, since Choichiro starts with a "C",

360
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,160
that'll make C-D-E-F-G-A-B,

361
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,260
the entire musical scale.

362
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,560
I wonder if I said something like that.

363
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Well, I'd like you all to wait inside your rooms for now, then.

364
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,260
Inspector, they're her footprints.

365
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,360
From the looks of it,

366
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,960
it seems she jumped down without a tinge of hesitation.

367
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Without a tinge of hesitation?

368
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,360
Inspector, I'm sure that it's suicide after all.

369
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,960
I mean this room was locked.

370
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,860
Locked...

371
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Come to think of it,

372
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,060
the room that Genzaburo burned to death in was also locked.

373
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,760
Before the fire, everyone was at the annex,

374
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,260
so the anyone of the four could've set fire to it.

375
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,460
But this room was also locked.

376
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,060
I'm sure there's something to it.

377
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,660
What's that?

378
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,760
See by the top of the window,

379
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,860
there's something transparent. That square thing.

380
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,960
Is it a scotch tape or something?

381
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,760
There is the same to the right too.

382
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,760
Mr. Mouri was asking

383
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,560
if you saw anything strange near the corpse.

384
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,460
Come to think of it...

385
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
And one more thing.

386
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,660
There was something that looked like the tip of a chopstick

387
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,060
Yeah, we found something that looked to be the burnt remains of a case.

388
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,360
Right, shaped something like this,

389
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,960
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it.

390
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Which means that there was nothing in the case, right?

391
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,460
Right, if that is used,

392
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,960
it would be possible to kill Ayane.

393
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,060
The only thing left to solve is the locked room mystery.

394
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,760
I see, so that's the story.

395
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
But, there is one thing I don't understand...

396
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,760
What is the killer so hung up on?

397
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,987
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:35,887
"Perfect pitch"

399
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:38,687
You've got to watch Conan's perfect pitching.

400
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,687
What a play on words.
