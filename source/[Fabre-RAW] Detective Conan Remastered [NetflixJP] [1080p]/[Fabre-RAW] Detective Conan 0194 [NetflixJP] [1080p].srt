1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,840
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,640
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,140
That unforgettable melody

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,940
brought us an unusual case.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,490
I get involved in a case

10
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,490
and end up getting hurt.

11
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,890
The blood transfusion from Ran saves me.

12
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,990
But Ran has guessed who I really am.

13
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,090
An antidote Haibara makes for me

14
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,190
changes me back into Shinichi,

15
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,390
and then she disguises herself to look like Conan

16
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,090
so that Ran's suspicions will vanish.

17
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,390
Please.

18
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,390
I need just a little more time.

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,790
She...

20
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,690
she's waiting for me.

21
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,590
I can't turn into Conan again now... not yet.

22
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,090
Haibara? You...

23
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,690
Why...

24
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,390
24 minutes over time.

25
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,190
I guess that's the maximum tolerance level.

26
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,290
I'll consider this a loan.

27
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,790
Edogawa.

28
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,090
"The Entrusted Music Box (Part 1)"

29
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,990
What is it?

30
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,090
The antidote for the APTX4869.

31
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,390
You still have some, don't you?

32
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,790
May I have some?

33
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,290
Not on your life.

34
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,590
I wouldn't think of giving you any,

35
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,290
not with your habit of unthinkingly getting involved

36
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,490
with any dangerous crime you come across.

37
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,190
Forget about it.

38
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,390
Well, let me apologize then.

39
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,890
I'll try to be more careful next time.

40
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,190
I already told you. That was a trial drug.

41
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,190
I can't go around administering unperfected drugs.

42
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,690
You could really die from it next time.

43
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,690
I guess you can't come up with the real thing

44
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,190
using only the ingredients for paikal (a Chinese liquor).

45
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,990
Yes, if only we had the data for the real drug.

46
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,390
Oh well, you should just be grateful she fell for our ruse

47
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,890
and count your blessings.

48
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,990
Oh, rats. If I'd known it was going to turn out like this,

49
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,890
I should have just told her what I intended to.

50
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,190
It's Doctor Agasa.

51
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,390
Conan, are you sure you won't come?

52
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,190
We're going to the city's indoor pool.

53
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,590
It has a wave making machine, it's really cool.

54
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,190
Sorry, I've still got a cold.

55
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,290
See you later.

56
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,790
Haibara, you're in a good mood.

57
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,390
I bet something nice happened to you.

58
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,090
Yeah, the school lunch today was curry.

59
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,690
She's not you, Genta.

60
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,990
Well, here we go all over again.

61
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,890
"Mouri Detective Agency"

62
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,790
Good grief...

63
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,690
and it's already summer.

64
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,790
I guess spring won't be entering my life for a long time.

65
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,090
Huh? I know this song.

66
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,490
It's "Haru yo Koi"?

67
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,690
I'm back.

68
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,890
Hi, Conan, welcome home.

69
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,490
Why I didn't know you had a son too?

70
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,190
I don't, I'm just taking care of this kid and...

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,890
What's wrong with this music box?

72
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,290
It sounds like it's skipping a few keys here and there.

73
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,690
This is none of your business.

74
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,990
How old are you, son?

75
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,090
I'm 7 years old.

76
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,390
He's in the 1st grade but he's very perceptive

77
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,890
and he's a big help when it come to solving crimes.

78
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,090
I see.

79
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,490
I guess that makes you a little detective, doesn't it?

80
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,190
Oh, that's right. Why don't you tell Conan about it?

81
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,790
Maybe he'll be able to help finding

82
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,790
the person Haruna is looking for.

83
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,490
She's looking for someone?

84
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,190
The truth is...

85
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,790
A bell friend?

86
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,990
You're looking for a pocket bell (beeper) friend?

87
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,490
Yes, that's right. His name is Shugo.

88
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,590
We met 3 years ago.

89
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,890
I came to Tokyo around then to attend an art university.

90
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,790
I had a hard time making friends and I was very lonely,

91
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,390
so I started pressing numbers at random on my pocket bell

92
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,390
and sent messages saying, "My name is Haruna,

93
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,890
will you be my friend?"

94
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,790
And who would have imagined.

95
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,690
I got a reply saying "My first girlfriend's name was Haruna.

96
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,590
This must be fate, let's be friends".

97
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,890
We've been bell friends ever since.

98
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,190
He seemed like such a nice old man

99
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,990
that I could confide all my secrets to.

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,690
Then if you send a message with your pocket bell

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,690
that you want to see him, won't he come?

102
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,290
That's no longer possible.

103
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,190
You see, his pocket bell is here with me.

104
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,290
It was last Christmas.

105
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,690
I'd been working part-time to pay for my tuition

106
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,090
but it was hard making ends meet

107
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,090
so I'd decided to quit school and go back home,

108
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,190
so I figured that before I left, I'd meet him just once

109
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,990
so we decided to meet in front of the Hachiko statue

110
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,690
at the Shibuya station.

111
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,690
I waited for a long time,

112
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,190
but no one fitting his description appeared.

113
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,690
And just when I decided to give up and leave.

114
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,890
I looked inside and found his pocket bell

115
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,290
along with this music box

116
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,890
But how did you know, that was his pocket bell?

117
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,290
There was a message on that pocket bell,

118
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,190
it said, "This music box is worth a lot of money,

119
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,590
please use it to pay for your tuition

120
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,890
and don't give up your dreams, Haruna"

121
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,190
I couldn't very well

122
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,690
accept such an expensive present, how could I?

123
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,090
That's why I thought I'd have it looked at

124
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,190
and maybe the owner could be found, then I could give it back.

125
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,990
I took it to an antique shop.

126
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,390
But the antique dealer said

127
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,090
it was just an old, broken music box.

128
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,690
And I've started getting strange messages on my pocket bell.

129
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,190
Strange messages?

130
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,990
It said, "I have something to ask you.

131
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,490
Meet me at the place I've indicated, come alone."

132
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,290
And then? Did you go?

133
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,990
No, because the tone just wasn't Shugo's style.

134
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,890
It scared me somehow, that's why I didn't go.

135
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,690
Later that night though, I got messages reading,

136
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,990
"Thief", more than 10 of them.

137
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,590
More than 10?

138
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,190
Thief, eh? Do you know what it mean?

139
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,690
No, and there was no way to contact the sender

140
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,390
to ask what it meant.

141
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,090
I thought it might have something to do with Shugo,

142
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,290
that's why I came to you for help.

143
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,690
And are you still getting those messages?

144
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,390
No, they kept coming for some time but not anymore.

145
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,090
That means this music box is our only clue.

146
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,290
But what can an off tune music box possibly tell us?

147
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,690
I don't think it's a lost cause...

148
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,590
Here, look.

149
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,190
The pins on the drum of this music box are broken.

150
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,590
And it doesn't look like they broke off naturally because of long use,

151
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,790
it looks like they were deliberately twisted

152
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,790
and broken off, doesn't it?

153
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,390
-You're right. -It could be some kind of message.

154
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,890
It's possible. The song is, "Haru yo Koi"

155
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,190
and the missing notes are the la, do and la at the end.

156
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,290
Ladola? It sounds like some kind of monster.

157
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,190
Do you know the words for the missing parts?

158
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,390
Let's see, that part of the song goes,

159
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,290
"Onmo e detai to matte iru"...

160
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,990
Which means the missing parts are 'mo' and 'de' and 'ru'.

161
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,190
'Mo de ru'?

162
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,190
Model. Shugo's a model.

163
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,690
Now that we know that much,

164
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,590
we can ask around all the model agencies.

165
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,390
That won't be necessary,

166
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,790
it'll be faster if we go talk to him personally.

167
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,790
Stupid, she can't do that, that's why she's here.

168
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,590
But you have the number for his pocket bell, don't you?

169
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,490
Then you can explain the situation to Officer Takagi

170
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,590
and have him contact the pocket bell company.

171
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
I'm sure we'll be able to get an address.

172
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,190
Way to go, Conan.

173
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,090
We've got the address and the telephone number.

174
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,190
You could be smarter than Shinichi.

175
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,590
Not, really. Officer Takagi did the work.

176
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,390
That's what I call abusing his authority.

177
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,890
By the way, Haruna,

178
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,990
are you sure he said you could visit him?

179
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,890
Yes, but I don't think

180
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,790
he was the one who answered the phone.

181
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,890
Everyone in his family seemed to know

182
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,490
he was very much into pocket bell communication.

183
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,190
So when I told them that,

184
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,390
I wanted to return the pocket bell and music box

185
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,090
I was keeping for him,

186
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,290
I was told to come by anytime.

187
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,090
I'm really looking forward to meeting him.

188
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,690
Yes, so am I.

189
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,390
Excuse me. It's me, Haruna.

190
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,690
Yes. Please come in.

191
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,390
"Kazuko Ogata (50), Tsuneo's wife" -Oh my,

192
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,490
you've brought friends along.

193
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,590
I guess you could say we're her escorts.

194
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,190
Mother, we can talk about that later.

195
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,390
Shiro.

196
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,690
The infamous "Haruna" has come to pay us a visit.

197
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,490
Let's have her relax in her room for a while.

198
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,590
After all, she was such a comfort to our grandfather.

199
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,890
Your grandfather?

200
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,290
That's right.

201
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,790
But first, why don't you offer him some incense?

202
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,190
Did she say incense?

203
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,890
You don't think...

204
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,890
Did he pass away?

205
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,490
Yes, very suddenly at the end of last year.

206
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,690
That's terrible.

207
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,190
Did he do any modeling?

208
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,790
-What? -I guess not.

209
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,690
By the way, about the music box you got from my father...

210
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,590
Yes, this is it. Here you are.

211
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,790
I understand it's worth a lot of money

212
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,490
so I'd like to return it.

213
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,390
That's very kind of you.

214
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,890
Why... this tune...

215
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,890
Haru yo Koi?

216
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,990
You...

217
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,990
It's the song mother often played on the harp.

218
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,190
"Tsuneo Ogata (53), Current Ogata family head"

219
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,490
Mother? The woman in the photo?

220
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,090
That's right, that's my mother Haruna next to father's photo,

221
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,190
she died 3 years ago.

222
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,290
-Haruna? -3 years ago?

223
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,390
I think you reminded my grandfather of our late grandmother.

224
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,590
He was very happy,

225
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,790
he told everyone Haruna had come back.

226
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,690
I realize this is rude, but isn't it rather unusual

227
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,690
for a man his age to be using a pocket bell?

228
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,190
Not at all.

229
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,790
After mother died, father began to taking late night walks.

230
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,990
We made him carry one along because we were worried about him.

231
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,590
By the way...

232
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,490
Was there anything in the music box?

233
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,790
Like what?

234
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,590
Well, for instance...

235
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,090
Stamps.

236
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,690
"Minoru Ogata (25), Ogata family eldest son" -A set of four,

237
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,890
they're hand carved and worth about 200 million yen.

238
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,290
Minoru.

239
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,990
There's only one reason for you to come all the way here,

240
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,790
grandfather told you where he hid it

241
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,390
and you're here to look for it, aren't you?

242
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,990
That's not why I'm here.

243
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,590
Oh, never mind. You'll show your true colors eventually.

244
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,190
You just relax and have a nice stay, Haruna.

245
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,090
Good grief. Don't mind him.

246
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,390
He's just irritated because his company's not doing too good.

247
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,390
We appreciate you coming here today,

248
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,090
why don't you join us for dinner?

249
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,290
We'd like to hear about dad from you.

250
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
I wonder what that guy meant about stamps

251
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,390
worth 200 million yen

252
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,690
and I wonder what those missing keys on the music box mean.

253
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,290
What does it mean?

254
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,980
All those questions... during dinner.

255
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,080
Poor Haruna, I feel sorry for her.

256
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,480
And on top of that, it starts to pour

257
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,580
so we end up having to spend the night.

258
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,880
Hey, don't you think this is weird?

259
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
Yes, everyone in this family

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,280
except for Shiro the second son is weird.

261
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,680
That's not what I meant.

262
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,380
Look at that, behind Shugo's mortuary tablet.

263
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,480
It says he died on December 6th.

264
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,480
So, what about it?

265
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,580
Well, Haruna said she got the music box

266
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,080
last year at Christmas.

267
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,780
Which means, if Haruna is telling the truth,

268
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,880
then it wasn't Shugo that gave it to her,

269
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
it must have been someone else, right?

270
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,580
Let's just forget all about the unpleasantness

271
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,780
and get some sleep.

272
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,980
All right.

273
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,280
Hey, what's the matter, Ran?

274
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,180
An... an old man with a cane

275
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,280
just walked down the corridor and went to the left!

276
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,680
Who's there?

277
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
There's nobody out there.

278
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,680
But I'm positive I saw him go left.

279
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,780
But that's where I'm sleeping.

280
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,880
What's wrong?

281
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,880
Has something happened?

282
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,380
It's nothing, my daughter thought

283
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,680
she saw a strange shadow of someone.

284
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,180
Someone's shadow?

285
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,980
I think their imagination got the best of them.

286
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,680
It wasn't our imagination.

287
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Didn't the guest who stayed with us the last time

288
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,280
say they thought they felt someone walk past their pillow

289
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,680
when they were asleep?

290
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,180
You mean it happened before?

291
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,480
Well, yes.

292
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,680
But we should be the only ones here tonight.

293
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
By the way, where's Minoru?

294
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Probably in the bath.

295
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,380
Good grief, now what?

296
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,180
It sounded like a bowstring breaking.

297
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,180
You don't think it's from the room where mother keeps her koto?

298
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,780
Let's go and have a look.

299
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,480
Hey, wait for us!

300
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,480
Minoru...

301
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,980
Hang in there, Minoru. Minoru.

302
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,680
Minoru, wake up.

303
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,980
Hang on, Minoru.

304
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,280
-It's impossible. -What's wrong, Haruna?

305
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
Haruna.

306
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,280
I don't believe it.

307
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,080
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"?

308
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
What?

309
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,180
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"

310
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,180
Do you suppose this means that old man's shadow we just saw

311
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,580
as well as what just happened is all the work of Shugo,

312
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,280
the man who died last year...

313
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,180
You idiot! Once a person dies, they can't do anything.

314
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Instead of wasting time making silly deductions,

315
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,380
get on the phone and call the police.

316
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,680
This could be a murder case.

317
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,380
Hey, wait.

318
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,780
Don't go killing me off.

319
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,980
Minoru.

320
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,180
Minoru, what in the world happened?

321
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,280
How should I know?

322
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,480
Somebody came out of nowhere

323
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,680
and hit me on the head with something hard.

324
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,380
Something hard? You mean that koto?

325
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,880
Probably.

326
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,580
Isn't that koto the one grandmother loved the most?

327
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,280
Haruna, don't tell me you were the one who hit me.

328
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,180
I would never.

329
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,580
You're wrong.

330
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,480
When we heard the loud noise, we were all in Ran's room.

331
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,780
Right?

332
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,080
Yeah, that's right.

333
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,280
Then who did it?

334
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,580
Why are you asking? You saw who hit you, didn't you?

335
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,880
-What? -See, you were hit on the forehead.

336
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,680
That means you were hit from the front, right?

337
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,580
It was so dark, I couldn't see anything.

338
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,680
You mean this room was dark too, when you got hit?

339
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,780
That's right. When I heard a strange noise

340
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,980
and felt someone's presence in the dark,

341
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,680
it was too late.

342
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,380
But, isn't that strange?

343
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,980
What do you mean?

344
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,180
What were you doing all by yourself in the dark?

345
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,380
Well?

346
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,980
I, uh...

347
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,380
Minoru.

348
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,580
Minoru?

349
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,780
You idiot. I'm sure Minoru came into this room

350
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,480
because he could feel someone's presence.

351
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,280
And just when he was about to turn the lights on,

352
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,680
that person hit him with the koto.

353
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,280
Isn't that right, Minoru?

354
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,180
Yes. I guess.

355
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,780
Then dad,

356
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,480
what about the message on Haruna's pocket bell?

357
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,380
Oh, that. That's probably from one of her friends.

358
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,680
A friend?

359
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,080
You had probably promised to meet a friend tonight

360
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,180
but you forgot all about it and came here,

361
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,280
and so that message, "I was waiting for you"

362
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,280
was probably from your friend complaining.

363
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,480
Am I wrong, Haruna?

364
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes. I don't remember making any such promise.

365
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,280
Eh?

366
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,380
Yes, well, a lot has happened to you today,

367
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,080
I don't blame you for forgetting.

368
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,680
Then what about the old man's shadow I saw?

369
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
-Oh, that... -Maybe...

370
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,980
that's who attacked my brother.

371
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,180
I don't think an old man with a cane

372
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,280
could lift a koto as heavy as that and knock someone out.

373
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
You're absolutely right.

374
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,980
Even if that old man did exist,

375
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,780
he wouldn't have been able to knock Minoru unconscious.

376
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,280
Besides, the old man Ran saw

377
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,180
was heading toward the end of the corridor

378
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,380
and even if he tried to hide in the room at the end,

379
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,480
that's where Conan and I were sleeping.

380
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,180
Are you saying...

381
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,580
That old man was probably...

382
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,580
Probably...

383
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,480
Just your imagination.

384
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,980
What?

385
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,280
As people used to say,

386
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,380
"Ghosts are usually withered eulalia grass."

387
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,080
Wait just one minute. I really saw the old man.

388
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,380
You're so scared of seeing ghosts,

389
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,780
that's why you imagined seeing one.

390
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,480
Dad.

391
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Anyway, ma'am, you'd better call the police.

392
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
There's one thing we can be sure of,

393
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,280
someone else besides us is in this house.

394
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Yes, right away.

395
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,380
Could Pops be right,

396
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,280
is somebody hiding somewhere in this house?

397
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,380
If there is, what do they want?

398
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,580
By the looks of the room, nothing seems to have been touched.

399
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,080
So whoever it is, Minoru is the target.

400
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,280
But this isn't his room

401
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,880
and I have a pretty good idea what he was doing here

402
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,780
in the dark room.

403
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:52,280
But I wonder how and when the attacker found out about it?

404
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,180
And about the koto used as the weapon.

405
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,780
Did the attacker have a reason for picking

406
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,880
the koto as the weapon?

407
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,780
Rats. There's so many unanswered questions.

408
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,280
The shadow of the old man Ran saw is another mystery.

409
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,480
Was it really just her imagination?

410
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,980
And the last mystery is...

411
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,280
the off tune music box.

412
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,480
I'm positive the music box

413
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,480
is the key to a very important secret.

414
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,480
It'll tell us where the very thing everyone in this household

415
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,980
is searching for, is...

416
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,380
It'll tell us where the stamps worth 200 million is hidden.

417
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,300
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,140
"Fan"
