A strong heart along with deduction and power.

And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,190
Today's case is a special one with tricks.

4
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,090
It is a large scaled, fun-packed episode.

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,630
the goddess of Mountain Tenbu,

12
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,130
was worshipped by the villagers,

13
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,230
and protected the peace of the village.

14
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,130
However, those who enraged the goddess

15
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,130
died a ruthless death.

16
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,530
So, it has been told!

17
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,730
What a dreadful thing to do,

18
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,830
digging a tunnel through the rocky mountain

19
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,630
where the goddess stands.

are sure to fall upon them!

22
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,030
That must be the statue of the goddess?

23
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,230
Right!

24
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,330
And that hideous ropeway is in clear view, too.

Well, we're not all that sure...

Hi! Nice to meet you, Conan.

to attend the opening ceremony tomorrow.

No problem, Ms. Bunny.

45
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,930
There are people who are against the ropeway, I see.

46
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,230
It seems that you not only called me

47
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,830
to attend the ceremony, am I right?

48
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,130
Yes, the president will tell you more about it.

why we've asked you to come, Mr. Mouri.

There are many who are against the opening of the ropeway,

58
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,630
so you'd like to see to it that the ceremony proceeds safely, right?

"Junpei Doumoto (30)" -Just as expected of you.

The only ones who are happy about it

are the local shop owners and those who will gain profit from it.

62
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,630
Since the way my father does things is very aggressive,

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,130
he has a lot of enemies.

64
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,930
That's why I went independent at an early age,

65
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,530
and started an import and export business handling miscellaneous goods.

66
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,030
And since your business is not doing well,

67

didn't you come ask dad for financial help again today?

68

What?

69
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,730
I'm home! Long time no see, dad!

70
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,530
Did you just arrive here from Tokyo?

71
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,230
Yes! It's a grand event for you after all.

Oh, come on.

74

After leaving home, you went

75

and did what you wanted to do to your heart's content

"Tourist business" my eye! After all the snickering and bickering over it.

81

Stop it! By the way, Rina, who is he?

82
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,530
He is Tetsuya Aoyagi, a freelance journalist.

83
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,130
He says he'd like to write an article about this.

as to the opening of the ropeway from Rina.

87
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,330
I hear a lot of things happened

88

when the tunnel was under construction.

89
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,230
Are you Mr. Aoyagi?

90
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,830
I see, so you're the one trying to get it going good with Rina, right?

91
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,530
Yes, I believe I talked to you over the phone.

92
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,130
Just a second, what is this about?

93
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,030
I wonder if he has something he doesn't want others to know about.

94
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,130
Vice president,

95
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,130
what do you say we have Mr. Mouri and his party

96
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,930
test ride the ropeway in preparation for tomorrow's ceremony?

97
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,330
Oh, that sounds good. Let's do that!

98
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,030
Let's have you take a look at the splendid landscape from the terminal

99
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,330
at the top of the mountain which is the pride and joy of Doumoto Tours.

100
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,530
That sounds just great.

101
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,130
Oh, come to think of it Pops is...

102
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,630
One sheep, two sheep...

103
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,430
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me you can't take high places?

104
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,030
I'm fine, so long as I don't look below.

105
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,430
How nice.

106
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,830
It is about 3,000 meters to the summit,

107
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,130
and we'll be there in about 10 minutes.

108
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,330
What's that?

109
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,930
It's an esplanade.

110
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,030
It's closed until we open it to the public.

111
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,230
After going to the summit with the ropeway,

112
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,730
everyone will be walking back down

113
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,430
while enjoying breathing in the fresh air of the greenery.

114
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,430
In other words,

115
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,330
the protest of the inhabitants was settled by financial guarantee?

116
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,830
However, we still get blackmails and crank calls

117
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,030
demanding cancellation of the opening of the ropeway.

118
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,630
Do you have any idea who is doing this?

119
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,830
It's not just one or two people, so...

120
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,230
Besides, there is a priestess called

121
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,430
Shizu Kamiya who resides in a temple nearby

122
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,930
making a fuss saying that the gods will be angered.

123
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,030
The local papers wrote an article,

124
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,130
"Does The Curse Of The Goddess Exist?"

125
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,030
And this is stirring fear among the inhabitants,

126
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,730
that we are in quite a fix.

127
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,530
Huh? That cable car that is headed down is empty, isn't it?

128
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,030
When one cable car moves, so does the other.

129
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,030
It runs like a well bucket going up on two stays,

130
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,730
and is called the "back and forth type".

131
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,730
Oh, I see.

132
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,930
What is that?

133
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,030
They are the 500 disciples of Buddha who have attained Nirvana.

134
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,930
In other words, we'll be taking a tour

135
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,830
inside the womb of the goddess that is above here.

136
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,530
A tour inside the womb?

137
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,230
Does it mean that we can attain good luck

138
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,330
if we go through the body of the goddess?

139
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,230
Well, I guess you could say so.

140
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,330
Come to think of it, that man called Aoyagi mentioned something

141
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,530
about the construction of this tunnel, hadn't he?

142
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,030
I'll bet he's thinking of conjuring up a scandal or something

143
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,130
in order to suck money off of our company.

144
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,330
My sister should've been more careful, too.

145
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,530
Why'd she have to tell a guy like that about it?

146
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,130
About it?

147
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,730
What is it about?

148
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,130
Oh, it's nothing but family business that is not worth mentioning.

149
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,930
We'll be out of the tunnel in about 30 seconds.

150
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,830
See, when the ropeway comes up to here,

151
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,230
the top half of the goddess statue comes into view.

152
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,830
The rock mountain was carved

153
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,630
in the shape of the goddess about 800 years ago.

154
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,130
Her right hand stuck out in front is called the form of the Yoganin.

155
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,730
In her left hand, she is holding the Nyoihoju,

156
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,130
a crystal ball that will get rid of disasters and unhappiness.

157
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,130
For those who want to take a good look at it,

158
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,130
there is an observatory that can be accessed from the promenade.

159
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,530
I sort of understand why the priestess was all upset.

160
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,930
"Mountain Tenbu Station"

161
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,530
What a fantastic view!

162
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,030
You don't get to see Iandscape like this everyday.

163
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,830
People seem so tiny when you see something as grandiose as this.

164
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,430
Yes, but those tiny people are the ones who work

165
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,230
with grandiose nature such as this,

166
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,030
and develop it into tourist sites.

167
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,430
This?

168
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,630
This is a keepsake of my mother.

169
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,630
It's a broche made out of jade beads.

170
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,230
That's not it. Your broche is nice, too.

171
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,630
But I just thought you look a lot like that goddess statue.

172
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,730
-Me? -Yes, kind and refined.

173
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,930
Thank you. It makes me happy even if you're just flattering me.

174
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,930
I'm not flattering you. Right, Conan?

175
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,030
Right.

176
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,730
-Ms. Yoshino. -Yes?

177
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,830
Will you please see Mr. Mouri to his hotel?

178
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,930
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,230
What are you going to do?

180
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,530
I'm going down the promenade to do final checks

181
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,330
on the condition of the facilities, then come back.

182
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,030
I'll see you at the ceremony tomorrow afternoon, then.

183
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,730
He's the vice president and yet very diligent, isn't he?

184
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,230
Of course!

185
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,830
The life of the company is on his shoulders.

186
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,730
"Hotel Doumoto"

187
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,930
Just great!

188
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,530
Dad, I think you've already had enough.

189
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,530
Well, they got a suite room, you know!

190
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,430
I want to enjoy it with my entire heart and soul, so don't lose out.

191
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,530
Well, I guess it is a glamorous room.

192
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,630
I wonder if it's okay.

193
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,530
They must be loaded with cash!

194
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,730
You don't have to worry about it!

195
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,030
But it seemed like the second son, Junpei

196
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,730
and the oldest daughter, Rina had financial problems.

197
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,530
Yes, it seemed so.

198
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,430
And they didn't seem to be getting along well either.

199
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,130
When it comes time to inherit the estate,

200
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,230
I'll bet they'll go through soemthing worse.

201
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,030
It'll be so bad that bloody rain is likely to fall.

202
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,930
Cut it out, dad! What a thing to say!

203
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,530
I wonder why the opening ceremony

204
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,830
is going to be held in the afternoon?

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,260
Mr. Machida, shouldn't we be holding interviews,

206
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,160
rather than sitting here?

207
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Hold your horses.

208
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
I didn't come here to write up a flop.

209
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,760
Where the heck is Conan?

210
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,460
He told me he had to go to the men's room.

211
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,260
Conan, it's going to start soon.

212
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,660
Okay.

213
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,360
Preparations are perfect.

214
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,160
Nobody has noticed anything.

215
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
Your "perfect" can never be counted on!

216
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,460
You can't even get rid of a hyena blackmailer like Aoyagi.

217
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,960
But that's...

218
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,660
Don't talk back to me!

219
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,060
In business, all that matters are results!

220
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,960
The way you are, I can't leave the company to you!

221
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,360
President, let's start making preparations.

222
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,360
Ladies and gentlemen, the central figure of the formal opening

223
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,760
of the Mountain Tenbu ropeway, President Eizo Doumoto of Doumoto Tours,

224
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,260
will present his speech.

225
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,060
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today

226
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,160
on this memorable event.

227
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,060
We, at Doumoto Tours, who are the leaders of the tourism industry

228
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,860
have always tried to preserve cultural heritage from the days...

229
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,460
You darn sinners!

230
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,360
The curse of the heavens

231
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,960
will fall upon all of you present here today!

232
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,160
You idiot! Just what are you doing?

233
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,660
-Take pictures! -Oh, shoots.

234
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,260
To do something as outrageous as to dig a tunnel

235
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,060
under the lotus pedestal of the holy goddess

236
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,660
is totally abominable!

237
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,360
All of you, know thy shame!

238
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,860
May the curse of the heavens fall upon Eizo Doumoto!

239
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,460
We seem to have had a guest here that was not invited,

240
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,660
but please do not concern yourselves over her.

241
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,260
Even the papers have irresponsibly written gibberish

242
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,160
about that statue of the goddess!

243
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,660
However, I, Eizo Doumoto

244
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,360
shall scatter all such nonsense away for you!

245
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,560
That is why we have with us here today,

246
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,460
among our honored guests,

247
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,960
the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri!

248
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,960
Well, hello. Everyone, I am Kogoro Mouri!

249
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,260
Thank you, thank you!

250
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,360
Mr. Machida, this is really something!

251
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,560
Kogoro Mouri is here!

252
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,860
Don't you think there's something fishy going on?

253
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,260
What? You mean it's not him, but a look alike?

254
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,660
Oh, never mind.

255
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,460
Why on earth did Eizo Doumoto call us here for?

256
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,060
The Mountain Tenbu will now begin its first trial run.

257
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,460
The second group of people will get on the second cable

258
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,360
that will arrive after the first cable car reaches the top.

259
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,160
Huh?

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,260
The two there are journalists from Tokai Nippo,

261
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,560
the agency that is attacking Doumoto Tours.

262
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,660
Why would they be here before all the other agencies

263
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,160
and take the trial run?

264
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,960
You fools.

265
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Look, Aoyagi. The view is fantastic.

266
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,460
How do you like it, Mr. Machida?

267
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,860
Why not try writing some good things about us for a change?

268
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,060
Are you trying to bribe me?

269
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,160
If you do, I'll make an article of that, too.

270
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,660
I wonder how long you'll be able to stay obnoxious like that.

271
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,060
Hey, Mr. Machida. Take a look at that!

272
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,260
The statues of the 500 disciples of Buddha who attained Nirvana?

273
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,860
You mean you made things like that using the power of money?

274
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,460
I'd rather you take me to be a religious man.

275
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,860
I'm sure that this would become the talk of the town

276
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,160
and we'll have visitors avalanching in.

277
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,960
Wanting to worship and pray to the statue of the goddess

278
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,860
as well as the statues of the 500 disciples of Buddha.

279
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,360
In other words, I have every reason to be given gratitude

280
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,260
from the statue of the goddess, and no reason to be cursed by it.

281
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
What's up?

282
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,160
What's up? Is it a black out?

283
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Hey, just what do you think you're doing? Don't!

284
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,060
You're...

285
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,960
Somebody! Somebody, give us light!

286
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,860
Use the flash of the camera!

287
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,360
Oh, that's right.

288
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,060
Use the flash once more!

289
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,660
Okay!

290
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,060
What the...

291
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,160
This is...

292
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,060
This is absurd!

293
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,860
The president...

294
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,160
He's gone!

295
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,860
The windows cannot be opened!

296
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,660
The two journalists are by the door to the left!

297
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,560
By the door to the right is Ms. Ayaka!

298
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,360
The ceiling only has a small ventilation hole!

299
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,560
What about the emergency exit?

300
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,160
It hasn't been used yet!

301
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,460
Then, where did he disappear to?

302
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,860
What is with this talisman?

303
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,460
The principle of "cause and effect"?

304
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,060
"Cause and effect"?

305
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,660
You will pay for your sins?

306
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,560
Dad is over there!

307
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,160
What?

308
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,760
That is indeed Mr. Eizo Doumoto!

309
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,660
It looks like something was stabbed into his chest!

310
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,860
Contact somebody with the cell phone immediately!

311
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,560
We can't because there are no antennas in this area yet!

312
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,760
There's a phone once we get to the top though.

313
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,360
This is ridiculous!

314
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,260
Can something like this really happen?

315
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,190
Something happened to the president!

316
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,890
Get the police and let the people below know about this right away!

317
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,790
-Yes, sir! -We'll head down...

318
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,790
to the statue of the goddess using the hiking path!

319
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,890
This is Machida!

320
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,690
Please leave one page of the evening news open!

321
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,490
There's been a curse!

322
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,090
Eizo Doumoto has been stabbed

323
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,190
on top of the palm of the statue of the goddess!

324
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,290
Ms. Ayaka, what's wrong? Are you okay?

325
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,890
I just felt a little dizzy.

326
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,690
Never mind me, check on the president.

327
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,490
Yes. I'll go on ahead, then.

328
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,690
-Let's go, Conan! -Okay.

329
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,990
Mr. Mouri, the statue of the goddess is up these stairs!

330
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,190
It takes 15 minutes to get up here!

331
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,690
He's been stabbed right in the chest and is dead.

332
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,490
Dad!

333
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,490
It can't be! You've have to be joking

334
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,590
saying that he's dead, right, Mr. Mouri?

335
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,290
I understand how you feel but he's dead.

336
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,990
It can't be...

337
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,890
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this.

338
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,080
Vice president, please get a hold of yourself!

339
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,890
Huh? Ms. Ayaka, are you all right?

340
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,690
Yes, I'm fine.

341
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,290
I won't be able to do my job as a secretary,

342
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,090
being rendered helpless at a time like this.

343
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,490
I finally reached it!

344
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,990
Hi, so it's you?

345
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,290
Oh, Mr. Mouri! Not you again?

346
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,690
Just what do you mean? Am I supposed to be the god of death?

347
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,490
If so, have the statue of the goddess help you out this time.

348
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,090
Oh, no!

349
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,790
I'm just delighted that I get to hear your superb deduction again.

350
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,690
Don't tell me that this is some kind of curse, though.

351
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,990
There are rumors of that sort going around.

352
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,190
No such thing!

353
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,890
The killer is among the ones who were in the ropeway!

354
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,690
What? Is that true?

355
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,890
Which means the killers are among those people, right?

356
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,790
Before Eizo disappeared from inside the cable car,

357
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,090
there was a sound of someone fighting.

358
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,390
Moreover, a strange talisman was found pasted to the window.

359
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,090
The killer must have some way pushed Eizo

360
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,990
from the ropeway onto the tunnel below.

361
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,590
But no one who was in the cable car got off

362
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,490
until it reached the top, right?

363
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,890
It is likely that an accomplice was inside the tunnel.

364
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,190
I think that is highly unlikely.

365
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,390
You! Keep your big mouth shut!

366
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,990
Wait a second, Mr. Mouri.

367
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,190
Conan, just what do you mean?

368
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,790
Well, it takes the ropeway only 30 seconds

369
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,490
to get through the tunnel.

370
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,990
Even if there were to be an accomplice,

371
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,690
I wonder if it would be possible to move the victim from the tunnel up

372
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,090
to the palm of the statue of the goddess in just 30 seconds?

373
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,490
Ms. Ayaka, aren't there any secret elevators or something

374
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,590
that can get you from the tunnel to this observatory?

375
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,790
There is no such thing.

376
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,990
Of course, for maintenance purposes,

377
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,490
there is a path leading from the tunnel,

378
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,990
to part way of the stairs of the observatory.

379
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,290
That's it! The killer used that route and killed Eizo.

380
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,090
But to get from the tunnel to the observatory,

381
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,690
it would take even a man who runs at least three minutes.

382
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,190
Three minutes?

383
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,890
Wait a second.

384
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,090
From the time of the black out to the time we found Eizo

385
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,290
in the palm of the statue of the goddess,

386
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,090
it took about 30 seconds.

387
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,290
So, if it takes three minutes...

388
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,990
No, I think it takes even more time.

389
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,490
It's unthinkable that Mr. Eizo Doumoto

390
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,190
would stay quiet being kidnapped.

391
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,190
Which means he would have had to been killed right away.

392
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,490
However, if someone were to carry the corpse on his back

393
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,290
and go from the tunnel to observatory,

394
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,290
it would take double the time which is six minutes, not three.

395
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,790
No, it would probably even take more.

396
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,890
That's right.

397
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,490
It's more unimaginable than the fact

398
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,790
that the victim disappeared from within the ropeway is that thing.

399
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,190
It's a curse!

400
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,890
What a sight having to display a corpse

401
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,390
in the palm of the statue of the goddess.

402
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,990
It sure is rightful punishment from the heavens

403
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,990
for Eizo Doumoto who has turned money hungry!

404
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,290
It's too impossible to be called a homicide.

405
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:19,390
Don't tell me that this is really some kind of curse?

406
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,290
That it really is the fury of the goddess?

407
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,340
Inspector Yokomizo.

408
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,540
We've got the results of the autopsy.

409
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,440
The cause of death was a stab wound

410
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,140
pierced right through his chest with a dagger.

411
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,840
We believe he died instantly.

412
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,840
No fingerprints or palm prints were found on the dagger.

413
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,440
The estimated time of death

414
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,140
is right after he disappeared from the ropeway.

415
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,740
Well, it's just as was assumed.

416
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,540
Okay, block off the esplanade entirely.

417
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,640
Have that elderly go down to the foot of the mountain, too.

418
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,740
Yes, sir.

419
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,840
Sir, what is that shed down below there?

420
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,840
It's a rest house that the construction workers were using

421
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
at the time they were constructing the tunnel.

422
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,440
It's supposed to be destroyed tomorrow.

423
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,740
Then, why is there smoke coming out of there?

424
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,340
I'm not bothering him.

425
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,940
Mr. Yasunori Doumoto.

426
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,540
I have something I'd like you to verify for me.

427
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,340
Do you have any recollection of this dagger?

428
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,640
It's one of my father's collection of daggers.

429
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,940
Which means someone stole the dagger.

430
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,140
Was it under strict security?

431
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,240
No, anyone could've taken it if they wanted to.

432
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
That's not what matters though, the problem is...

433
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,340
Yes?

434
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,940
No...

435
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,440
It's nothing.

436
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,240
He's hiding something.

437
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
What is it?

438
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,640
Thus, this case is about Mr. Eizo Doumoto

439
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,440
being attacked by someone and disappeared in the ropeway.

440
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,640
And there's the talisman that was pasted on the window.

441
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,740
I can't help but come to the conclusion

442
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,840
that the killer is among all of you here.

443
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,640
First, I would like to check on the motive for killing.

444
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,340
Who would benefit most from the death of Mr. Doumoto?

445
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,740
If you mean our father's assets,

446
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
it would be us, who are his children.

447
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,540
Not really. Yasunori is the one who would benefit most.

448
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,240
Especially now that he can assume entire power of the Doumoto Tours.

449
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,540
Junpei!

450
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,740
Yasunori, aren't you happy now that father is dead?

451
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,940
Now, you don't have to get nagged on the job either.

452
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,640
In terms of motive,

453
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,940
I think you guys got as much motive as I do, Rina.

454
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,540
You guys? You mean Aoyagi and me?

455
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,140
Why me?

456
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,840
You made up scandals of our company as well as blackmailed father

457
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,240
by writing letters and making crank calls beforehand.

458
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,340
But father ignored you, that's why you...

459
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,840
Hold it there!

460
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,940
Don't tell me that

461
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,440
you were blackmailing father about that story?

462
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,540
Mr. Aoyagi, what does that story mean?

463
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,440
In order to get this tunnel ready in time,

464
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,940
the construction was started on an outrageous schedule.

465
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,940
This resulted in an accidental in the tunnel

466
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,040
where one was buried alive

467
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,840
and consequently was left to die.

468
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,940
Fearing a bad image falling upon this Mt. Tenbu ropeway,

469
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,640
Eizo Doumoto used cash to silence the family and the people involved

470
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
to erase traces of the accident.

471
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,740
I was so disappointed at my father and left the house.

472
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,740
You mean you had the nerve to blackmail father about it?

473
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,340
You don't have to make me sound so rotten.

474
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,640
All I did was ask to be interviewed about it.

475
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,140
But to assume that I was trying to blackmail him,

476
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,540
he must've really felt guilty about something.

477
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,840
You approached me for that purpose to begin with, didn't you?

478
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,440
Well, you are after all,

479
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,340
the best of all witnesses to what happened back then.

480
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,240
What a guy!

481
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,340
You're pretty good, reading Rina by the nose.

482
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,140
But it seems you couldn't do the same with father.

483
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
Not being able to get the money you wanted,

484
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,340
you got furious and killed father, right?

485
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,140
I didn't kill him!

486
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,840
Talk for yourself, Junpei.

487
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,640
Father kept refusing to give you any financial help.

488
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,740
I'll bet you were pissed about it, right?

489
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,340
What about you, then?

490
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,540
That's enough!

491
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,040
How much shame of the family do you intend to display to the public?

492
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,240
Mr. Machida.

493
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Your agency Tokai Nippo had an anti-ropeway campaign underway.

494
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,440
How come Tokai Nippo managed to get on the first trial

495
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,240
of the ropeway rather than other agencies?

496
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,540
Who knows?

497
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,940
We've been wondering about that, too.

498
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,540
Don't you think it better to ask the vice president about that?

499
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,440
Mr. Yasunori, would you explain?

500
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,740
Explain?

501
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,540
Well, the president wanted the people who are against

502
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,440
the development of the ropeway to be first ones to ride it,

503
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,740
so as to make them understand how wonderful it is.

504
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,940
I wonder if that's really the reason?

505
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,740
Could there have been some other reason?

506
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,440
By the way, Mr. Machida,

507
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,040
you were all by the door of the ropeway, weren't you?

508
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,740
Are you insinuating that we pushed Eizo Doumoto out the window?

509
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,940
I don't think that's possible.

510
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,340
Because the door on Mr. Machida's side was locked.

511
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Moreover, it's a double lock

512
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,740
and I had the keys, so it couldn't have been opened.

513
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,840
Which means that you had free access to the door

514
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,040
and could open it If you wanted to.

515
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,640
No, she couldn't have committed the crime either.

516
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Although it was in the dark,

517
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,940
I think it would've been impossible for her

518
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,640
to move a struggling man over to the door

519
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,340
and push him out with her strength.

520
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,940
I wonder?

521
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,840
I don't think it is impossible, though.

522
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
I was sitting right next to the door,

523
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,340
but I didn't hear the rattling of the door opening.

524
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,040
However, the window cannot be opened either.

525
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,840
And the emergency exit doesn't seem to have been used.

526
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,640
Then how...

527
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Anyway, will you all please walk on down to the foot of the mountain?

528
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,440
Let's talk over the details there.

529
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,540
Oh, Mr. Yasunori.

530
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,540
Is it okay for us to use the special guest room?

531
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,240
Yes, of course. Please be my guest.

532
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,640
Mr. Yasunori sure is acting a bit strange.

533
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,440
Yes, I'm sure he's hiding something.

534
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,140
No. He wants to say something, but is hesitant of mentioning it.

535
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,240
What one earth is it that he wants to say?

536
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,040
Come to think of it, back then...

537
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,640
Preparations are perfect.

538
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,040
Nobody has noticed anything.

539
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,540
The conversation back then,

540
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,740
and when Mr. Eizo's corpse was found...

541
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,440
It can't be...

542
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,740
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this.

543
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Maybe he was expecting some other result?

544
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,840
Is there such a thing as the curse of the statue of goddess?

545
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,340
We come to write an article on it and we end up as suspects.

546
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,140
Could this really be some kind of a curse?

547
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,740
Don't be ridiculous! We're lucky.

548
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
This is a real scoop!

549
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,340
The other result may be...

550
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,240
Even if we were to ask Mr. Yasunori

551
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,040
to come to the station with us on his own initiative,

552
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,840
we still have to figure out how

553
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,640
Mr. Eizo disappeared from the ropeway

554
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,740
ended up being found in the palm of the statue of the goddess

555
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,840
in a matter of seven seconds.

556
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,040
That's right.

557
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,440
Well, that's the biggest problem.

558
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,340
The corpse couldn't have walked

559
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,640
all the way up to the goddess on its own.

560
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,540
It couldn't be that...

561
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,240
No. But if that were to be the case...

562
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,540
It must be that shed...

563
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,340
I've found it!

564
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,740
What's this? There something stuck to it.

565
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,340
This is...

566
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,640
Worker's slacks. Just great!

567
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
All I need now is...

568
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Okay. I can use that mop.

569
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,340
All set.

570
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,040
Hey!

571
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,440
Just what are you doing here?

572
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,240
You scared the wits out of me.

573
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,540
What do you mean I scared you?

574
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,640
You'd get people worried disappearing all of a sudden.

575
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,540
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,440
Right, Ran!

577
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,740
What is it?

578
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,440
I'm a bit cold, so won't you lend me your jacket?

579
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,240
Okay, sure.

580
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
-Here you go. -Thanks!

581
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,940
I'll be waiting for you at the foot of the mountain, then.

582
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,340
Oh, Conan!

583
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,740
What? So, you're leaving me here like this?

584
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,040
It's just as I thought.

585
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,340
Mr. Yasunori, in the ropeway,

586
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,840
you were sitting beside Mr. Eizo.

587
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,540
It's strange that you didn't notice a thing.

588
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,840
Just what are you hiding?

589
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,740
I'm not hiding anything.

590
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,140
You re talking Iike I'm the killer or something!

591
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,340
Show me the evidence, will you?

592
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
No, I didn't say you were the killer or anything.

593
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,640
Since it's such a mysterious case,

594
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,740
we're trying to catch some clues by questioning all of you.

595
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,040
Then, why don't you also question everybody else?

596
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,440
Well, that's of course.

597
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,640
Conan!

598
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,340
You came down before me,

599
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,940
and yet why are you here after me?

600
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,240
I sort of got lost.

601
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Won't you please let us go already?

602
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,240
I have no motive for killing Eizo Doumoto.

603
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,640
So, you don't want to have anything to do with anybody here

604
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,340
because you can't blackmail any longer, right?

605
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,040
I can't stand watching

606
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,240
the ugly dispute over family affairs any longer!

607
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,840
Watch your mouth!

608
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,240
Now, now. Everyone, cool it.

609
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
It'll only be a while longer.

610
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,340
Inspector Yokomizo!

611
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,940
Why don't we all try riding the ropeway again?

612
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,540
The ropeway?

613
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,340
Hey, stay out of this!

614
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,040
Yes, let's ride it!

615
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,740
They say its best to go to the site a hundred times.

616
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,640
We may find something new.

617
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,540
We're riding that stuff again?

618
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,240
There's no curse or anything like that is involved in this case.

619
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,840
I've figured out why the two journalists of Tokai Nippo

620
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,740
were invited on the test run.

621
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,240
And the trick as to how Mr. Eizo disappeared

622
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,640
as well as Mr. Yasunori's strange remark.

623
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,140
And the wrist in the incinerator.

624
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,840
I'm going to figure the entire mystery inside the ropeway.

625
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,990
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that you're...

626
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,990
Shut up! Does it bother you?

627
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,490
Oh, no!

628
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,890
I'm relieved now that I know

629
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,690
that the renown detective is just as human as we all are.

630
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,090
Hey, Ran.

631
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,290
You see...

632
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,790
What? Why do something like that?

633
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,190
Pops said to do it secretly.

634
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,290
Dad said so?

635
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,490
Okay.

636
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,790
10 sheep, 11 sheep...

637
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,490
Pops, are you trying to fall asleep or something?

638
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,890
Don't talk to me! I'll forget what I'm counting.

639
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,790
-What number sheep was it? -Okay.

640
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,290
I'll let you sleep as much as you want.

641
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,090
It's come...

642
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,190
Mr. Mouri, what's wrong?

643
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,190
So, it's finally coming!

644
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,790
Dad!

645
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,890
Take a picture of him.

646
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,690
He has become the Sleeping Kogoro!

647
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,790
Yes, sir.

648
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,590
Mr. Yasunori, excuse me for all my rude remarks.

649
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:57,190
But I knew from the start

650
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,490
that you are not the one who killed Mr. Eizo.

651
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,890
Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

652
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,090
Didn't you have plans with Mr. Eizo

653
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,290
to do something that would surprise everyone

654
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,490
at today's commencement event?

655
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,490
A large scale scheme that would get rid of the rumor of the curse

656
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,190
of the statue of goddess that is creating a bad image of the ropeway

657
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,090
as well as something

658
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,090
that would be a great way to advertise the ropeway.

659
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,090
I will now attempt to replay your plan.

660
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,590
What on earth is going on?

661
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,490
(Chanting)

662
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,990
It's the same thing that happened back then.

663
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,790
What's about to happen? Cut it out!

664
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,390
Ran is gone?

665
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,890
It's just like the time father disappeared.

666
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,490
How on earth...

667
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,690
Is something like this possible?

668
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,390
Mr. Mouri, where did your daughter disappear to?

669
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,790
Please look at the statue of the goddess.

670
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,990
It can't be...

671
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,890
Look, on top of the palm of the statue of the goddess!

672
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,090
Ran? No...

673
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,790
A dummy wearing Ran's jacket?

674
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,490
Exactly! It is made with a mop and some branches.

675
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,890
Come out here, Ran.

676
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,890
What?

677
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,490
Under the seat?

678
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:42,690
Mr. Yasunori, you thought up this grand scaled yet simple plan,

679
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,590
and Mr. Eizo acted out.

680
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,290
Isn't that right?

681
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,090
Yes, that's right.

682
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,290
I asked an acquaintance who is a doll maker

683
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,490
to secretly make a rubber dummy duplicate of my father.

684
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,590
The day before the commencement ceremony

685
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:04,690
and after I left your party and started off down the esplanade,

686
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,590
I stopped over at the observatory

687
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,890
to pick up the dummy that I had asked to be made beforehand

688
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,090
and put it on the palm of the statue of the goddess.

689
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,790
The palm of the statue of the goddess

690
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,790
can only be seen from inside the ropeway

691
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,390
that has come out of the tunnel.

692
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,990
That's why I didn't have to worry about being seen by anyone.

693
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,690
You went on to carry out your plan

694
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,890
the following day during the commencement ceremony.

695
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,090
Yes. After we entered the tunnel,

696
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,690
I severed the circuit cord for the lights.

697
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,990
After the lights went out, I immediately

698
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,890
took my recorder out and played the chant.

699
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,990
After father put on an act of being terrified,

700
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,090
he hid in the space under the seat.

701
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,590
And I stuck the talisman onto the window glass.

702
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,690
I'm the one who brushed journalist Nakano's camera onto the ground

703
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,690
because I didn't want the trick to be disclosed by the camera's flash.

704
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,090
The aisle under the seat is the place to put emergency goods,

705
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,990
and weights necessary when the wind is strong,

706
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,990
but I had taken everything out beforehand.

707
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,590
While everyone was headed for the observatory,

708
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,290
my father was supposed to go back to the tunnel

709
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,990
using the empty ropeway,

710
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,690
then jump down.

711
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,390
After arriving at the observatory,

712
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:28,790
he was supposed to take the dummy away from the statue,

713
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,090
then went up in place of the dummy instead.

714
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,790
He was supposed to greet all of us

715
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,490
who went to check on him with a smile.

716
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,590
Well?

717
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,390
There's no such things

718
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,990
as curses and evil spells exist in this world!

719
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,090
He was supposed to convince everyone that there was no grounds

720
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,290
to the rumor that was going around and get rid of it all at once.

721
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,890
So, that's why we were invited to come.

722
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,790
No, that's not the only reason!

723
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,590
Mr. Eizo was planning to frame Tokai Nippo.

724
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,790
Just what do you mean by he was planning to frame us?

725
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,590
Do you have any idea

726
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,790
why the commencement ceremony started in the afternoon?

727
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,390
It's probably the whim of the host.

728
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,290
Mr. Machida, you sent in an article from the top of the mountain, right?

729
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,390
This is Machida!

730
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,390
Please leave one page of the evening news open!

731
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,990
There's been a curse!

732
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,890
Eizo Doumoto has been stabbed

733
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,790
on top of the palm of the statue of the goddess!

734
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,690
If Eizo were not stabbed,

735
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,290
would you have been able to change the article for something else?

736
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,590
The deadline for the evening news is 1:30 pm!

737
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,590
Right! Your agency would have put false information in the papers.

738
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,690
In other words,

739
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,990
Mr. Eizo's purpose for scheming this trick

740
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,190
was to prove that no such thing as a curse existed

741
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,890
as well as to soil the reputation of Tokai Nippo.

742
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,090
I see.

743
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,490
That's why he said what you did back then.

744
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,890
I wonder how long you'll be able to stay obnoxious like that.

745
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,090
What a dirty thing to do!

746
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,490
By the way,

747
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,690
aside from curses and spells,

748
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,790
there is another sad tragedy hidden

749
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,690
behind the tunnel of this ropeway, isn't there?

750
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,490
The accidental death of the worker.

751
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,690
I heard about it from Rina.

752
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,990
Can you tell us about it, Mr. Yasunori?

753
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,090
The person who passed away was called Takahata.

754
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,090
His mother was not only sickly,

755
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,290
but had long years of obligatory feelings towards the Doumoto family,

756
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,990
so father forcibly made them agree not to publicize about it

757
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,990
in return for cash.

758
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,390
Did the late Mr. Takahata have any other family members alive?

759
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,390
I've heard that his father who had divorced 10 years ago

760
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,990
took his younger sister along to Tokyo with him.

761
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,290
It could be that his sister

762
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,790
is here in the ropeway with us.

763
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,790
What?

764
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,690
But the only ones in this ropeway are...

765
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,490
Ms. Yoshino, don't tell me that...

766
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,890
Yes, the one who killed Mr. Eizo Doumoto

767
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,690
is you, Ms. Ayaka Yoshino!

768
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,590
She killed dad?

769
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,390
Unbelievable.

770
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,390
Ms. Ayaka is the killer?

771
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,490
No way.

772
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,690
The killer had to be someone

773
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,790
who could act secretly with Mr. Eizo,

774
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,890
and someone he would not suspect.

775
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,690
Ms. Ayaka stayed back at the ropeway station because she wasn't well.

776
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,090
Then, she got on the ropeway headed downward.

777
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,390
Since the station at the top of the mountain was in chaos

778
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,590
because of what happened to the president,

779
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,090
nobody noticed that she gets onto the ropeway headed downward.

780
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,590
Since you were going around with the president,

781
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,990
you stabbed him on top of the palm of the statue of goddess.

782
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,090
Then, you burned his dummy in the incinerator.

783
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,290
After you made everything was burned,

784
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,490
you went back to the observatory where everyone was.

785
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,390
The only one who could've committed this crime was you

786
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,890
who knew the secret between Mr. Eizo and Mr. Yasunori.

787
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,990
What you just mentioned are all mere assumptions!

788
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,490
Mr. Yasunori.

789
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,790
Will you please open the package that is right beside me?

790
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,390
Yes.

791
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,090
This one, right?

792
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,590
This is...

793
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,890
What's that?

794
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,390
Could this be the the dummy's wrist?

795
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,890
This was found left in the incinerator.

796
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,690
When Ms. Ayaka burned the dummy,

797
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,690
she dropped something very important

798
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,590
on it's hand!

799
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,790
What is this?

800
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,490
It looks like jewelry or something.

801
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,890
Oh, no. Don't tell me...

802
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,990
Yes.

803
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,590
The jade that belongs on the broche that you have on your chest.

804
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,790
If we enlarge the picture that was taken

805
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,890
during the commencement ceremony,

806
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,690
it is plain to see that nothing was wrong with your broche

807
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,490
before you got on the ropeway.

808
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,090
It's exactly as Mr. Mouri says.

809
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,790
Could you tell us why you did it?

810
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,690
Although our parents were divorced,

811
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,590
I kept in touch with my brother all the time,

812
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,790
and we used to encourage each other.

813
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,190
Last year when my mother fell into critical condition

814
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,090
I went to see her at the hospital.

815
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,490
She told me about the mortifying death of my brother while crying.

816
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:18,390
As well as the hatred she felt for Eizo Doumoto before she died.

817
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:23,290
I hid my identity and entered Doumoto Tours

818
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,190
so that I could avenge the death of my brother

819
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,190
who had been driven to his death by Eizo Doumoto,

820
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,790
as well as to take revenge for my mother who suffered because of him.

821
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,590
Ms. Ayaka...

822
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,890
She's so kind and nice and yet...

823
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,890
The reason the story of the statue of the goddess's curse

824
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,590
were handed down for generations probably to teach

825
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,890
that if people do wrong or commit an unforgivable crime,

826
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,490
a terrifying end awaits us.

827
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,490
Just like the case this time.

828
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,390
Oh, no. I fell asleep!

829
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,690
Huh?

830
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,190
Hey! Where is everybody?

831
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,690
Hi there, Sleeping Kogoro!
