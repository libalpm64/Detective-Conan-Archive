1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,680
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,880
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,680
Today's stage is really a stage.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,780
Behind the act is the scenario of a murder.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,280
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,180
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,380
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,390
"The Strolling Players Troupe (Part 1)"

9
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,290
What? The leader of a strolling players troupe?

10
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,290
Yes. "The Tamanosuke Troupe.

11
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,890
A special stage performance in announcement

12
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,990
of the succession of the professional name." It says.

13
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,290
So, are you acting out a woman's part too?

14
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,890
Well, I guess so.

15
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,290
Before the main stage today,

16
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,390
I'm planning to dance three songs,

17
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,890
while switching costumes in the wink of an eye.

18
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,590
I'll go see you! I promise!

19
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,490
What shall I do?

20
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,590
How fantastic.

21
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,690
How lucky because a strolling players troupe

22
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,090
can travel throughout the country.

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,390
Yes. We make our annual or 2 year rounds

24
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,390
and perform for our fans.

25
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,090
Huh? Then, have you come to Beika Theater before?

26
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,090
Yes, 2 years ago.

27
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,290
But back then, my father was the troupe leader,

28
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,490
and I was just an ordinary actor.

29
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,490
So, we didn't advertise ourselves like this.

30
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,290
Did your father pass away?

31
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,090
A year ago, because of an illness.

32
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,090
After that, the members of our troupe

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,690
decreased to half of what it used to be.

34
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,590
It's quite embarrassing, but the going's quite tough.

35
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,390
I see.

36
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,590
Don't worry! I'll go and pass all this out for you.

37
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,690
You can count on me to do things like this.

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,290
You go ahead and practice all you like.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,390
Thank you. I'll do my best.

40
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,790
So, that's the story.

41
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,090
I know he's going to be going to another school in a month,

42
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,090
but I'd like to help him while he's here.

43
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,190
I'll bet that's how he deceives people

44
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,990
into passing out leaflets for him, isn't it?

45
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,690
No! Passing out leaflets is just an excuse.

46
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,490
What I really want to do is go see his dressing room.

47
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,890
You idiot!

48
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,990
If you have such time, go do your studies!

49
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,690
I'm sorry! So, I'm taking Ran with me.

50
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,690
-Let's go. -Hey!

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,090
Don't worry!

52
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,890
Tamanosuke is a weak handsome guy,

53
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,490
so he can't possibly be a bad person, right?

54
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,790
Yes.

55
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,290
And besides, if worse comes to worse,

56
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,190
strike out a kick for me, honey.

57
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,290
What's that supposed to mean?

58
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm not your bodyguard, you know.

59
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,490
Sorry, sorry. Let's hurry and go.

60
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,890
-Hey, Ran. -Huh?

61
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,290
It's you again.

62
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,690
May I go too?

63
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,790
-We'll go too. -Yes!

64
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,290
No! We'll be a nuisance going in a big group!

65
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,690
I promise I'll take you when the stage performance begins.

66
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,390
So, you all stay put.

67
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,190
I'll be back by dinner time.

68
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,690
He said to come in from the dressing room entrance

69
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,990
but the main entrance is open.

70
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,190
Yes.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,390
"Beika Theater" -Let's go in from here.

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,490
-What? -They may be practicing.

73
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,390
-Wait, Sonoko. -No sweat, no sweat.

74
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,390
They're practicing!

75
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,990
Fantastic!

76
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,390
-Hi! Thanks for coming. -Hello.

77
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,890
Sorry to intrude on you...

78
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,990
We're sorry for intruding on you...

79
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,290
What?

80
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,490
Hello! Little ones, thanks for coming.

81
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,390
I told you guys not to come!

82
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,890
It's okay.

83
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,490
I'm glad you came in a group.

84
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,690
Really? Tamanosuke, you're kind, aren't you?

85
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,290
Let me introduce you.

86
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,090
This is Ryuichi Muraki,

87
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,290
the star of our troupe, who can handle anything.

88
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,490
Hi there!

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,690
This is Yuri Shirai. She plays the role of the young lady.

90
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,190
Nice to meet you.

91
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,990
I am Sonoko and this is Ran,

92
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,590
who will be helping pass out the leaflets.

93
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,090
Your actions are really neat.

94
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,290
Nowadays, unless you possess some special characteristic,

95
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,890
-the audience do not catch on. -True.

96
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,490
We were hired here

97
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,390
because we belonged to the gymnastics club in our school days.

98
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,990
Not really. Just do your best.

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,790
Well, we're going to the dressing room,

100
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,390
so I'll leave the rest up to all of you.

101
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,490
Come. Will you climb up from here?

102
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,990
Okay...

103
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,990
Leader!

104
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,590
Will you hurry it up with the scripts while you're at it?

105
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,190
I got it. I'm sorry, but wait just a little while more.

106
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,190
Gosh.

107
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,590
I'm glad the theater is closed tomorrow.

108
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,690
We'll leave as soon as we receive the leaflets.

109
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,290
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,090
Don't let him bother you.

111
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,490
All that's left to do is to get the scripts for the new play.

112
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,890
But, isn't your performance going to start day after tomorrow?

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,290
We can't afford to completely rent the theater and practice,

114
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,990
so it's always like this.

115
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,590
You're really busy, aren't you?

116
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,590
Why aren't we doing the same play as we did before

117
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,090
and doing a new play instead?

118
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,790
Megumi.

119
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,290
She's my younger sister, Megumi.

120
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,790
Hello.

121
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,590
I'm his younger sister Megumi,

122
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,590
who has become like a mother to him because he's unreliable.

123
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,690
Nice to meet you.

124
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,390
Hey.

125
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,690
At any rate!

126
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,390
Everybody's upset over your selfishness!

127
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,290
You have no time to be having a good time with girls, do you?

128
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,790
Hey, Megumi.

129
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,590
We just happened to pop in without an invitation.

130
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,390
I'll take care of them,

131
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,490
so you go and get the scripts ready, leader.

132
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,790
Okay.

133
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,890
Hurry on!

134
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,490
Please enjoy your tour around the dressing room.

135
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,990
I'll see you later.

136
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,190
Gosh.

137
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,990
He says he's having a tough time after his father's death,

138
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,390
but he's the one who's giving himself a tough time.

139
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,090
You're Conan! Thanks for coming!

140
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,390
Hey, how come you know Conan's name?

141
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,690
Because I just started going to Teitan Elementary from today.

142
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,290
You're not in our class, are you?

143
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,190
I'm in class C.

144
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,990
But Conan looked so much like my brother when he was young

145
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,990
that I asked one of the girls in my class his name.

146
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,990
I'm so happy that we got to be friends so soon!

147
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,390
Okay, I'll show you the leader

148
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,190
and my scene dressing room first.

149
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,090
You can all come along, too!

150
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,390
What's with her?

151
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,490
How cute. He's so quite popular, isn't he?

152
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,990
Please wait a while

153
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,390
because I haven't unpacked all my things yet.

154
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,490
Hey.

155
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,790
Here it is!

156
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,390
See, look.

157
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,990
They look alike, don't they?

158
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,990
How cute!

159
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,190
Hey, which part of him looks like me?

160
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,390
Come on, he's a fag.

161
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,990
He plays the star female role in the troupe.

162
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,990
Let's see.

163
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,390
Tamanosuke is so cute!

164
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,990
Really. He looks just like Conan.

165
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,690
You may become cute if you put on make-up too, Conan.

166
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,890
Right?

167
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,690
I'll take you to everybody else's dressing room, then.

168
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,590
Please come this way.

169
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,590
Children are so innocent.

170
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,790
-Huh? -Please let us take a look around, Itoe.

171
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,790
She is Itoe Ogiwara, an accountant.

172
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,790
But she is also an actress.

173
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,790
They are Conan Edogawa,

174
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,390
his friends and his older sister and her friend.

175
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,690
Nice to meet you all. Please come in.

176
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,390
Since my costume is ready, I'm going over to the office.

177
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,390
Is he your boyfriend, Megumi?

178
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,790
No, he isn't!

179
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,590
I'm sorry, so he's your boyfriend?

180
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,890
Wrong again.

181
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,590
I am a princess.

182
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,090
This is funny!

183
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,190
Conan, let's join them too.

184
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,190
Ran, let's go home. Please!

185
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,690
Experience makes perfect! Try it.

186
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,190
Cut it out!

187
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,490
What was that?

188
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,290
Shut up, I'm telling you!

189
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,590
What's up? Leader!

190
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,390
Hey you! Just what do you think you're doing?

191
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,690
It's just a slight difference in opinion.

192
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,990
Tamanosuke!

193
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,290
Are you all right?

194
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,390
Yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,190
Tamanosuke!

196
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,890
What about the scripts, Mr. Chikaishi?

197
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,590
It's done. I'm printing it out now.

198
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,990
He told me to rewrite the last part

199
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,290
so I gave him a licking.

200
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,790
You've got teach him the ways of the world while he's young,

201
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,390
or he'll grow up to be a good-for-nothing adult.

202
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,990
Don't you agree, Mr. Tajima?

203
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,290
Knowing the ways, we can all live happily, right?

204
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,690
Oops, I'm out of tobbaco.

205
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,990
Mr. Tajima. Go get the same type of tobbaco for me, will you?

206
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,890
Mr. Tajima, I'll go buy the tobbaco.

207
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,390
No, it's okay.

208
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,690
Mr. Tajima.

209
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,390
I won't forgive you, Chikaishi Sensei!

210
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,490
Megumi, don't...

211
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,390
Mr. Chikaishi.

212
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,990
Why did you change it from how we had it arranged to begin with?

213
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,990
Fact is fact, and a drama is drama.

214
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,790
That's all I can say.

215
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,990
Okay, we'll go with that.

216
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,590
We've got to start reading practice right away,

217
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,890
so please hurry.

218
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,890
I'm all right.

219
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,690
When he finishes printing the script out,

220
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,790
please make copies.

221
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,790
I'll go and rest in my room till then.

222
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,790
Tamanosuke...

223
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,090
What's with him?

224
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,790
No matter how young the troupe leader is,

225
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,990
how dare he get that violent.

226
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,390
What's with this strolling players troupe anyway?

227
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,880
Wow. It's being printed and coming out one after the other.

228
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,680
All done!

229
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,080
You've finally finished.

230
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,980
"Memoirs of Itaro, the Detective"

231
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,280
Episode of "Edo Kid, the Thief".

232
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,780
Huh? "Edo Kid, the Thief"?

233
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,180
Yeah. It's the Edo Kid the thief.

234
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,380
He's the model of this story.

235
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,580
Okay, sonny. Give that to me.

236
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,880
Thank you, Sensei.

237
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,880
-I'll go make copies. -Yeah.

238
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,180
Well, I'm finally finished.

239
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,080
I guess I'll go take a snooze.

240
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,680
Hey, what're you guys doing?

241
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,080
This is the document for the Edo Kid, isn't it?

242
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,280
What's this Edo Kid all about?

243
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,480
He's a thief that ransacked a vast area of throughout Japan

244
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,680
starting with the Tokyo area.

245
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,080
He flees just like a thief in the days of the samurai,

246
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,380
running along roofs and somersaulting backwards.

247
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,580
He used to be called by the alias, "The Oedo Kid".

248
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,880
After the mass media broadcasted him,

249
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
he became known as the Edo Kid.

250
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,280
I see.

251
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,980
Did you use the Edo Kid as a model

252
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,280
because there are people in this troupe who can perform acrobatics?

253
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Yeah. We travel all throughout Japan too.

254
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,180
There were times when we were suspected by the police.

255
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,980
The two over there were even summoned by them.

256
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't know what he was thinking,

257
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,480
but the leader wanted to create a new version of the Edo Kid.

258
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,080
That's why you researched in such detail?

259
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,180
Sort of.

260
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,280
When I input this into the computer,

261
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I'll get to see the picture.

262
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,980
Conan, come here a minute.

263
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,080
Your cute sister is here to come get you.

264
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,080
You better go on home before I punch you.

265
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,580
We're sorry to have intruded on you.

266
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,480
Gosh. What do you think you're doing

267
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,780
with somebody who beat Tamanosuke up so bad?

268
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,280
Where is Tamanosuke?

269
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,880
He's resting.

270
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,980
I guess he's really shocked.

271
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,180
So, we're leaving now.

272
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,880
We've got to pass these leaflets out too,

273
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
so follow me.

274
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,980
What? I don't want to go home yet!

275
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,280
Since you barged in here,

276
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,080
you're helping me pass out leaflets.

277
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
Okay.

278
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,280
But the man we met a while ago, left from this side.

279
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,780
It's much closer to go to the stage from this side, too.

280
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,180
This exit is closer to the station.

281
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,380
Hurry.

282
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,680
Is she going to treat us something at the station building?

283
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,980
No, we're going to help pass out leaflets at the station.

284
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,980
-Bummers. -I'll treat you so hurry up.

285
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,580
All right!

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,380
Please drop by to see them.

287
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,980
Please go see them.

288
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
Please go see them.

289
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,980
I'm sure there's something behind those people.

290
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,380
I told you not to sneak out on us like that, Conan.

291
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,580
Gosh! What about passing out the leaflets?

292
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,980
A lady who is a member of the community committee

293
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,380
happened to pass by, and she took all the leaflets.

294
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,780
We don't cheat as much as you do, Conan.

295
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,580
We saw you.

296
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,680
I'll bet you're thinking of going back to the theater?

297
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,180
Right. Just as would be expected of the Youth Detective Squad.

298
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,380
Right.

299
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,280
I'm glad to see you, because I thought you all went home.

300
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,680
Look! Do I look good in this outfit?

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,980
We're going to start practice.

302
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,480
Wish me luck, okay?

303
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,180
Sure! How's the troupe leader?

304
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,380
I'm fine.

305
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,080
I'm sorry about what happened a while ago.

306
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Tamanosuke, you're so good looking!

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
Look, he's Itaro!

308
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Yes! It's a short play,

309
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,280
so if it's okay with you, please watch it.

310
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,580
Okay, thank you.

311
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,480
Look, there's a house!

312
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,280
It's just like the samurai movies on TV.

313
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,880
Watch out! Don't move!

314
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,080
Why is there a hole here?

315
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,380
I'm sorry. That's call a pit.

316
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,480
Please be careful!

317
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,680
This pit is very deep!

318
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,580
You don't want to fall in there!

319
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,780
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.

320
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,080
There's Mr. Thief! He's so neat!

321
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,580
1 minute 40 seconds.

322
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,180
It's taking up too much time.

323
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,680
If he goes into the sleeve of the stage,

324
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,380
go down the stairs while changing clothes,

325
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,880
and if the time that it takes for him to rise upis done in a short time,

326
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,680
it looks neat and like magic!

327
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,280
But it's taking him a while

328
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,080
because there's nobody to help him change clothes.

329
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Hey! Cut out all that embarrassing talk

330
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,780
and show your friends to their seats.

331
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,380
Okay.

332
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,580
This seat is in the center and gives you the best view.

333
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,880
Don't you have to practice too, Megumi?

334
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,580
Oh, no. Don't go home and watch, okay?

335
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,080
-Promise, promise. -Do your best!

336
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,980
I will. See you later.

337
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,580
I wonder how Mr. Chikaishi change the last scene of the script.

338
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
After reading practice,

339
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,280
they continued on to rehearsing the play.

340
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,480
The story is about Itaro, a detective of the city of Edo,

341
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,180
and Okei, his younger sister, as well as his assistant,

342
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,580
who deduce the identity of a great thief called the Edo Kid,

343
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,780
who ransacks each and every district of Japan.

344
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,580
They suspect one of the members of the troupe as being the Edo Kid.

345
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,080
However, after arresting him,

346
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,380
they find out that the Edo Kid is a different person.

347
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,280
It turns out that they mistakenly arrest his twin brother

348
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,680
who is a member of the troupe.

349
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,480
The troupe set off again on a journey to a new place.

350
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,380
The title of this story is "Memoirs of Itaro the Detective".

351
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,580
So it's strange that the main character Itaro

352
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,780
would make a false arrest.

353
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,680
Conan, how did you like it?

354
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,880
-You were fantastic! -Just great!

355
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,180
Aren't you lucky, Megumi?

356
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,480
May I go give my friends juice?

357
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,780
Yeah! Do that.

358
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,680
Wait here, everybody.

359
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,480
Oh, Megumi.

360
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,880
We're going to be doing the finishing up soon,

361
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,180
so can you go get Chikaishi Sensei?

362
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,980
Okay!

363
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
Sensei...

364
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,180
Are you still asleep?

365
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm coming in!

366
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,680
Please get up, Sensei!

367
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,580
Megumi!

368
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,280
Megumi! What's up?

369
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,080
Tamanosuke!

370
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,980
Chikaishi Sensei is dead!

371
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
He was hit on the back of the head.

372
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,980
So, this empty vase is the murder weapon.

373
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,680
Somebody, please call the police!

374
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,280
Okay.

375
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,580
Why is he so nervous?

376
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,480
Could it be that he's just very timid?

377
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,980
Or, is it because...

378
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,980
The floppy is gone?

379
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,980
What's the matter, Tamanosuke? Are you all right?

380
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,280
No, it's nothing.

381
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,080
Is anything missing?

382
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,180
The room looks to have been ransacked.

383
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,680
It's nothing.

384
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,480
What's with him?

385
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,080
Why doesn't he say that the floppy is missing?

386
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,780
The victim is the playwrighter for this troupe,

387
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,880
Mr. Tetsuo Chikaishi, 35 years old. Is that right?

388
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,580
Yes, that's correct.

389
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
Conan!

390
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,080
I didn't see you anywhere, so I came to look if you were here,

391
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,580
and bull's eye.

392
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm sorry.

393
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,980
Gosh, you never learn.

394
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,880
Hello, Inspector.

395
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,080
Hello, Mr. Mouri, what do you think?

396
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,380
He died approximately an hour ago.

397
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,180
There is a possibility that this is an inside job.

398
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,680
Yeah. Where were you all an hour ago?

399
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,780
Well...

400
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,480
We were all practicing the play.

401
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,680
That's right. We were all in the audience

402
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,280
so we watched everyone acting.

403
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,380
Since it was practice,

404
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,180
even those who didn't have a role to play then, were by the sleeve.

405
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,680
The only time anyone was closed off from view

406
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,880
was when the outfits were switched and...

407
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,480
Then, when the pit was used there was only one person?

408
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
Yeah.

409
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,580
He's the only theater staff that came for rehearsal today, too.

410
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,380
Yes, that's right.

411
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,680
A person who can kill Mr. Chikaishi by hitting him,

412
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,180
steal the floppy, hide it and return to stage...

413
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,680
That's right!

414
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,580
Inspector, please look for the floppy disc.

415
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,080
The one that Mr. Chikaishi put on the table.

416
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,480
Right, troupe leader?

417
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,280
Why is he hiding the fact?

418
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,680
Could he have committed the murder

419
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,180
while somebody else stole the floppy?

420
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,480
Or, is he protecting the killer?

421
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,380
Either way, the killer is among the people here!

422
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,780
"The Strolling Players Troupe(Part 2)"
