1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,840
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,140
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,040
There is a clockwork of complex codes in numbers.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,140
But he finds the solution and reveals the culprit.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,260
We were supposed to meet up with Heiji and Kazuha,

9
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,860
but they did not come.

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,860
So, we decided to go look for them.

11
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,160
We called on Mr. Kusukawa, the detective,

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,760
and found out they went

13
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,160
to a certain Itou residence on Kenbashi street.

14
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,160
You must be hungry.

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
But could you wait for a little while, dear?

16
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,960
Your mom is busy right now.

17
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,660
After I finish my work,

18
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,960
I'll feed you. Okay, dear?

19
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,960
Good kitty.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Mommy has to go up to them

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
and let them know where they stand.

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,760
I've got to see to it that they feel it to the bones.

23
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,660
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 2)"

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
Darn it! Where are those Osaka kids?

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,860
I'm completely tired out.

26
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,360
Cheer up, Dad.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Let's have lunch and then start searching for the Itou's again.

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,160
We could have passed them on the way.

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,460
And why must I have lunch this late in this shabby restaurant?

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,260
It's no use complaining now, Dad.

31
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,060
We were supposed to have lunch with them.

32
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,660
Besides, it's kind of old fashioned.

33
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
And I kind of like this house.

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Old fashioned it is.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,560
You don't see a horoscope dispenser so often anymore these days.

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Hey. Make another phone call, Ran.

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,460
They may have gone to my detective agency.

38
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,760
Yes, Dad.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,860
I've tried calling from time to time.

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,560
But I the phone won't connect.

41
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,060
-Hello? -It's me.

42
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,860
Hattori?

43
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,360
What?

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,860
Give me the phone!

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,460
Hey, you guys! Where on earth are you?

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,660
Sorry, sorry.

47
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm with Mr. Kusukawa in a coffee shop.

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,060
We've been talking about detective business

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,060
and forgot to get in touch with you.

50
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,160
Then, is Kazuha there with you, too?

51
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,360
Don't worry about her.

52
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,260
She is alright.

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,960
By the way, Pops,

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,560
we have a cipher that we want you to solve it.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,060
A cipher?

56
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,460
Mr. Kusukawa made the cipher,

57
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,860
and I promised him that I won't go back until I solve it.

58
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,060
I tried everything, but I couldn't solve it.

59
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,760
So, I thought of getting your help while Mr. Kusukawa is out.

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Huh? Aren't Mr. Kusukawa there with you?

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,060
No. One of his mahjong pals called him on the phone.

62
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,360
They need one more player.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,060
He went outside to tell them he can't make it.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Well, I will mail the cipher through the phone right now.

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
You send me the solution by sundown.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,060
Let me know the seven numerals hidden in that cipher.

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,860
Seven numerals?

68
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,760
If you can't solve it, I can't come to you.

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,160
So, hang in there.

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,060
Hey, wait!

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,860
Darn it.

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,760
What a smart kid you are to let Kogoro Mouri think it over for you.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,360
Thanks.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,460
Now, we need to mail the cipher.

75
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,660
He soiled the paper with his blood,

76
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,460
so we can't read the lower half of it.

77
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,060
What?

78
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,360
Didn't you make a copy of it?

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
No. After we got that cipher,

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,860
we were busy interrogating Kusukawa.

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,160
I have memorized all of it.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,760
49 numerals and the order of the alphabets.

83
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,760
Really? Then, tell me

84
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,560
all the 49 letters without looking at the paper.

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,560
But if you give me even one wrong number,

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,760
you will get stained with the blood of that girlfriend of yours.

87
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,960
What's this?

88
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,060
I can't make any sense out of this.

89
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,460
True.

90
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,160
Numerals and four alphabets.

91
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,760
Q, A, K, J.

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,760
Could it be...

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,460
I have no idea what they are supposed to mean.

94
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,360
But Heiji said he won't budge an inch until he solves this.

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm busy!

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,260
Huh? Conan, did you find out something?

97
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,360
Yes. A little.

98
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
What's that?

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Look at these letters.

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,560
The A, J, Q, and K remind me of the letters on playing cards.

101
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,960
So, I've changed them into numbers.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,260
And then?

103
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,760
Then, the numbers turned out to be 64 in all.

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,960
But I noticed that there is one lone number.

105
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,760
That's the nine in the center.

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,660
There's only one nine.

107
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,960
Yes. Take that 9 out,

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,460
and the remaining 63 numerals will make 7 groups of 9 numerals.

109
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,960
If there are seven numerals in this cipher,

110
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,860
each of the seven groups should be a certain number.

111
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,960
But you can't solve it like math.

112
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,460
I see.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
It's just a bunch of nonsense.

114
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,360
Here's your diced steaks, sir.

115
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,860
This is just the thing I've been waiting for.

116
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,660
Hi. This is the Kid's Lunch Plate.

117
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,260
Hey, Pops. Can it be Mr. Kusukawa who coded this cipher?

118
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,860
Yes.

119
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,260
I see. That's why the center is a nine.

120
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,060
Here is your omelette, Miss.

121
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,560
It looks delicious.

122
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,060
Conan?

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,560
It's rather simple once you figure out how to solve it.

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Huh? This looks strange.

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,360
The first four are numerals, but the last three are not.

126
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,760
Wait. I saw these somewhere before.

127
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,860
Now, the time is up.

128
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,160
We have to go now, otherwise we won't make it in time

129
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
to use the safe deposit box.

130
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,760
If you want to blame someone,

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,760
blame it on that incompetent detective of yours.

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,160
Wait! I may be able to solve it overnight.

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,460
You can go to the bank tomorrow

134
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,260
before the letter is delivered to the detective agency.

135
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,360
We are not worried about it.

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,960
Because the letter will not be delivered.

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,660
What? You are not going to...

138
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Yes, we are.

139
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,160
We'll ambush the deliveryman in front of the office

140
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,560
and rob him of the letter.

141
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,060
We will keep paying the fee for using the safe,

142
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,360
and the tape will not come out into this world.

143
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
We will take time to solve the cipher.

144
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,060
Unlike you guys, I have unlimited time on my side.

145
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,360
Now, if you have anything left to say,

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,260
I'll listen to you.

147
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,260
To listen to a person with genuine concern

148
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,660
is a duty for an attorney.

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,060
Darn it. Kudo, you fool.

150
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,760
What are you doing?

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,260
You don't seem to have any concern for this world.

152
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,760
Well then, as you wish...

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
I do... I have a lot.

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,360
I have so many things to say that I was at a loss.

155
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,760
More than anything else,

156
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,860
I want to say a word to the girl behind me.

157
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,160
What do you want to say to her?

158
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,760
You know she will be dead soon, don't you?

159
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,060
I wanted to tell her some important things since a long time ago.

160
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,560
So, would you mind putting your gun on the floor

161
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,160
while I talk to her?

162
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,560
Well, well. After all, you guys are high school kids.

163
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,760
Excuse me for being dense.

164
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
This will do, I hope.

165
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,760
Now, you can start telling her.

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Gosh. Don't rush me.

167
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,260
I am choosing the best words for her.

168
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,860
So that she'll be impressed and can go to heaven with those words.

169
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,860
They must be fascinating and wonderful words.

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,560
He's still alive.

171
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,860
Darn it!

172
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
It's a pity, Heiji.

173
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,960
It was such a good strategy for taking the gun from me.

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Strategy, was it?

175
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,260
Now, get up.

176
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,360
But we are lucky to find him alive.

177
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,860
Now, let's have it. Give me the answer to the cipher.

178
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,460
Or do you want to see the head of your kid friend here blown apart?

179
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,160
Don't tell her, Mr. Kusukawa.

180
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,260
If you do,

181
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,660
it'll only buy you a little more time to go to heaven.

182
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,960
So, let's make them regret what they're doing.

183
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,860
You talk too much!

184
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,060
Heiji!

185
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Now, hurry up!

186
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,360
Give me the answer before I count up to five.

187
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,160
We are running out of time,

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,960
so I won't hesitate to fire at the first person.

189
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,060
Stop it, please!

190
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,860
One.

191
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,760
I really mean it, Kazuha.

192
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,860
-Two. -I really wanted to tell you something...

193
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,360
before I die.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,660
Three.

195
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,760
I've tried to tell so you many times.

196
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,560
Four.

197
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,960
When we were back to back and I felt you trembling.

198
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,760
I wanted to say...

199
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,660
Five.

200
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,240
Oh, my. A mail.

201
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,240
From Kogoro Mouri?

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,640
They couldn't possibly have solved the cipher so soon!

203
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,340
It doesn't look like an answer to me.

204
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,440
Didn't they just send back what we sent them?

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,540
No.

206
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,140
Some of the numerals and alphabets are in different order.

207
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,340
What? Hey, give me the phone.

208
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,940
No... Could I take a look at it, please?

209
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,140
There, take a look.

210
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,140
It looks exactly like the cipher I gave you to solve.

211
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,240
Yes, this one looks very much like it.

212
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,140
But this is an answer to the mail we sent.

213
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,840
This says they found the seven numerals hidden in the cipher.

214
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,040
You are not making it up, are you?

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,940
Then, tell us.

216
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,140
I can't tell you here.

217
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,940
Little one. You don't know what a sorry pickle you're in, do you?

218
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,840
You're the one who don't know what pickle you're in.

219
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
Huh?

220
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,840
Kogoro Mouri knows the answer to the cipher.

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Furthermore, he knows that Mr. Kusukawa made the cipher,

222
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,940
and also that we are with Mr. Kusukawa.

223
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,640
If the three of us disappeared at the same time,

224
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,640
that will make the detective think hard,

225
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
and he'll find out

226
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,140
the meaning of the seven numerals hidden in the cipher.

227
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,140
And that the seven digit number is an ID.

228
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Well, he will take less than a week to find them all.

229
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,640
Don't tell me that you sent your cipher to Kogoro Mouri

230
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,540
knowing what he will do all the while?

231
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,540
We'll be in big trouble, Miss.

232
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,440
We can kill them and run, can't we?

233
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
You talk too much.

234
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,240
You have only two choices.

235
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,840
You kill us,

236
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,140
let Kogoro Mouri get the tape and listen to it

237
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,940
or let me go get the tape,

238
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,640
and exchange us for the tape.

239
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,740
Actually, Mr. Kusukawa can go instead of me.

240
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,740
But he can't possibly play the role with that swollen face of his.

241
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,440
So, I'm telling you I will go instead of him for you.

242
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,040
And as Mr. Kusukawa told you,

243
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,140
if you stop doing bad things and promise not to kill us,

244
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,740
I won't turn you in to the police, so don't worry.

245
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,340
You can't fool me.

246
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,940
You're going to get the tape and rush it to the police.

247
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Then, one of you can come with me

248
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,940
and watch over me to keep me from doing anything funny.

249
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,740
You don't have much time to think.

250
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,940
If we don't get going now,

251
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,540
we won't make it in time to use the safe deposit.

252
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,740
I see.

253
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,940
Okay, I will accept your terms.

254
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
But if the answer to the cipher proves wrong,

255
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,640
you know what will become of you.

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,540
Now, Heiji can go with me,

257
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,140
and the young lady can stay here with him.

258
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Heiji.

259
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,040
What is it, Kazuha?

260
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,640
If we make it through...

261
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,140
If we make it through,

262
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,140
will you tell me what you were going to tell me?

263
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,540
Sure.

264
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
I'll keep on telling you until you get tired of hearing it.

265
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,540
Heiji.

266
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,940
It's gasoline.

267
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,540
As soon as we get a phone call from her saying that she's got the tape,

268
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,040
we'll set fire.

269
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,140
That kid will be surprised to learn

270
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,040
that you are not in front of the house waiting for him,

271
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,240
but are inside the house and that it's on fire.

272
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,440
"Tohto Bank"

273
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,940
All right, Heiji.

274
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,340
Be quick about it.

275
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,640
Enter the seven numbers hidden in the cipher.

276
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,040
Well, don't you want to know how to solve the cipher?

277
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,440
No, that can wait.

278
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,340
Since that cipher was made by Mr. Kusukawa, the gambling man,

279
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,840
you can easily see that those A, J, Q, and K are of playing cards.

280
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,040
Change them into numbers,

281
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,240
and we have 64 numerals in all.

282
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,340
But there's something bothers me

283
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,040
which is number nine in the center.

284
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,540
There are lots of 1 to 6 numbers, but there's only one 9.

285
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,840
That's when it hit me that if I take out the 9,

286
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I can divide the remaining 63 numerals by 9

287
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,540
and get 7 groups of numbers.

288
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,040
Those 7 groups of numbers can stand for a 7-digit number.

289
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,940
And all numbers are in 1 to 6.

290
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,040
For a gambling man,

291
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,940
1 to 6 means only one thing, doesn't it?

292
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,740
A dice.

293
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,440
The code is telling you to put the 9 numerals of 7 groups

294
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,340
into the form of dice of 3 by 3 squares.

295
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,640
But what and where are the seven numerals?

296
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Okay. Let's change the numbers into the dots of dice,

297
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,140
and imagine we are looking at the dice.

298
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,540
The red dots of dice are bigger and striking,

299
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,240
now you can read the seven numbers.

300
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,540
The number comes up to 3156204.

301
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,040
So, it's 3156204.

302
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,240
Probably, the cipher was made into squares

303
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,440
with the center to be nine

304
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,440
because of the image of dice and dots on them.

305
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,640
Look! It's opened.

306
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,340
So, this is it. The tape you wanted to get.

307
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,140
Looks like it. Now, give it to me quickly.

308
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,940
Before doing so, you will learn another interesting tale.

309
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,040
What?

310
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,040
The lower half of the cipher I sent to Kogoro is slightly changed.

311
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,840
The lower three numerals were changed to stand for alphabets.

312
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Alphabets?

313
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,540
Right.

314
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,640
One capital and two small case letters.

315
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
L, I, B.

316
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,840
Libra, the Balance.

317
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,940
A Latin for the balance scale shortened to L-I-B.

318
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,440
Libra?

319
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,340
You don't know?

320
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,440
You wear it on your lapel, don't you?

321
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,140
The attorney's pin in the form of the balance.

322
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Then, Kogoro Mouri might go to my house to...

323
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,140
He probably went and did it

324
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,440
because he sent me back that mail of his.

325
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,840
A mail?

326
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,740
Get them out.

327
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,140
Take them outside the house

328
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,140
to reduce the number of bad guys.

329
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,940
I can't believe it.

330
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,440
You'd better believe it.

331
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,040
Because you have no hands in this game.

332
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,240
Hey, are you there?

333
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,440
You're up there, aren't you?

334
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,140
Don't be so slow. Come on down, guys!

335
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Miss, is that you?

336
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,240
So quick, isn't it?

337
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,940
Did you forget something?

338
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,940
Hey!

339
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,140
What's wrong?

340
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,340
Hey!

341
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,940
Isn't that a soccer ball?

342
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,140
Who is it?

343
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,740
I don't really get it,

344
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,840
but I called the police already.

345
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,640
And I just hope I did something right for them.

346
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,840
The police arrived in time

347
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,040
to securely protect Kazuha and Mr. Kusukawa.

348
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,440
The dishonest attorney and her two men were arrested.

349
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,140
And the case of the cipher, illegal tax evasion, and confinement

350
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,540
was solved and closed in an instant.

351
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,740
So, you used that voice changer to mimic her voice

352
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,440
and lured them to come out.

353
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,140
Then, you used anesthetic gun and a soccer ball to knock them down.

354
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,640
That was great, Kudo.

355
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
You better thank me for it.

356
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,340
I had to come out of the toilet of a restaurant to go up to you.

357
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,840
If you didn't leave like you did back then,

358
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,940
things wouldn't have gotten as complicated as this.

359
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,540
I have no idea that'd you'd be held up by a middle-aged lady like her.

360
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,040
Conan, are you alright?

361
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Your kid's lunch has gotten cold.

362
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,140
I'll be with you in a minute.

363
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,540
A kid's lunch for you?

364
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,740
Ran sometimes orders it for a nice kid like me.

365
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,440
Well, it served as a hint for solving the cipher.

366
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,240
Yes. The red circle on the flag and the one on the die is the same.

367
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,040
By the way, why did Mr. Kusukawa

368
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,640
go to her and talk her out of her wrongdoings

369
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,940
despite knowing that he'd be great bait for the mass media?

370
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,940
Long time ago, Mr. Kusukawa's mom got help from that attorney.

371
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,340
His mother suffered great losses in a fraud

372
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,540
and that attorney helped her at that time.

373
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,840
So, his mother is very grateful.

374
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,340
Because of this memory,

375
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,640
he went to her to talk her out of doing illegal business.

376
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,740
I'm really grateful to you.

377
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,040
I was really in deep water when you came to me.

378
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,140
What deep water are you talking about?

379
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,340
You mean the time when you really wanted to tell me something?

380
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,440
Kazuha.

381
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,940
What was it?

382
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,540
What did you want to tell me

383
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,940
when you felt me trembling against your back?

384
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,840
You better not hear it.

385
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,740
You told me you'd tell until I get tired of hearing it.

386
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,640
What on earth was it?

387
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,040
Well...

388
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,840
Well?

389
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,240
It's about...

390
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Every time you trembled behind me...

391
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,840
your hair...

392
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,040
Your hair like a horse tail pricked me on my neck

393
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,040
and made me so ticklish.

394
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,540
I'm really sorry for you.

395
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,140
Drop dead for once!

396
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,920
"1, 2, 3"

398
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,780
Complex mysteries in three episodes.

399
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,820
Hey, Kazuha. You're not leaving Tokyo so soon, are you?

400
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,360
Why not, Heiji? Did you get yourself another first love in Tokyo?
