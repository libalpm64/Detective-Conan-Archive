1
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,530
He's not feeling well? You mean Uncle Jirokichi?

2
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,330
I thought that he'd be the one to stick around

3
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,730
even if all mankind perished,

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,530
but it seems that he's recently lost his appetite too.

5
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,430
Does he have some kind of serious illness?

6
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,230
I guess you could call it an illness of the heart.

7
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,130
-Heart? -Yes.

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,530
He says he has nightmares every night

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,230
and wakes up sweating.

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,930
He says he sees "you know who" smiling at him in his sleep.

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,230
"You know who"?

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,230
You know. Him! Who else?

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,930
What? Who?

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,530
I'll bet you it's none other than

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,130
that elusive, audacious, dauntless thief.

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,230
That villain that puts on airs, right?

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,830
The start of the age of mystery.

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,230
The detective show on Monday at 7.

19
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,830
Kid is after the Big Jewel

20
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,930
with teleportation that seems impossible.

21
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,530
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,330
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,830
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,170
"Thief Kid's Teleportation Magic"

25
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,770
Darn!

26
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,170
"Jirokichi Suzuki (72)" -No good, no good at all!

27
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,970
A plan like this is totally useless!

28
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,870
We're up against the notorious "Magician Under the Moonlight",

29
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,470
the great Thief Kid.

30
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,170
What makes you think that such half way measures...

31
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,270
will help to capture him?

32
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,670
Sir, I think you should rest a while.

33
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,470
I don't think you should push yourself too far.

34
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,870
It's not good for your body.

35
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,270
Then, will you think up some fantastic plan

36
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,970
to capture him while I'm sleeping?

37
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,870
Oh, well, no.

38
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,070
Are you going to bestow me with some incredible method

39
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,770
of keeping Thief Kid from stealing the "bait"...

40
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:32,670
which I got hold of, the legendary pair of mules "purple nail"?

41
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,970
That's the illusionary gem that even Maria Teresia,

42
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,370
the sovereign leader of the Roman Empire

43
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,970
was said to have been dazzled by.

44
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,970
The dazzling gem on your fingertips

45
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,670
is the 100 karat amethyst!

46
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,270
Who cares about its value?

47
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,770
As long as it attracts his attention that's all that counts.

48
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,570
It seems that he just can't resist large gems.

49
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,570
Even if I were to be able to fish him with this bait,

50
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,970
I still have no skills to actually capture him.

51
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,970
I have no means to surprise him out of his wits.

52
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,070
About the strategy of putting the mule

53
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,170
into the middle of a gigantic block of ice.

54
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,470
I think is a pretty good idea.

55
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,270
But I don't think Thief Kid, no matter how good he is,

56
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,270
can take something so big away that easily.

57
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,970
Answer me then.

58
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,070
Just where would you exhibit it?

59
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,470
Well, of course I think I would put it

60
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,270
inside a sealed refrigerator or something.

61
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,470
Fool! If I do so, I won't be able to show the people

62
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,470
when I seize him live with my hands.

63
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,870
Besides, if I dunk it in ice,

64
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,470
the legendary mules will go to waste, you idiot!

65
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,970
Then, what about this suggestion?

66
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,770
We place the mules on top of the Tokyo Tower

67
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,370
and surround it with the helicopters of the Suzuki Financial Group.

68
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,570
This way, the spectators get to watch what's going on.

69
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,170
Have you forgotten?

70
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,170
He possesses that white-winged hang glider.

71
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,970
He's so at home in the sky, that we don't stand a chance.

72
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,070
I'm sure that he'll take what he wants

73
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,870
and fly off with the moon behind him again.

74
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,070
Wait a sec.

75
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,170
Why in the first place does he have the moon behind him?

76
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,470
I'm sure it's because it's night time.

77
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,370
I mean thieves usually work at night.

78
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,570
That's not it.

79
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,270
I'm asking why the moon

80
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,170
is so conveniently positioned behind him all the time.

81
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,870
Maybe he has it all cleverly calculated?

82
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,170
After all, that's more stylish.

83
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,770
Besides, everything he's after

84
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,770
is usually on the top most floor of a building or a museum,

85
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,170
so it's only natural that the moon is there.

86
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,670
High places seem to go hand in hand with Thief Kid.

87
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,870
I see!

88
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,870
I see. There's something I can still do.

89
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,270
I didn't think he'd exhibit the treasure

90
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,470
right in the center of Ginza.

91
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,970
It's just as if he's asking Thief Kid to come and get it.

92
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,570
Right.

93
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,270
Is it going to be all right, Sonoko?

94
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,270
Yep!

95
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,870
All I want is for my darling Thief Kid to appear

96
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,270
and get a glimpse of him. That's good enough for me!

97
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,170
Sonoko.

98
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,070
Well, it seems that Uncle Jirokichi has something in mind, though.

99
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,970
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?

100
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,270
"Ginzou Nakamori (41)" -Any problem, Inspector Nakamori?

101
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,470
Problem packed!

102
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,770
How dare you place treasure that's only guarded by four security guards

103
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,770
in the middle of the road like that.

104
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,070
Left that way, Thief Kid will get to it in no time.

105
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,170
Then, what would you do, Inspector?

106
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,470
Well, I'd place it someplace like a high building,

107
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,870
where it would be more difficult for him to get to.

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,170
That's it! That's just what was so stupid of me.

109
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,170
The police as well as I, without being aware,

110
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,270
was playing the game the way he wanted us to.

111
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,870
We were made to think that the best place to confront

112
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,770
that white-wing thief is some place staged high from the ground.

113
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,470
And time after time,

114
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,370
he repeatedly used those wings of his to escape.

115
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,970
Then, don't tell me that you deliberately placed it on the ground...

116
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,570
Right, in order to tear off his wings!

117
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,470
After all, he's no bird, so once he's on the ground,

118
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,470
he won't be able to fly off using his hang glider.

119
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,370
But...

120
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,070
Kid...

121
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,670
What if he mingles among the crowd

122
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,370
instead of fly through the sky?

123
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,670
Then, all we need to do

124
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,070
is check all of the people there carefully one by one.

125
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,170
If you got notice from the Kid saying he'd be appearing,

126
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,870
I'd have dispatched the riot task force

127
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,170
and fenced in this entire area.

128
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,170
I just happened to slam the challenge notice at his face

129
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,770
in this morning's paper.

130
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm sure he's still contemplating

131
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,270
whether he should take me on or not.

132
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,470
But he'll come.

133
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,470
To live up to his name, Moonlight Magician.

134
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,070
I'll see you, then.

135
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,270
I've got to make final adjustments

136
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,370
on the strategy with my staff, you see.

137
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,170
Hey, wait!

138
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,270
Hey! What strategy?

139
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,570
What's this?

140
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,670
Here he comes!

141
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,770
-It's Kid! -Kid!

142
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,770
Thief Kid!

143
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,470
How daring and bold indeed!

144
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,870
Thief Kid has finally appeared over the skies of Ginza

145
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,670
displaying his mysterious white-wings!

146
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,670
Darling Thief Kid, I'm over here!

147
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,370
There's a propeller attached behind the hang glider?

148
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,070
Oh no!

149
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,020
Darling Thief Kid?

150
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,920
Where is he?

151
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Thief

152
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Kid!

153
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,120
Wow! What a guy to jump down from a place like that.

154
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,920
He's almost like superman.

155
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,820
No. All he did was explode the radio controlled dummy,

156
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,120
and while everyone's eyes were distracted,

157
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,320
he made his way out of the crowd

158
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,620
and jumped onto the exhibition stand.

159
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:42,420
Kid...

160
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,620
Thief Kid, any comments?

161
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,120
Please, one word will do!

162
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,420
Thief Kid!

163
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,820
Oh, then please relay my message to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.

164
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
This case is a bolt out of the blue for me.

165
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,420
Therefore, I didn't have much time to prepare.

166
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,620
As a result, to please forgive me

167
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,620
for not being able to send out the usual letter warning.

168
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Okay, now!

169
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,420
Oh, it's a net.

170
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,420
The intersection blocked off with a gigantic square net!

171
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,820
Uncle Jirokichi really goes all out.

172
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,320
Height of almost 20 meters.

173
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,920
Unless you do so on a hot air balloon or something,

174
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,820
it's impossible to make it through this net.

175
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,220
How about it?

176
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,420
Even if you were to use a hot air balloon or something,

177
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,820
the helicopters in the sky would get in your way.

178
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,020
Of course, if you plan to escape from among the crowd,

179
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,820
I won't stop you.

180
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,420
When you try to make it over the net,

181
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,320
my staff will make a thorough check.

182
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,620
If you have the mule on you at that time, that's it for you.

183
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,320
If you let go of it, you fail to carry out your crime.

184
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Either way, I win!

185
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,120
Kid, disguise yourself as me and flee.

186
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
You can disguise yourself as me if you like too, Kid!

187
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,320
No need to worry,

188
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,420
I had it figured out that it would turn out this way to begin with.

189
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,620
Then, just what do you intend to do?

190
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,820
Well, since I've done my job and all,

191
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,220
I guess I'll head home.

192
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,520
I mean, how?

193
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Teleportation.

194
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,020
What... what did he just say?

195
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,120
-Teleportation? -Teleportation?

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,720
Teleportation.

197
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,620
He's going to transport himself instantaneously and flee?

198
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,370
Teleportation.

199
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,770
What... what did he just say?

200
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,470
-Teleportation? -Teleportation?

201
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,270
Teleportation?

202
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,270
Fantastic.

203
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,570
Kid is great!

204
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,370
He's going to do it? Thief Kid is going to teleport himself!

205
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,970
He's going to transport himself instantaneously and flee?

206
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,370
That punk. He is doing ridiculous things again!

207
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,670
This is really going to be something.

208
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,170
Thief Kid has suddenly declared that he wills teleport himself.

209
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,270
Will Thief Kid

210
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,970
really make it through the net set up to capture him?

211
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:46,570
Kid...

212
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,770
What now, sir?

213
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,970
What shall we do?

214
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,070
Come on, calm down.

215
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,570
Take a good look at the circumstance.

216
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,570
He's surrounded in all four directions by the net,

217
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,570
and can't even fly off on his prized hang glider.

218
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,670
He's nailed to the ground.

219
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,670
Teleportation, what a laugh.

220
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,670
As you can see, I've got the legendary mule, "Purple Nail"

221
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,570
with me right here.

222
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,970
How dare you, Thief Kid!

223
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,670
Don't you move!

224
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,570
Then, I'll see you again a few seconds later

225
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,470
after I cross through time-space.

226
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,270
Thief Kid!

227
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,870
He vanished?

228
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,270
He really vanished!

229
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,370
Could it indeed be teleportation?

230
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,370
No, all he did was mingle in the crowd along with the smoke.

231
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,170
You can't call that teleportation, can you?

232
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,070
The GPS.

233
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,570
What's the location GPS

234
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,870
that was attached to the dummy mule?

235
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,270
It's moving in the direction of 3-chome from the intersection.

236
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,370
Okay, dispatch security guards

237
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,070
in the direction of the net towards 3-chome.

238
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,170
Rather, reinforce guard of all the nets!

239
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,770
Yes, sir!

240
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,870
Now, he's a cornered rat.

241
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,570
I'll get him even if he tries

242
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,570
to use his cheap tricks to get away.

243
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,270
And, where is he?

244
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,270
Well, he suddenly changed directions

245
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,570
and is running around here and there

246
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,370
and everywhere within the intersection, like a weasel!

247
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,970
Don't be ridiculous!

248
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,770
How can he do something like this among this crowd?

249
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,570
Where on earth is Thief Kid?

250
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,170
This is the mark of Thief Kid.

251
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,370
Where did it come from?

252
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,070
Stuck on the upper left is the GPS.

253
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,270
On the backside...

254
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,070
"Three"?

255
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,270
I caught a Thief Kid card!

256
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,670
Hey, something's written on the back.

257
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,570
Really? "Two"?

258
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,370
"One".

259
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,370
No way.

260
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,470
Can't be?

261
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,070
The roof?

262
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,870
It's Thief Kid.

263
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,770
Thief Kid's suddenly appeared on the roof of a building.

264
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,470
You're great, you're incredible, darling Thief Kid.

265
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,170
Indeed...

266
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,670
He teleported over to a place like that.

267
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,470
That's his double.

268
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,170
I'm sure that it's just that his double,

269
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,270
who was hiding on the roof of the building to begin with appeared.

270
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,770
The real Thief Kid is still among the crowd.

271
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,170
Don't undo the net blocker until you catch him.

272
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,470
Please relay to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki that

273
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,470
I definitely got hold of the gift he sent me,

274
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,470
but unfortunately, one of them turned out to be imitation.

275
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,070
I will return the imitation to you,

276
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,270
so if at all possible,

277
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,070
I'd appreciate it if you would please tell him

278
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,870
to bring the other pair here again tomorrow.

279
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,570
I would like to give the mules to the woman I love,

280
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,970
but giving her just one of a pair of this

281
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,570
would surely upset her, you see.

282
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,070
So long.

283
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,270
What?

284
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,070
He said he's going to come to steal the treasure tomorrow night again?

285
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,370
Did Kid really say that?

286
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,770
Yeah, he said so right in front of the TV camera.

287
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,470
He said that he'll leave the imitation behind,

288
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,070
so bring the real one tomorrow night to the same place.

289
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,770
That's what he said.

290
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,070
But, uncle,

291
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,870
why didn't you exhibit imitations of both sides to begin with?

292
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,870
If I did so, all he would do is throw both sides out and flee, right?

293
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,470
It wouldn't be my victory then, would it?

294
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,770
Then, the least you could do was attaching a GPS.

295
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,770
That way,

296
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,270
we could've at least figured out how he got to the roof.

297
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,970
Of course a GPS was attached.

298
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,670
But, he seems to have removed it along the way.

299
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,370
Isn't this the GPS you're talking about?

300
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,670
Pops picked it up at that intersection.

301
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,670
Something's stuck on to it with tape.

302
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,670
This is indeed the GPS I attached to the dummy.

303
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,470
When did you get this?

304
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,170
It came falling from the sky about 5-6 seconds

305
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,770
before he appeared by teleportation.

306
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,770
There were two others besides that one, right?

307
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,470
Right, it came falling in the order

308
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,270
three, two,

309
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,770
and one as written on the back of the card.

310
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,770
Right after card number 1, Thief Kid appeared on the roof!

311
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,870
In other words,

312
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,570
he quickly attached the GPS that he found to the cards

313
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,070
that he was planning to scatter to begin with as part of his show.

314
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,870
Which means that when he scattered the cards,

315
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,870
Kid was on the roof.

316
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,270
If he were to throw the cards from among the crowd,

317
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,070
someone is bound to have noticed.

318
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,870
How did he get up on the roof in an instant anyway?

319
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,670
Maybe simply by using the elevator of that building.

320
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,870
Impossible.

321
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,370
I rented the buildings on all four corners

322
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,470
of the intersection for an entire day

323
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,770
and sealed off all the entrances and exits there are.

324
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,770
You rented the buildings?

325
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,970
Besides, even if he did get into the building,

326
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,470
it would take him close to a minute

327
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,970
to get to the roof with the elevator.

328
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,370
But...

329
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,270
if it's only the mules,

330
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,070
wouldn't it be possible to take them to the roof?

331
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,770
Kid has one accomplice, doesn't he?

332
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,570
If Kid and his accomplice does it

333
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,670
right on the roof and on the ground.

334
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,870
I see!

335
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,970
He could've suspended a fishing line

336
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,870
or something beforehand from the roof

337
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,270
then the guy on the ground who stole the mule ties it onto the line.

338
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,270
Finally the guy who is hiding on the roof pulls it up.

339
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,670
It'll look as if he indeed teleported.

340
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,870
Yeah. If only the mules,

341
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,370
all that is needed is a fishing reel

342
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,970
to pull them up in seconds.

343
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,370
No, not only the mules.

344
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,370
Hey. Come inside and explain.

345
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,070
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,370
I'm one of the 4 guards that was positioned around the stand

347
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,670
that the mules were exhibited.

348
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,870
You remember when Thief Kid first got here

349
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,570
the crowd stampeded over, right?

350
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,670
Yeah.

351
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,770
There was a person who was holding a hamburger in the crowd

352
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,070
and when I blocked the movement of that person,

353
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,070
back then, I unfortunately got ketchup on my hands.

354
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,070
I happened to grab Thief Kid's cape

355
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,970
with my ketchup smeared hands right before he vanished.

356
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,770
And since you had ketchup smeared slippery hands,

357
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,170
he got away?

358
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,270
Oh, no. Well, you see...

359
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,670
Take a look at this.

360
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,470
One of it is imitation...

361
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,170
This is the image of him saying that

362
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,770
he's going to come steal again tomorrow.

363
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,770
If possible I will come back here again, tomorrow.

364
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,570
Watch this!

365
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,370
Can't you tell?

366
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,170
To the left edge of the screen.

367
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,070
It's a cape fluttering in the wind.

368
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,270
The red outline of a hand print.

369
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,670
Is this the trace this guard left behind?

370
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,470
Even he couldn't have foreseen such a happening.

371
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,670
This means that the one who appeared on the roof

372
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,670
is the one who first landed on the ground.

373
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,170
It's Thief Kid, the one and the same person.

374
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,070
He actually moved from one place to the other

375
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,970
in less than 20 seconds

376
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,870
to that place 30 meters above ground.

377
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,540
Did you see Thief Kid last night?

378
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,840
I saw him! I saw him! He was on TV!

379
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,440
Kid's teleportation was really awesome, wasn't it?

380
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,940
Yep! He's going to come and teleport again tonight, right?

381
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm really excited already.

382
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,540
Right. He disappears from the middle of an intersection

383
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,640
and the next minute he appears

384
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,240
like a bolt out of the blue on the roof of a building.

385
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,440
Maybe Thief Kid has psychic powers?

386
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,340
He doesn't have ESP.

387
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,240
He's just a thief that uses a bit of magic.

388
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,040
Oh, then have you figured out how he does his magic?

389
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,940
You were there at the intersection

390
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,240
where Thief Kid was too, weren't you, Conan?

391
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,340
Yeah. Well, I guess I was,

392
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,240
but I haven't figured out how he did it yet.

393
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,040
Could it be that there were two Thief Kids?

394
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,340
One of them was on the ground,

395
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,840
stole the treasured mule and vanished,

396
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,040
then the other one who was hiding on the roof appears later.

397
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,340
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

398
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,040
Not possible.

399
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,940
The guard who was protecting the exhibition stand

400
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,940
happened to put his handprint on Kid's cape just before he disappeared

401
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,940
and that handprint was found on the cape of Kid who appeared on the roof.

402
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,140
The mule that he gave the TV reporter was unmistakably

403
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,840
the replica that Jirokichi Suzuki had made.

404
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,940
It could be that Kid has a twin brother.

405
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,040
That's possible.

406
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,340
If so, that's really something.

407
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,640
They're not listening to me.

408
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,340
Well, but it's for sure that he displayed a miracle.

409
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,040
He vanished in the middle of an intersection surrounded by a net

410
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,140
in front of a large crowd of people.

411
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,440
And in a matter of only 20 seconds

412
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,840
he moved to the roof of a nearby building.

413
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,740
Yeah. It's true that it seems humanly impossible.

414
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,440
But if look at it from a different view,

415
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,440
he needed almost 20 seconds to make his move.

416
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,940
I'll figure out the mystery of the 20 seconds no matter what,

417
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,840
and reveal how he carried out his teleportation trick.

418
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,740
You look to be enjoying yourself.

419
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,540
You look just like a child ready to open a gift box

420
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,040
that was given to him.

421
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,840
But, be careful.

422
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,540
After all, he's the Moonlight Magician, Thief Kid.

423
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
He's already displaying that

424
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,440
he's not fretting by appearing at night

425
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,440
wearing a conspicuous white outfit.

426
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,840
Yeah. I know.

427
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,340
Hey, I mean they're already blocking the place off

428
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,740
even before Thief Kid's appearance.

429
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,640
They're not letting the general public inside either.

430
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Now that you mentioned it,

431
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Uncle Jirokichi seems to have shut out the TV staff

432
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,640
who were doing a live broadcast too.

433
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,340
That only man really goes all out.

434
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,140
Well, Inspector Nakamori, I really appreciate your cooperation.

435
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,440
No problem at all.

436
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
With my staff and the police department teaming up,

437
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,840
it'll be a cinch.

438
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,940
You should've done this to begin with.

439
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,740
Come on, Thief Kid! Let me see you teleport yourself.

440
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,640
I shall surely tonight,

441
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,240
in clear view of everything and everyone capture you

442
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,140
and insert this glorious even into the last chapter of my autobiography.

443
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,240
I will cover the front pages of the papers

444
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,040
with articles of my brave and glorious deed.

445
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,240
That old man's still hung up on something like that.

446
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
I will return this to you,

447
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,240
so if possible I will come back here tomorrow night.

448
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,040
Darling Thief Kid.

449
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,740
Oh, is this yesterday's live broadcast?

450
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,840
Yes, I'm watching the video

451
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
of darling Thief Kid's white outfit

452
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,340
while waiting because I have nothing better to do.

453
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,640
I've been wondering from some time ago,

454
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,040
but I wonder why Thief Kid always dresses in white?

455
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,840
I mean, he always appears at night so I would think that black

456
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,940
would be way more inconspicuous and better for him.

457
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,640
Why else? It's because darling Thief Kid

458
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,140
is daring and fearless as well as graceful!

459
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,940
Never mind that, but is that thief really going to show up?

460
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,140
What a stupid thing to say.

461
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,840
There was never a time before

462
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,040
that Thief Kid didn't show up after giving out a warning.

463
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,640
What's that?

464
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,140
A parachute?

465
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,340
Good evening everyone, this is Thief Kid!

466
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,640
I hate to say this when you've all gathered here like this,

467
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,040
but I'd like to cancel tonight's magic show.

468
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,940
What... what did he say?

469
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,640
I would like to perform my magic show for all of you,

470
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,340
however, there are no spectators or TV cameras

471
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,440
to watch me closely.

472
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,140
Under this bland circumstance, I can't seem to raise my adrenalin level.

473
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,740
Therefore, goodbye everyone.

474
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,540
No way. Kid isn't coming?

475
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,740
What the heck? I left my office early for this!

476
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,940
Let us into the net!

477
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,740
Yeah, let us in!

478
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Let us in...

479
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,640
Inspector, there's a person who says

480
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,840
he saw someone fire a queer looking gun.

481
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
What?

482
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,340
You mean Thief Kid is somewhere among this crowd?

483
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,340
Find him! He still around here somewhere!

484
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,840
Right, he scattered cards out last night too,

485
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,040
just before appearing on the roof.

486
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,140
They came falling 5 to 6 seconds before he appeared

487
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,540
so he should've fired a little before that.

488
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,040
Since no one saw him back then,

489
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
he would've had to leave the ground

490
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,040
approximately 10 seconds after vanishing.

491
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,040
But, 10 seconds is only just enough to weave through the crowd

492
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,640
and make it below the building he teleported himself to.

493
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,340
Moreover, he flew three cards in a row.

494
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,640
If he was inside a building or hiding,

495
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,040
he couldn't have done something like that.

496
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,140
Going to the roof without hiding

497
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,340
or being seen by anyone in a short amount of time.

498
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
Is it really possible?

499
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,940
Let us in...

500
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,840
Hey, Kid wants spectators to watch him!

501
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,140
Let's all break inside!

502
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,340
Hey, wait.

503
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,340
Inspector, are you okay?

504
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,740
For Christ's sake.

505
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:31,040
Kid...

506
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,440
Inspector, the TV crew

507
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,840
is firing at us like arrows demanding to be let it.

508
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,940
What?

509
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,140
Ignore them. Ignore them!

510
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,240
No, I think you've got no choice but to let them through.

511
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,140
Unless Kid comes, we can't even capture him, can we?

512
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,540
Viewers out there,

513
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,640
we just got the green light to resume our live broadcast!

514
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,940
We, the crew of Nichiuri TV

515
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,140
will like we did last night,

516
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
will go up to the roof where Thief Kid teleported to

517
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,540
and bring to you live all that happens.

518
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,940
So, let's wait for Thief Kid to appear.

519
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,340
Wow, they're resuming live broadcast.

520
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,440
Where's Conan?

521
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,740
He deliberately gathered the crowd into the net

522
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,040
and made them resume the live TV broadcast.

523
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,140
Does this mean that

524
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,940
he cannot carry out his trick unless this situation is set up?

525
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,240
Don't move.

526
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,040
Don't move, or you're dead.

527
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,540
Thief Kid.

528
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,650
Don't move.

529
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,650
Don't move, or you're dead.

530
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,050
Thief Kid.

531
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,550
Idiot, you're not scaring me with a toy like that.

532
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,450
Oh, boy. You're a wet blanket kid as always.

533
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,050
None of your business.

534
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,850
Hey, famed detective, do you know

535
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,850
about the 3 principles of Thurston?

536
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,950
Yeah.

537
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,450
The famed magician at the beginning of the 20th Century,

538
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,350
Howard Thurston.

539
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,350
The 3 principles defined in honor of his name,

540
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,050
the three taboos that should never be done

541
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,550
when performing magic, right?

542
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,950
Exactly.

543
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,950
Number 1, a magician should never reveal the trick behind his magic.

544
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,750
This isn't even worth mentioning though.

545
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,750
Number 2 is never explain what will be happening

546
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,050
before you perform your magic.

547
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,350
Because it will decrease the mystery

548
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,350
and kill the suspense of the magic.

549
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,850
Well, number 3

550
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,550
is never repeat the same magic twice.

551
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,750
Performing the magic once

552
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,350
will leave a strong impression and beautify the magic

553
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,850
as the greatest magic on earth into the hearts of the viewers.

554
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,650
But, performing it again, will urge the viewers to seek

555
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,050
what the trick behind the magic is than to enjoy what is happening.

556
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,650
The possibility of the trick being figured out will also increase.

557
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,850
I see.

558
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,750
In other words,

559
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,250
if you go ahead with the taboo,

560
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,150
and people still can't figure out how you did it,

561
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,250
you'll be the world's greatest magician?

562
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,250
Exactly.

563
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,550
Oh, there you are, Conan!

564
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,150
You should stay close by.

565
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,850
He's mingled among the crowd.

566
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,150
Now that there seems to be a great gallery and excitement is rising,

567
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,550
I would like to begin my show soon.

568
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,850
Please enjoy to your heart's content.

569
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,050
All right!

570
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,450
Thief Kid's come!

571
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:56,450
Kid...

572
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,050
The excitement is so great

573
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,750
that it looks as if he's already got hold of his target.

574
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,150
Well, if I, the famed Kogoro Mouri were to directly take charge,

575
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,950
I could take care of that thief hands down.

576
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,250
You know what they call people like you? Big fish in a small pond!

577
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,550
Big fish in a small pond?

578
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,450
In a small pond...

579
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,750
While we wait for Thief Kid to make his appearance,

580
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,650
let's take a look at last night's video tape recording

581
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,450
and examine Thief Kid's teleportation.

582
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,950
Thief Kid who arrived over the skies of Ginza on his hang glider

583
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,950
-and the next instant, was standing... -How exciting!

584
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,950
-on the exhibition stand -Yes.

585
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,250
vanished along with the smoke.

586
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,150
And, Thief Kid gets a hold

587
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,350
of the legendary mules, "Purple Nail".

588
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:41,450
However, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki's strategy,

589
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,750
includes blocking off the four corners of the intersection with a net

590
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,050
and sealing the place off completely.

591
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,650
"Osaka" -Despite this impossible to escape situation,

592
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,550
Thief Kid had declared with composure

593
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,250
that he will escape with teleportation.

594
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,450
Yes, this is Hattori.

595
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,450
Oh, Mr. Otaki of the Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

596
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,550
What's up?

597
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,250
I'm watching TV and it's coming to the best part now.

598
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,950
There's a case you want me to handle?

599
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,850
Yeah.

600
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,650
Yeah.

601
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,050
Centipede?

602
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,050
Thief Kid, who vanished from the exhibit stand along with smoke

603
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,650
and only about 20 seconds later,

604
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,350
-appears on the roof... -Let me take a good look at it.

605
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,350
of a department store 30 meters from ground.

606
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,050
A miracle indeed!

607
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,550
This is...

608
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,050
"Looking for favorite women!"

609
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,550
I wonder where Kid's going to teleport to today?

610
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,650
Beats me. I'm sure he's going to avoid teleporting

611
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,850
to the same building as yesterday, though.

612
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,650
Maybe he'll teleport to that helicopter!

613
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,450
I doubt it!

614
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,150
Wanna go see?

615
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,150
-What? -What?

616
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,750
I know where Thief Kid's going to teleport tonight.

617
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,150
What? Are you serious?

618
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,750
Where will he go, Conan?

619
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,450
Like Sonoko just said,

620
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,850
to one of the helicopters flying up there.

621
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,350
-Not. -Remember the time

622
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,250
Kid walked in mid air?

623
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,650
At that time he was suspended from a helicopter

624
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,650
that one of his friend's who was flying, right?

625
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,550
So, when he moved from one place to the next last night,

626
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,650
his friend pulled him up from above

627
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,050
and then put him down on the roof of the department store.

628
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,050
That's why it looked just like he teleported.

629
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,750
Come off it, stupid! No way!

630
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,550
Because of what happened last time,

631
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,750
Uncle Jirokichi was checking

632
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,650
the pilots of the helicopters with the utmost care.

633
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,650
Besides, unlike yesterday, the helicopters flying today

634
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,250
are police choppers.

635
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,250
Kid's accomplice wouldn't be able to get in that easily.

636
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,250
Besides, take a good look

637
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,350
at the crowd of people around the mules.

638
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,250
There are more than 200 people in that intersection

639
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,150
that is blocked off with a net!

640
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,050
If Kid is lifted up into the air from there,

641
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,350
someone's bound to be watching!

642
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,350
Well, it's no more than the shallow cleverness of a child.

643
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,950
I hate to admit it, but I'm sure Sonoko's right.

644
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,450
I thought I hit upon quite a good idea and then.

645
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,250
I've got to think it over from scratch again I guess.

646
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,850
Kid...

647
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,950
-So, it's nightfall is approaching. -Kid...

648
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,850
Among the crowd who are calling out to Kid,

649
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,450
will Thief Kid, as he did last night

650
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,750
get hold of the legendary mule, Purple Nail

651
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,850
that is placed in the middle of the intersection

652
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,950
and show us as he did last night

653
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,250
that miraculous performance of teleportation?

654
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,950
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid has appeared!

655
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,950
He's come. Darling Thief Kid has come after all!

656
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,950
How dare you. Thief Kid, I'm nabbing you for sure tonight...

657
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,050
Hold it, Inspector Nakamori.

658
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,050
Take a good look at the propeller on the rear.

659
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,850
That's a dummy after all.

660
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,450
I'm sure that just like last night he's going to explode the dummy

661
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,050
and during that time is going to head for the exhibition stand.

662
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,750
So, he's among the crowd somewhere

663
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,050
waiting for the right time to do so.

664
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,350
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

665
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,250
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

666
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,450
Now, just like last night,

667
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,650
please watch to your heart's content

668
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,350
as I teleport through time-space.

669
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,150
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

670
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,450
Hurry up and nab Kid!

671
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,250
If you want to nab me, suit yourself.

672
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,250
However, I warn you, don't ever let go.

673
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,650
Because if you're shaken off while teleporting,

674
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,350
you'll end up drifting through space-time.

675
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,850
Calm down! He's mingled among the crowd, that's all!

676
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,850
He's somewhere nearby, find him!

677
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,150
Hey, did Thief Kid teleport?

678
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,750
I can't see, we've got to go more in front.

679
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,650
Okay on this side. Start.

680
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,850
I wonder if darling Thief Kid is going to teleport over here today?

681
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,950
I wonder where Conan went?

682
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,650
Okay, here goes the first shot.

683
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,650
-It's Kid's card. -Really?

684
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,350
"Three"?

685
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,150
"Two".

686
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,150
"One".

687
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,550
Zero.

688
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,950
Too bad, you're performing tonight's magic show for free.

689
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,250
You get no reward,

690
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,250
Mr. Moonlight Magician.

691
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,720
Too bad, you're performing tonight's magic show for free.

692
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,020
You get no reward,

693
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Mr. Moonlight Magician.

694
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,720
Get rid of the weight! Hurry!

695
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,020
What's this?

696
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,620
It looks like a bag filled with sand.

697
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,820
Where did it come from?

698
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,020
The trick involving teleportation is extremely simple.

699
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,920
The principle of the pulley used in old wells was applied.

700
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Your accomplices disguised among the TV crew

701
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,920
are installing two pulleys on the fence of the roof.

702
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,120
Then a wire with hooks on both ends

703
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,220
is pulled through the pulley.

704
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,420
One side is lowered below the building,

705
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,020
and the other end is hooked onto the body of your accomplice.

706
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,120
All that's left to do is vanish from the exhibition table,

707
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,620
weave through the crowd,

708
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,820
reach the bottom of the building

709
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,320
and attach the hook onto yourself,

710
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,420
which after your accomplice jumps off the building.

711
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,520
If a weight is used on the body of your accomplice

712
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,320
and he is made to be heavier than you,

713
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
by the principle of the pulley

714
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,920
your body will be lifted up to the roof in no time.

715
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,320
Therefore, it will look as if you teleported and appeared.

716
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,620
Since the TV crew are busy with the live broadcast

717
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,820
no one would notice even if one person were to leave

718
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,720
and go over the fence.

719
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,720
The sound of the pulley would be erased by the cheer of the crowd too.

720
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,120
The point is not to let the crowd below

721
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,020
notice the two-people going up and down.

722
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,920
Your accomplice can pass through the large banner over there

723
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,420
but you have to distract the eyes of the crowd from the building.

724
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,320
So, you had to scatter the cards.

725
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,220
Therefore, you could not hide yourself behind the banner.

726
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,620
So, you thought up this text news.

727
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,020
You deceived the eyes of the crowd by taking advantage

728
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,520
of the text moving from below upwards, while you ascended.

729
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,720
I see.

730
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,620
Your deduction that I heard over the wiretap a while ago

731
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,820
was a fake one to catch me off guard.

732
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,720
You already knew about the text news trick.

733
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,620
Yeah, thanks to the "contents" of last night's news.

734
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,720
The news that streamed

735
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,720
by just before you appeared on the roof of the building was

736
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,820
"Looking for favorite women!" (Written in Japanese characters.)

737
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,820
But, that phrase is quite ambiguous, isn't it?

738
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,820
That's when I saw through your trick.

739
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,620
The character that streamed by then was not "daisuki"(favorite)

740
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,120
but rather "inusuki" (dog loving).

741
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
That is, you were dressed in black and moved right along together

742
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,420
with the apostrophe of the character "inu" (dog).

743
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,420
Yes, a black outfit. I've finally figured it out.

744
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,520
The reason why you appear wearing an irrational white coloured outfit

745
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,320
that only makes you more conspicuous to people.

746
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,520
You're neither daring nor fearless.

747
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,720
It's because is easier to hide that way.

748
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,120
People have a tendency to unconsciously look for white things

749
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,920
if they suddenly vanish from before their eyes.

750
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,320
But, a quick change from white to black

751
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,020
will easily deceive the vision of others.

752
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,220
Yeah, and at the same time,

753
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:40,020
something white suddenly appearing from the dark...

754
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,420
is also mysterious, isn't it?

755
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Hey, isn't that Thief Kid?

756
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,920
He's standing on the wall of a building!

757
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,820
The place Thief Kid teleported to tonight

758
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,320
is... What a surprise! On the digital bulletin board!

759
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,620
He's defying gravity and standing perpendicularly on the wall.

760
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,620
-No way. -No joke.

761
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,420
Darling Thief Kid, you're awesome.

762
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,820
Well, give yourself in.

763
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,820
If you go all the way up like this, you may be saved,

764
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,320
but your accomplice who is lowered to the ground

765
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,520
will be arrested by the police.

766
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,820
If the reverse happens, that's it for you.

767
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,220
Kid!

768
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,820
I'm not letting you get away!

769
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
I'll see you in the center then.

770
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,920
Center?

771
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,020
Give me your hand!

772
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,520
He made it through the net in the nick of time.

773
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,320
"Given that these aren't quite the jewels I was after,"

774
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,920
"I relinquish them to you. By Theif Kid"

775
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,920
That rat.

776
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,220
You really did a good job last night, Conan.

777
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,620
It's amazing how you got inside the building.

778
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,020
I'm a kid, so I get to skitter around here and there.

779
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,320
Well, I did put the security guard to sleep

780
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,420
with my tranquilizer gun, though.

781
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,420
It's in the morning papers.

782
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,020
"Great Victory for Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki!"

783
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,520
I'm sure that gramps can sleep well to his heart content from today.

784
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,820
Look at the big picture of his face too.

785
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,020
I wonder about that.

786
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,520
My face is on the side.

787
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,520
Next Conan's Hint:

788
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,500
"Centipede"

789
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,040
I'm appearing in the next episode!

790
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,780
Heiji, me, too!

791
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,040
Oh, yeah.
