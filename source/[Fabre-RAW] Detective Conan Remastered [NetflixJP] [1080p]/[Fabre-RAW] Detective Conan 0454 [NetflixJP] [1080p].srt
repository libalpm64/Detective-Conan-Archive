1
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:03,979
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:05,979
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:07,279
The children are playing baseball and the ball flies into a house.

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,779
Where objects are toppled upside down and a man is killed.

5
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,479
Something about his room is not right!

6
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,079
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,679
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,979
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:14,183
Sensei!

10
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:15,183
Yeah.

11
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:17,883
Hi, Editor Shimaki.

12
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:21,383
What do you mean, "Hi, Shimaki"?

13
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:24,583
And what is it you want?

14
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,683
Just what're you talking about, Sensei?

15
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:28,883
Just joking, I'm just joking.

16
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,683
Please, come on.

17
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:31,983
You want the manuscript, don't you?

18
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,983
Yes! Yes, Manda Sensei.

19
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:38,683
Please stop joking with me and give it to me,

20
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,383
I'm really in a fix.

21
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:42,983
Yeah.

22
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:47,183
The printers are saying they can only wait for another two hours.

23
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:50,983
Yeah. Two hours is more than enough.

24
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,583
Two hours?

25
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,383
All I have left to do is to write the final plot,

26
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,883
then write the epilogue, so it's no big deal.

27
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,283
Really?

28
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:02,683
Yes, really. Please trust me.

29
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,183
You've know me for a long time, haven't you?

30
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,883
Hey, Nobel.

31
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:13,683
Please watch Sensei so that he doesn't run out on me!

32
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:14,883
I'm counting on you!

33
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:18,883
If he tries to run away, you can go ahead and bite him.

34
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:24,683
Okay, I'll be waiting at that elevator hall.

35
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,183
So, let me know when you're done!

36
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:28,183
Okay.

37
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,583
I know.

38
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:16,883
"Result of the Tumble (Part 1)"

39
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,983
Yes, in another two hours.

40
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:53,083
Yes, he says it'll be finished.

41
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,083
Yes, Sensei himself is saying so, therefore, please...

42
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,683
I think he'll be done too.

43
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:01,883
Yes, please don't worry, I'll make sure he writes it.

44
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,983
Teitan Elementary School 1st grade Class B,

45
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:24,283
"Towel Prince" Genta Kojima, facing a no-hit no run.

46
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:31,983
Two-out and bases loaded! Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya is doing just great.

47
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,183
Here goes the first pitch.

48
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,183
I got him.

49
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,983
I did it.

50
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:46,883
We're counting on you, Edogawa.

51
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:49,183
What do you mean you're counting on me? Hey.

52
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,883
The ball! The ball!

53
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,183
All right!

54
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,983
You can count on me.

55
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,883
I won!

56
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,283
Conan's fantastic.

57
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:15,483
If this were soccer, yes.

58
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:19,783
Take the ball with your glove because this isn't soccer.

59
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:23,383
Conan, don't tell me you're making light of baseball?

60
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,383
He's right, Conan!

61
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:29,083
Play like you should, come on.

62
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,183
Sorry. Sorry.

63
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,583
I can't help it, can I?

64
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,883
It's just a habit from playing soccer

65
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:36,783
that legs respond faster than my hands.

66
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:54,983
Sensei?

67
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:59,283
I've been waiting for you. I was really looking forward to seeing you.

68
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:00,783
Manda Sensei.

69
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,483
What's with that outfit of yours?

70
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:06,383
Don't tell me you disguised yourself as a bellboy

71
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,783
and escaped from the hotel again?

72
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,183
You never learn, do you?

73
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,883
Yeah.

74
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,783
Because I was confined.

75
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,183
This is the fastest, easiest way to get free.

76
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:23,983
No one notices me this way.

77
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:26,683
Nobel is with you.

78
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,983
Nobel! Nobel!

79
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,783
Oh, that a boy.

80
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,683
It's me!

81
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,883
If neither of us, you or me aren't around,

82
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:38,883
he may go berserk and hurt himself badly.

83
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:42,083
Huh?

84
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
Never mind that,

85
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,383
is it ready? The manuscript.

86
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,183
Yes. I finished it six hours ago.

87
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:52,983
What? Six hours ago?

88
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:56,183
But when I called you from the hotel a while ago,

89
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,983
you said you needed a little more time, didn't you?

90
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:02,883
I was kind of enjoying your panicky voice that I lied to you.

91
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,183
Please don't be offended.

92
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,583
Hey, hey. Haramoto!

93
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,783
I mean, it's really no big deal, is it?

94
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,983
Because I'm going through quite a bit of stress

95
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:14,183
ghost writing for you too.

96
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:19,083
Of course, in return I will get paid a lot.

97
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,683
So, I don't really have any complaints.

98
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,683
Here you go!

99
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,983
Here's the manuscript!

100
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:34,783
I wrote a happy ending to it just like you wanted me to.

101
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:37,183
Thank you.

102
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:42,083
Did you tell them about me already?

103
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,883
After I hand this over to them, I'm going to meet the editor

104
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:48,783
to discuss about the next series at my place.

105
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:52,783
After all that's done, I'll bring the editor over here.

106
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,583
Really? Thank you.

107
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,183
I'm really happy.

108
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:02,683
Well, if you make your debut, it might be time for me to retire.

109
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,183
Don't worry about it.

110
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,983
I'll continue ghost writing for you.

111
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:10,483
What I'll be writing are detective stories that you don't write!

112
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,983
The writing style is also different!

113
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:15,583
Different writing style?

114
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,883
The fact is, it's almost done!

115
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,083
My debut story!

116
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,383
You can look through it if you like.

117
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:28,383
It's written in a style so different from yours.

118
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:31,783
But, with this, I get to join the circle of novelists.

119
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,283
If I become a selling novelist,

120
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,683
I'll get to collect a lot more different things.

121
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:40,183
Come to think of it, you're a collector, aren't you?

122
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:43,083
Yes. I've always liked collecting all kinds of things

123
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,283
since my childhood.

124
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,483
But, the thing I want most now is...

125
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,983
the prize awarded to new writers, the Akutayama Award.

126
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:53,083
You're one of the judges too, aren't you, Sensei?

127
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,983
So I'll be able to win the award, won't I?

128
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:56,983
Unless I get this award,

129
00:09:56,983 --> 00:10:01,283
I won't be able to collect other awards later on!

130
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:06,383
Oh, talking about collecting, I finally found the thing I was lacking!

131
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:07,783
Oh.

132
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:25,883
It really feels good after all to have the entire collection.

133
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:28,583
Well, I'm really happy for you!

134
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:50,183
"In the middle of writing, don't enter!"

135
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,083
Come on, Nobel, let's go home.

136
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,983
Nobel?

137
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:57,783
Nobel? Nobel?

138
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:03,783
Where are you, Nobel?

139
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,283
Come on out!

140
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:13,483
Nobel?

141
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,083
Where are you?

142
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:18,583
My, God.

143
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:23,083
Quick. Quick, to the hotel.

144
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,583
Sensei. Manda Sensei.

145
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,883
I've got to get back to the hotel quickly.

146
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:30,883
Sensei? Sensei?

147
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,183
My alibi won't work...

148
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:35,283
Sensei, Manda Sensei.

149
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:36,783
What shall I do?

150
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:40,183
Sensei? It's two hours already!

151
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,683
What shall I do?

152
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,483
Sensei.

153
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:46,683
Manda Sensei.

154
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:58,687
Sensei, Manda Sensei.

155
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,287
Huh?

156
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,387
Sensei?

157
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,487
Talk about noisy.

158
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:12,787
I finished writing it a while ago, and I'm just checking it now!

159
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:14,487
Oh, I see!

160
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:15,687
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:19,887
I think it's quite a good piece myself, so rest assured.

162
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:20,987
Here you go.

163
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,387
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:25,587
Thank you. Thank you for finishing!

165
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:29,187
By the way, where's Nobel?

166
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,687
He always comes to the door.

167
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,987
Where is he?

168
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:39,587
Oh, he's in the carry bag asleep.

169
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:41,787
In the carry bag?

170
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,587
I guess so.

171
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:48,287
I'll go back to the editor's room and check on the manuscript.

172
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,787
Oh, then why don't you do it here in this room,

173
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:54,687
and send the data to the printers from here?

174
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,587
Wouldn't that be faster?

175
00:12:56,587 --> 00:13:01,187
And while they're doing the printing, you can come to my house

176
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:04,287
and we can talk over arrangements for the next series.

177
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:07,187
Oh, no. Because the next series you'll be writing

178
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,987
is still some time away so...

179
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:12,087
I'm sure you'll like it.

180
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:16,187
The next series is something I've never written on about yet.

181
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,887
A mystery?

182
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,987
You who specialize in historical novels?

183
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,287
Are you joking?

184
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,687
No, I'm not joking. I'll bet I surprised you.

185
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:30,487
I've wanted to try writing a mystery novel at least once,

186
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,687
from some time ago.

187
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,587
I see.

188
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,487
That's something to look forward to.

189
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,487
I'd like to see it soon myself too.

190
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,587
Yes, yes.

191
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:47,587
Sensei, please tell me more in detail about this.

192
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:50,987
Well, I already decided on the character of the detective.

193
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,987
I'll talk more about it when we get to my house.

194
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:58,587
What? Don't keep me in suspense, and tell me about it.

195
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,487
Well, well.

196
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:03,887
Nobel sure is quiet, isn't he?

197
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:05,987
Is he okay?

198
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:08,887
Yeah, I guess.

199
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:12,787
He was running around all afternoon, so I think he got tired.

200
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:14,887
Don't worry.

201
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,387
I guess so.

202
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,587
Wait here a while, will you?

203
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:34,087
It's a little messy so I'll go clean up a bit.

204
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,787
Oh, okay. I'll wait.

205
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,587
Nobel!

206
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,987
Nobel! Nobel!

207
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,687
Nobel!

208
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:01,687
You're back, good boy.

209
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,487
Perfect.

210
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:12,187
The perfect crime has been established.

211
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,587
Right, Nobel?

212
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:19,787
What was that?

213
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:28,087
What that sound just now?

214
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:33,687
It seems as if the glass or something of the house opposite here cracked.

215
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:36,087
It seems like the ball of the children who were playing baseball

216
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:38,287
hit the window and struck it.

217
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,587
What?

218
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,487
Gee.

219
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:45,887
Genta, you really fly the ball too far.

220
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:49,587
Well, I can't help it because it flew away.

221
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:52,587
Tell the ball where to go then.

222
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:57,687
But it's strange, no one is answering.

223
00:15:57,687 --> 00:16:00,787
Maybe the ball hit the head of the owner of this house

224
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:02,087
and he passed out or something?

225
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,087
What?

226
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,687
Even if that were to be the case,

227
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:08,887
we have no way of knowing unless we go inside.

228
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,787
-My... -Huh?

229
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,487
Hey, wait a moment.

230
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,187
Haibara?

231
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,487
It's open after all.

232
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:22,687
Excuse me!

233
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,387
But, it's more like we're intruding.

234
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,587
The room that the ball went inside is...

235
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,787
Hey, Conan!

236
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,887
Are you sure it's okay that we're stepping into the house like this?

237
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:37,087
Conan! We'll be caught for trespassing.

238
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,987
Conan!

239
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,887
Haibara!

240
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:44,987
Let's say we have no other choice. How's that?

241
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,287
We're entering!

242
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,887
Excuse me?

243
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,987
Is anybody home?

244
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,187
Excuse me.

245
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:57,887
We're not suspicious people.

246
00:16:57,887 --> 00:17:01,287
Huh? Something about this room is strange.

247
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,487
Yes. Something sure feels strange.

248
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,687
I wonder what it is.

249
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:08,187
Can't you tell just by looking?

250
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:09,887
Over there!

251
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,487
The mini cars, dolls and books that are lined on the shelf

252
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,887
are almost all toppled and upside down.

253
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,387
Why?

254
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:21,787
Don't tell me...

255
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,887
it's because my ball flew inside here?

256
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,987
Maybe because of that,

257
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:32,687
there was a warp in space and a supernatural phenomenon occurred.

258
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:38,387
Mitsuhiko, something's not right and besides there is no warp.

259
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:40,787
The ball that Genta hit...

260
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:42,287
I'm not going to let you beat me.

261
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:46,687
Here goes Genta! Hit this ball if you can.

262
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,887
No matter what kind of ball it is...

263
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:53,887
-Edogawa! -Conan!

264
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,887
Huh? What?

265
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:58,987
Oh no! This is a big one!

266
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:02,787
Genta really hit the ball hard.

267
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,187
The ball just coincidentally happened to go through

268
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:21,287
the open window of this house, so...

269
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,787
But the sound of something cracking was heard, right?

270
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,587
Maybe the ball hit a flower vase or something that was in the room

271
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:28,587
-and cracked it. -What?

272
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,887
You really think so?

273
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,987
What shall I do if I hit something super expensive?

274
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:38,387
I used up all the allowance I got for New Year's too.

275
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:40,887
Well, the price and all of the object that was hit,

276
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:44,087
we have no choice but to ask the person who lives here, right?

277
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,087
"In the middle of writing, don't enter!"

278
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:48,887
I'm sure the ball flew into that room.

279
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:54,687
That is...

280
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:58,387
only if the person living here...

281
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:07,187
is able to talk.

282
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:21,987
How about it?

283
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,287
Well, unfortunately...

284
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:29,687
From looks of rigor mortis, he seems to have been dead for an hour or two.

285
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:34,887
The cracked pieces that are scattered around the corpse shows that

286
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,787
he was probably hit on the back of the head with a flower vase.

287
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,887
Don't tell me that

288
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:46,387
the ball that I hit struck the flower vase that was on the shelf

289
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,587
and hit that man on the head?

290
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:54,187
Genta.

291
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:57,987
Oh no, what shall I do?

292
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:00,987
What shall I do?

293
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:02,187
Idiot.

294
00:20:02,187 --> 00:20:05,587
You hit the ball just a while ago.

295
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,687
Not an hour or two ago, right?

296
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,887
What shall I do? What shall I do?

297
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:15,887
Besides, your ball seems to have cracked the flower vase over there.

298
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:19,387
Genta, I'm glad!

299
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,087
Saved!

300
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:25,487
Which means someone attacked him from behind?

301
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:28,587
Yeah, he was hit from behind with the flower vase!

302
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:31,587
When he was looking into the drawer of the desk!

303
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:36,487
How can you tell he was looking into the drawer?

304
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,887
See, the border between the drawer and the desk,

305
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,487
it's bent out of shape and tilted, right?

306
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,887
When he was hit from behind,

307
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,387
he fell towards the drawer

308
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,587
and it serves as evidence that his body pushed against it!

309
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,087
People usually open the drawer

310
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:51,887
when they want to look for something in the drawer

311
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:54,787
or take something out of it!

312
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,787
I see.

313
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,687
Just great, Conan.

314
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:00,287
The thing that bothers me is the room next door.

315
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,087
Yeah. The books, mini cars and dolls that are on the shelf

316
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:07,087
have almost all toppled and are upside down.

317
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:11,787
If the killer did that, what did the killer intend to do?

318
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,387
Hey!

319
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:19,787
Just what are you children doing?

320
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:21,887
Mr. Haramoto?

321
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:25,487
Is that Mr. Haramoto lying on the floor there?

322
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,187
Hey, Mr. Haramoto?

323
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:31,187
Haramoto? Mr. Haramoto?

324
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:34,587
Just what are you doing? Hurry and call the police and ambulance.

325
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,687
Yes, sir, right away.

326
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:41,087
Come on, children, out of this room!

327
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,887
Yes, sir.

328
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,287
It's a kitty cat.

329
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:51,187
I wonder where it came in from.

330
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,387
Hi, kitty.

331
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:56,487
Don't touch my cat!

332
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,987
Hurry. Out, out!

333
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:08,287
When the police arrive, make sure you explain what happened.

334
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,287
He doesn't have to talk in that tone of voice.

335
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,687
You're right.

336
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,687
Okay?

337
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:15,787
Yeah. Okay.

338
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,460
Next Conan's Hint:

339
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,820
"Unfinished manuscript"

340
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,780
This is my unfinished manuscript.

341
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,860
Genta, it's completely white.

342
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,200
Didn't I tell you that it was unfinished?
