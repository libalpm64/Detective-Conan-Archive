1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:04,936
"Kamakura"

2
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:07,987
"10:00 am"

3
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:09,989
We'll get to see the famous temple that's surrounded

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,436
by hydrangeas right up this hill.

5
00:00:12,436 --> 00:00:15,736
Really, it's a beautiful sight to see!

6
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,136
Huh?

7
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,636
What the... there aren't any flowers here.

8
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:22,836
That's weird. I wonder where I went wrong.

9
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:24,636
Hey...

10
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,236
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

11
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,736
Saturday nights are for mystery.

12
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,019
The three brothers are unable to understand their parent's love.

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,021
Fight over an inheritance, results in an unfortunate case.

14
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,636
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:45,436
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:47,436
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:34,133
"A Fool's Inheritance"

18
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:40,447
What happened? Are you all right?

19
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,447
Over there!

20
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,149
Hey you! What the heck are you doing over there?

21
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,847
Darn!

22
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,747
Tell me what that gunshot was about!

23
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:58,157
Shut up!

24
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,747
Get out of the way!

25
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,447
Hey, wait!

26
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,247
That's strange.

27
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:24,647
The blood's already dried.

28
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:29,647
It's still warm.

29
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:30,947
Then why...

30
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,747
What's this?

31
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,547
It looks like some sort of crystalline substance.

32
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:41,047
Darn, that guy was quick, he got away.

33
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,747
Hey, brat. What did you find?

34
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:47,147
What the heck is this?

35
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:53,247
The victim is Mr. Hisaemon Yaguchi, 70 years old.

36
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:56,747
He was the owner of this house and was quite wealthy.

37
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:59,947
He was shot directly in the chest and died soon thereafter.

38
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:02,221
It was the fatal shot.

39
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,047
The weapon must be that rifle over there.

40
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,647
And, you all happen to be the witness, right?

41
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,747
Yeah.

42
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:13,247
Geez, what're you doing back in Kamakura again?

43
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,047
Just sightseeing. Sightseeing!

44
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,047
These kids said they wanted to watch the hydrangeas.

45
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,347
Inspector Yokomizo, may I have a moment with you?

46
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,547
Sorry to keep you waiting.

47
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:27,947
Is it true that my dad's dead?

48
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:30,847
Yes. Sorry, and you are?

49
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,847
I'm his oldest son, Rokurou.

50
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,253
What's your occupation?

51
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:36,547
I'm a film director.

52
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:38,047
Film director?

53
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,747
Never heard of one by that name.

54
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,263
Regardless, have you figured out who did it?

55
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,947
Before that, at 6:00 this morning, where were you?

56
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,947
But it was almost 10:00 when we heard the gunshot.

57
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:54,273
He was killed long before that.

58
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:55,547
Really?

59
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,277
Yeah, according to autopsy, his time of death is around...

60
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,547
Hey! Shut up about that!

61
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:01,847
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:05,047
So, the time of death is around 6:00?

63
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:07,447
Then, the gunshot we heard...

64
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:10,289
Was that to throw us off from the actual time of death?

65
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,747
But, even so...

66
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,847
I was in Tokushima.

67
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,347
I went to Tokushima seeking for an interview of my new film.

68
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:20,299
I checked out of the hotel at about half-past 6:00.

69
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,947
And by the time, I made it back to Tokyo, it was already after 10:30.

70
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,747
Oh, that's right.

71
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:28,047
I also kept the stub of my air ticket.

72
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,309
Here you are.

73
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,847
I see.

74
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,047
-Check this out. -Roger.

75
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,547
By the way, did Hisaemon live here alone?

76
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,747
Yeah. He used have servants here looking after him,

77
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:46,047
but he laid them all off a half-year ago.

78
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:50,329
Jeez, to think he'd go this far just to save money.

79
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,747
What a stingy father he was.

80
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:56,347
He decided not to keep servants, despite owning a large house?

81
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:57,847
Do you have any other family members?

82
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,747
Two young brothers.

83
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:04,647
That's right, they may know something about the case.

84
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:08,647
Well, I don't know if they'd tell the truth though.

85
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,947
Hey, we know you're in there.

86
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,347
Get out here right now!

87
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,147
Return the money or else!

88
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,347
Who're you guys?

89
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:26,047
Bug you, or what?

90
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,047
Hey!

91
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:30,647
Our apologies, Big Boss Yokomizo.

92
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,747
You guys still at it?

93
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:35,147
Yeah.

94
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:36,375
-Let's get home! -What?

95
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,947
Just go!

96
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:43,947
Mr. Yaguchi!

97
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,747
Mr. Akihiko Yaguchi.

98
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:48,387
This is the police! We want to talk to you.

99
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,391
"Akihiko Yaguchi (37) Second-born Son"

100
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,947
The police? What do you want?

101
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:00,399
Around 6:00, huh?

102
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,147
I was at the family restaurant.

103
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,347
To get to my dad's house from there,

104
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:09,047
it'd take about an hour even by car.

105
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,147
The money it took to open this shop.

106
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:14,147
Your father was the one who covered it, wasn't he?

107
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:17,447
And even after that, you still received money from him.

108
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:21,247
Until he recently refused to give you any more, isn't that right?

109
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,847
Who told you that?

110
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:25,647
Your elder brother, Rokurou.

111
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:28,427
That jerk, Rokurou.

112
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:32,431
My brother's the one who relied on dad to fund his movies!

113
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:33,747
But since he didn't give him much,

114
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:36,147
he still had to take out loans!

115
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:43,047
Actually, the company I ran went bankrupt recently.

116
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,547
And my father, who had always supported me financially,

117
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:48,447
refused to bail me out just like that.

118
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:52,451
And, let's talk about what you did around 6:00 this morning?

119
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,047
"Kimio Taguchi (32) Third-born Son" -Of course,

120
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,847
I was still as sleep around 6:00.

121
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,447
Really?

122
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:01,447
That's true.

123
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,647
Actually, prior to the incident,

124
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,447
there was someone who witnessed you at the scene.

125
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,475
Care to explain that?

126
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,477
Well... that's for... I mean...

127
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,479
-Say it! -Yes.

128
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,047
I went to my father's house.

129
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:24,483
What for?

130
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,047
For the money...

131
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,247
With good intentions? The early in the morning?

132
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,947
No. I tried to steal some...

133
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:32,947
But...

134
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,847
It isn't like I heard.

135
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,947
I can't get this safe opened.

136
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,447
Darn!

137
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,147
Don't move!

138
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,747
Who the heck are you?

139
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,047
Kimio?

140
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,947
What a pathetic man you are!

141
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,047
To think you would act like a thief.

142
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,547
I just did what Akihiko asked me.

143
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,647
Akihiko, you say?

144
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,547
Darn it, you're forever a greenhorn!

145
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,847
No! I'm not a greenhorn!

146
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,847
It's the truth. Please believe me!

147
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,147
After that, I went to see my brother Akihiko.

148
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,547
Well? How'd it go?

149
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,547
Dad caught me stealing.

150
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:21,647
You moron!

151
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:24,247
I even worked out the plan on how to do it!

152
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,347
Worked out the plan?

153
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,247
What I saw wasn't what we expected at all!

154
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,347
Dad's safe was so sturdy, there was no way to...

155
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,547
A safe?

156
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:32,347
You didn't know?

157
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:36,147
Dad, an old fox! When'd he buy such a safe?

158
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:38,557
Fine. I'll do it.

159
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,559
-You still want to steal it? -Of course!

160
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,247
I'll give you a portion of the green to shut you up.

161
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,647
All right.

162
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:47,847
If that safe is really that sturdy,

163
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,947
I've gotta prepare some tools.

164
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:56,247
That was at 6:00 this morning.

165
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:06,585
Darn, to think you two were going to rob from dad!

166
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,587
It's Akihiko who told me to do it.

167
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:09,847
Don't blame me!

168
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,247
But you really did!

169
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,591
What? Disbanding right now?

170
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,593
Be quiet!

171
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,947
Akihiko,

172
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:20,247
until 5:45 this morning, you claimed you were in a family restaurant.

173
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:23,947
This has since been confirmed by the waitress and several customers.

174
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,847
Yeah, of course.

175
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:30,047
Afterwards, you went to a discount shop nearby to buy some items?

176
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:34,147
A crowbar, an electric drill.

177
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:37,447
A number of witnesses confirmed this for us.

178
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,547
I remembered, too.

179
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,747
Look at your right hand.

180
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:44,623
This is...

181
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,947
Fine, I did come to steal.

182
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,047
But I didn't kill dad!

183
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,629
When I arrived, dad was already...

184
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,247
What the...

185
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:56,047
Who did this?

186
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,947
But, this is my chance.

187
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:04,047
It really was a strong safe, though.

188
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,347
I tried my best and still couldn't get it open.

189
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,447
And...

190
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,147
How's this?

191
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:15,147
Then, the gunshot we heard at that time was...

192
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:18,657
Yeah, it was me but the shotgun couldn't beat that safe.

193
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,547
The time of death was around 6:00 this morning.

194
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,947
At that time.

195
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:26,147
The oldest brother, Rokurou, was in Tokushima,

196
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:29,247
while Akihiko, the second youngest brother and Kimio, the youngest

197
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:33,047
were at a family restaurant, an hour's drive away by car from here.

198
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:36,675
Hisaemon was shot at close range.

199
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:39,147
After seeing the culprit wielding a rifle before his eyes,

200
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:41,647
why didn't he try to escape?

201
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:45,447
And then the white crystalline substance.

202
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:49,647
Just what was that, anyway?

203
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,699
Now then.

204
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,038
Aside from the body,

205
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:05,038
what else do you notice?

206
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:07,238
Is something missing?

207
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,038
Now that you mention it...

208
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,538
Oh, yes.

209
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,238
Dad's antique collections are gone!

210
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:15,438
Yeah.

211
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:18,738
Faugh. I'd bet it was our older brother that snatched them, right?

212
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,138
What'd you say?

213
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:23,738
I bet you stole them when you come to break into the safe!

214
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:29,138
The victim recently discontinued financial aid for his sons.

215
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:32,238
He also dismissed his servants six months ago.

216
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,338
And then his antiques were gone.

217
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,735
Could it be...

218
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,138
Then, that safe is...

219
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:45,038
By the way, we found this item in this room.

220
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:48,038
It appears to be a webcam.

221
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:50,438
Who planted that thing?

222
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,438
You're a pro when it comes to cameras, big bro?

223
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,638
What's this?

224
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:55,238
Are you saying I did that?

225
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,538
Inspector.

226
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,538
I see.

227
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,538
Everyone, we've come cross further information,

228
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,538
so please come back over to other room again.

229
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,238
By the way, officer.

230
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:08,767
Can you open that safe for us?

231
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,769
Can you try something?

232
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,338
This?

233
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,775
In this position.

234
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:24,138
-Say, Mr. officer. -What?

235
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,138
Where was that stuffed eagle originally?

236
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:30,538
Let's see. Right over there.

237
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:32,538
See that dust mark?

238
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,793
I think the eagle was placed here.

239
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,797
And fell off while the victim was struggling with the culprit?

240
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:42,801
Rokurou, I have received a report

241
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,803
from the Tokushima Police Department.

242
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,807
How was it? I was in Tokushima staying at a hotel, right?

243
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,638
Well, it was witnessed that a man

244
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:54,138
wearing a hat and sunglasses like yours was there.

245
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:56,538
Yeah, you mean me.

246
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:58,838
Well, how should I know?

247
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,638
I heard the guest refused to remove his hat and sunglasses

248
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:04,438
even while inside his room.

249
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,838
That's because this is my trademark style.

250
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:08,438
I don't take these off in front of people!

251
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,538
But, since no one saw your face,

252
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:14,538
we can't say that guest was you, can we?

253
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:15,738
No way.

254
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:19,538
Also, that guest's checkout time was until tomorrow.

255
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:23,238
But he suddenly decided to leave this morning, I heard.

256
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:27,838
Perhaps he already knew that Hisaemon was dead at that time.

257
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:31,638
This morning in a haste, that must be it.

258
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,853
The loans you borrowed were huge.

259
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,838
However, you said you had already secured a way

260
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,538
to pay off all these debits.

261
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:43,238
-That's... -So big bro, you really did kill dad?

262
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:44,238
Absolutely no!

263
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:45,738
So, the person who went to Tokushima

264
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:48,867
was a double that you hired?

265
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:53,538
And then you used that online webcam to monitor this study.

266
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:56,875
In order to obtain the code for the safe.

267
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,138
I see.

268
00:14:58,138 --> 00:15:02,238
You saw Kimio attempt his robbery over that camera.

269
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:04,238
And decided to kill Hisaemon

270
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:08,638
and frame Kimio for it.

271
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,889
Because even if you couldn't open the safe,

272
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,891
you could inherit more this way.

273
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,238
-Big bro! -I knew it.

274
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:16,895
That's complete nonsense!

275
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:20,238
You broke into the house this morning,

276
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:23,238
and killed Hisaemon in this study.

277
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,838
Since there aren't any neighboring houses nearby,

278
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:29,338
there was no one around to hear the gunshot.

279
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:32,638
Then, you ordered your double to return

280
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:35,538
and hand over the ticket stub to you.

281
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:38,138
That way, you could appear here as if nothing happened!

282
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,038
Guess right?

283
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:42,921
No! Absolutely wrong guess!

284
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,923
Where the heck are we wrong?

285
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,925
Come right out, spit it out already!

286
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,238
Dad?

287
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:58,937
Rokurou, I advise you to tell the truth for your own-sake.

288
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:02,038
If you don't, you'll be made the culprit by mistake.

289
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,638
-What did you say? -What?

290
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:08,738
Hisaemon's death was actually an unfortunate accident.

291
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,938
Right?

292
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,338
What do you mean by "accident"?

293
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,538
Recall the position where the body fell.

294
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:19,338
Judging from that position,

295
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,538
when Hisaemon was shot,

296
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:24,538
he would be standing about a foot away from the shelf,

297
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:28,038
facing the wall.

298
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:30,438
It isn't possible to stand in front of him

299
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:33,938
and shoot him in the chest like that.

300
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:38,977
Also, consider the stuffed eagle that fell next to the victim's foot.

301
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:42,981
And that branch the eagle was perched on, it was broken.

302
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,983
So it was, but what does that mean?

303
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:49,338
Rokurou, you actually witnessed the entire scene, didn't you?

304
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:52,438
On that webcam of yours.

305
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:56,638
Yeah, yes, it's true.

306
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:59,338
I saw everything.

307
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:02,238
Seeing is believing.

308
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:09,007
Look. This is the truth.

309
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:15,013
After Kimio fled,

310
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:19,017
dad sat there like that for a while.

311
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:19,838
What's...

312
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,038
Does anything occur as attacks?

313
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:29,438
So the trigger got tangled on the eagle's branch

314
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,338
and caused the gun to misfire.

315
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:33,538
That's correct.

316
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:36,438
The way dad died wasn't by murder.

317
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:37,938
It was an accident.

318
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:40,138
Hey you! If you had this on video all along,

319
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:41,738
why didn't you show us earlier?

320
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:46,238
He tried to make Akihiko and Kimio look to be murderers

321
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,438
in order to keep them from getting the inheritance.

322
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,538
-What? -That was why Rokurou

323
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,051
hurriedly returned from Tokushima.

324
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,738
Before the body was discovered.

325
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,055
He planned to recover the webcam and plant fake evidence

326
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:02,538
that would make it seem like the crime was committed by his brothers.

327
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:07,065
But before he could, we discovered the body.

328
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,438
You jerk, how could you?

329
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:12,538
At least I proved you two innocent,

330
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,838
-you should thank me! -What?

331
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,638
By the way, what becomes of our share of the inheritance?

332
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,538
That's right! Anyway, just get that safe open!

333
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,738
For the two that act like robbers,

334
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,238
I don't think you have the right to inherit anything!

335
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:27,085
No right to inherit anything, indeed? You "Spy Camera" brat!

336
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,538
You can't just keep everything yourself!

337
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,089
Knock it off already!

338
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,093
Have you still not figured out Hisaemon's feelings?

339
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,095
Dad's feeling?

340
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,097
After Kimio fled,

341
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:45,103
he sat in front of the safe. Hisaemon wept in sorrow!

342
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:48,138
"Wept"? Dad did?

343
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,738
How could you know such a thing?

344
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:54,238
Hisaemon's collar and chest,

345
00:18:54,238 --> 00:18:59,117
traces of a white crystalline substance was slightly found.

346
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:02,038
That is most likely salt.

347
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,238
The tears ended up drying out on his clothes.

348
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:09,127
And left traces of salt.

349
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,738
To have left salt crystals after his tear dried,

350
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:14,438
he must have shed a lot of them, right?

351
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:17,538
Yes. He must have cried in deep sorrow,

352
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,938
and out of great embarrassment.

353
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:22,638
He loved and pampered you all so much.

354
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:26,638
And yet you still cannot take care of yourselves or take responsibility.

355
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:28,438
It was due to the pampering that

356
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:31,938
he felt he had lead you to a life of crime.

357
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,838
And finally he felt hopeless

358
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,638
because he could no longer financially support you.

359
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,738
No longer support, what do you mean?

360
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:44,238
There's nothing left in this house

361
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:46,238
that can be considered valuable.

362
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,038
That can't be!

363
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:49,638
Think about it for a moment.

364
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,438
In a house as large as this one on such a steep hill,

365
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,238
would a senile 70 year-old man

366
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:57,638
live all alone and not hire any servants to help him?

367
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,177
Why do you think that is?

368
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:03,538
No longer... that means he had no money left to hire anyone?

369
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:05,183
He likely sold all his antiques,

370
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:10,138
and had to mortgage his house along with the land.

371
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:13,938
No way! What the heck is the safe for, then?

372
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,638
Tell me what could possibly be in there.

373
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:18,038
Inspector.

374
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:19,638
We have opened the safe.

375
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:21,738
Understand.

376
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,538
Why not go see for yourself?

377
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,638
Oh, no. It can't be.

378
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:33,838
Why... they're all loan contracts.

379
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:37,215
You guys mooched him off, that's why.

380
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,217
Not to mention your movie production costs,

381
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:43,738
surf shop costs, and company operation costs.

382
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,338
Gosh!

383
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:47,538
What do we do now?

384
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,227
It's all over.

385
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:01,938
This... could this be of you three?

386
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:03,241
Yeah.

387
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:07,538
That's from when mom was still alive.

388
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:10,838
That's right. It's so nostalgic.

389
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:33,938
This photo is what Hisaemon left behind,

390
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:37,275
his final inheritance.

391
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:41,279
The happy memories you shared as a family.

392
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,438
They're all presents in that only one photo.

393
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:50,238
However, none of you was able to inherit that present.

394
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:55,038
Guess not.

395
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,838
Sorry, dad.

396
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,238
I'm glad about our family,

397
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:30,638
since we don't have to worry about fighting over inheritance.

398
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:33,738
Oh, yeah, guess you're right.

399
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:35,138
This is it.

400
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,638
Dad?

401
00:23:36,638 --> 00:23:38,538
Miss.

402
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:42,138
Please grab me all these sake bottles.

403
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:45,138
-Yes, sir. -Hold it, dad!

404
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:46,538
What're you doing?

405
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:49,407
What am I doing? I'm buying sake for souvenirs.

406
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,409
If it's just for a souvenir, just buy one bottle!

407
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:54,438
-One bottle! -Don't be so stingy.

408
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:59,038
There won't be any inheritance left at this rate.

409
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,160
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,423
"Flashlight"

411
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,082
Dad's probably going to give up being a detective.

412
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:10,056
What's that you say? Mouri?

413
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,040
Don't yell.
