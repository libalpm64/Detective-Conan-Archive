1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:06,513
"Oh, sushi! Oh, sushi! How happy we are!"

2
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:10,713
"This is the prize for us winning the game we played with Doc"

3
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:14,813
"At the sushi shop"

4
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:19,213
"We'll get to eat sea bream, flatfish, squid and tuna"

5
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:23,213
Well, squid, sea bream, flatfish, whatever!

6
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:26,005
Because the shop we're headed for now has a wide variety of sushi

7
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,513
and is known for being cheap and delicious too!

8
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,313
A wide variety.

9
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,413
Cheap and delicious.

10
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:35,113
It's a sushi shop dream come true!

11
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,017
Doc.

12
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,413
Don't tell me that the sushi at the shop

13
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,513
comes on a rotating conveyer?

14
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,023
Her head sure rotates quite quickly.

15
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,027
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

16
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,313
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

17
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:52,031
The atmosphere changes

18
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,033
in a Rotating sushi shop that everyone likes.

19
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,813
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,813
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,039
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

22
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:47,008
"Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 1)"

23
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,908
"Senpuken"

24
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:53,608
So, it's a shop where the sushi rotates after all.

25
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,608
You promised to take us to a high class sushi shop

26
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,008
because we won the game, right?

27
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,108
That's not nice, Doc!

28
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:03,108
I even only had two servings of rice for breakfast

29
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:06,165
because I wanted to keep myself hungry, you know!

30
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,608
That's more than enough.

31
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,308
Well, maybe you should've thought more of

32
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:14,608
how much everyone was anticipating the sushi.

33
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:17,208
Think of the contents of my wallet too, will you?

34
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,181
Well, it's not something to get so disappointed over

35
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,608
because it's delicious, you see.

36
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:27,108
Have you guys ever eaten sushi that comes rotating, or what?

37
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:29,408
-No. -Me neither.

38
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,908
Dad told me that since I'm an Edoite,

39
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:33,908
I should eat sushi at good shops!

40
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:36,908
Well, I guess that's true.

41
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:39,508
If this is your first time, I'm sure you'd be surprised!

42
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:44,208
Awesome!

43
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,408
-The sushi is rotating! -Really!

44
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:50,608
Is it okay to pick up any plate you want?

45
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,508
Yes, go ahead!

46
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:54,508
But once you pick up a plate,

47
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:56,608
don't ever return it to where it was.

48
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,208
That's bad manners

49
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,219
because they add the total of how much was eaten

50
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:03,408
by counting the different kinds of plates and number of plates there are.

51
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:07,508
But, what if the sushi that you want to eat doesn't come around?

52
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:10,508
Then all you need to do is place an order for it.

53
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:11,608
Just tell Doc what you want

54
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,008
and he'll get it to you using the touch panel.

55
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,508
You can order things like miso soup and steamed eggs, too.

56
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:19,208
What kind of sushi would you like to order?

57
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,208
Okay, I want 10 eels then.

58
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,608
I'd like mackerel or horse mackerel to start with.

59
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,708
I want to eat salmon roe.

60
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,708
Hey, hey. One at a time, okay?

61
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,408
So this is it!

62
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,208
The eels look delicious.

63
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,008
-Dig in. -No, no!

64
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,408
That's some other customer's plate!

65
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:42,908
In this shop, it seems that when the plate that you ordered

66
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,008
passes in front of you, it beeps.

67
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:52,271
Here it comes! My eels.

68
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,273
Dig in!

69
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,508
It's delicious!

70
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,908
Here it comes!

71
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,281
Salmon roe.

72
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,285
Delicious!

73
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,308
It sure is good!

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,208
What fun! It's good!

75
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,808
There couldn't have been a better place than this.

76
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:14,808
Right.

77
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:17,908
It doesn't meet up to the standard of a first class sushi shop,

78
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:21,808
but for them, it's better for them to have fun while eating.

79
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:24,108
My eels are coming one after the other.

80
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,608
I already took your plate for you, Conan.

81
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,008
See.

82
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,008
All salmon roe.

83
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,708
I love salmon roe.

84
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,608
Eat to your heart's content too, Conan.

85
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,808
But I can't that many rows of it.

86
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,008
-Yummy! -What a dull play on words.

87
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:44,908
Boy, did I eat.

88
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,708
-It was pretty good, wasn't it? -Yep.

89
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,808
Look, there's pudding too!

90
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,008
No joke?

91
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,408
Oh, no!

92
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:56,335
-God, watch out, will you? -Sorry.

93
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:58,108
Huh?

94
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,341
There's a strange pattern on the back of the plate.

95
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,008
That's the mark used to automatically get rid of the plates!

96
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,008
The pattern is read by the sensor

97
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:10,708
and gets rid of all the sushi that's been going around for some time!

98
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,708
It's difficult to tell when the sushi was made just by looking at it,

99
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,508
and of course it's difficult to remember when it was made either!

100
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,708
Hey, brats.

101
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,308
I hope you didn't drop the plates on purpose

102
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:24,908
to confuse how much you're supposed to really pay.

103
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:27,308
Of course I wouldn't do something like that.

104
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:30,108
I'm sorry. Since this is the first time

105
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:32,708
that these children have ever come to a sushi shop...

106
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,373
Their first time?

107
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,708
Which means that they're usually eating delicious sushi all the time?

108
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,381
They belong to class way above you, they say.

109
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,408
Right, flatfish boy?

110
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,385
What?

111
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:49,808
It's the fish that your wife used to like, boy.

112
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,208
Flatfish.

113
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,393
Aren't you going to pick it up? Flatfish.

114
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,708
I see, I see. This is sea bass.

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,808
Please stop it, sir!

116
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:04,108
You're going to be bothering the other customers,

117
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,405
so please refrain from making a racket.

118
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,408
Shut up! I don't want a man like you

119
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:11,608
who can't do any better than to cling onto sushi

120
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,008
and be a manager of this shop telling me anything.

121
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,508
That has nothing to do with what I'm saying.

122
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:18,108
I'll see to it that I run you out of business.

123
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:21,008
I may not look it, but I'm a pretty well-known food writer, you know.

124
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,308
It would only take a week

125
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:26,208
to drive your shop to close down, you know?

126
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,608
For example, like the shop of that woman

127
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:32,431
who's eating sneakily at the edge over there.

128
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,408
What's up, you guys?

129
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:38,008
Stop looking, hey!

130
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:41,808
Okay, I won't charge you for today,

131
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,508
so will you please leave?

132
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,108
Free?

133
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:48,447
Okay, I guess I'll eat to my heart's content and leave then.

134
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,008
Sir...

135
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,108
What a nasty man.

136
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,708
I don't feel happy anymore.

137
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,008
-Let's go home! -I guess so.

138
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,463
It'll be 8,700 yen.

139
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:07,308
They sure ate a lot.

140
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,508
Boy, give me a break.

141
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,008
Thank you so very much.

142
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:15,108
Please bring us here again, Doc.

143
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,508
When there aren't any nasty customers, though.

144
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:19,208
Yeah.

145
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,108
Sir?

146
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,489
Are you all right, sir?

147
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,491
-What the... -Oh no! Food poisoning?

148
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,908
-Hey, don't eat it! Put it back. -Okay.

149
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,108
-Let's change shops. -Yeah.

150
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,508
Don't move!

151
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:42,808
If you even move a bit from where you are now,

152
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,008
I'm going to tell the police officers who come here about it.

153
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,908
Police... sonny?

154
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:51,108
His mouth smells like almond.

155
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:55,708
This man was poisoned by cyanide.

156
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,108
What? Poison...

157
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:02,521
Moreover, since there are 2 or 3 rice grains on his finger...

158
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,525
It's highly likely that poison was mixed into the sushi!

159
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
Under this special circumstance,

160
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,208
there would have been many chances to do it!

161
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,531
At any rate, Doc!

162
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,408
-Hurry and call the police and ambulance! -Okay!

163
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,908
Will you please stop the conveyer belt right away, manager?

164
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:19,908
Okay!

165
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,541
Stand back!

166
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,543
You again?

167
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,208
Conan.

168
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,547
Yep, sort of.

169
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,549
I thought that the one who the bad luck holder

170
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,551
that calls incidents was Mr. Mouri,

171
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,553
but it could be you.

172
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:35,808
No, that's...

173
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,908
He's not a bad luck holder!

174
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:40,208
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad!

175
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,561
We can't help it if cases just happen to happen!

176
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,808
Cases just happen to need us!

177
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:48,008
What's with your haughty attitude?

178
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:51,408
And? Was the poison inside the sushi after all?

179
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:55,408
No. We can't say for sure yet

180
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:59,008
unless we examine the inside of the stomach of the victim.

181
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:01,308
According to the report of the forensic officer,

182
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,708
the poison seems to have been on the last plate

183
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,585
that the victim took on this part of the plate.

184
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,808
So, it's very likely...

185
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:11,108
I see. The culprit pretended to take the plate

186
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,008
and touched it with his/her hand that had poison on it.

187
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:15,608
Then, if the culprit without taking the plate and pass it to him,

188
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:18,108
he or she could've given the poisoned plate to the victim.

189
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:21,008
Yes, so it seems that when the victim took that plate,

190
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,108
his finger was poisoned,

191
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:27,008
and picked up the sushi and ate it.

192
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:31,008
So, are you sure that nobody moved since this happened?

193
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:34,008
Yes! No one in the kitchen moved either, right?

194
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,008
Yeah. Because I made sure no one did after you told me to do so.

195
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,908
Okay, let's do a body check then!

196
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,108
If you're sure of what you just said,

197
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,308
I'm sure the culprit still has the container with the poison inside,

198
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,108
or the poison soaked handkerchief on him or her.

199
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,408
Take the customers who were sitting in the lane

200
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,108
where the victim was sitting

201
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,108
as well as the employees in charge of the lane

202
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,208
-to another room and inspect them! -Yes, sir!

203
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,108
Yes. Especially the three

204
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,308
who seem to have been on bad terms with the victim.

205
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:02,641
They should be checked as thoroughly as possible.

206
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,408
Nothing?

207
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,008
Are you saying you couldn't find a container with poison in it

208
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:12,651
or a poison soaked handkerchief either?

209
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,408
No. No one nor anywhere.

210
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,655
No way.

211
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,808
There was no chance for anyone to have disposed the poison.

212
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,308
Then, why doesn't anyone have the poison?

213
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:24,663
Besides, is there a way

214
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:28,208
in which the poisoned plate can be given only to the victim?

215
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,408
How could the culprit make sure that no one would take the plate part way,

216
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:33,808
and set it up so that only the victim would pick it up?

217
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,184
Food writer?

218
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:50,689
Was Mr. Agatsuma, the victim a food writer?

219
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:55,584
Yes, he was a writer notorious for his harsh comments.

220
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,284
The shops that he says are delicious,

221
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,484
are really reputed as being delicious.

222
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,084
And he seems to have been taken very well by the readers.

223
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,703
On the other hand, the customers of the stores that he criticizes

224
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,184
decrease drastically,

225
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,984
and some cases the stores actually seem to have gone bankrupt.

226
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:13,484
That could be the motive for the murder.

227
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,484
But the point is

228
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,284
how did the killer make him take the plate smeared with poison?

229
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,884
Right.

230
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:22,484
By using this rotating sushi system,

231
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,484
it's possible to automatically bring the poisoned plate

232
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,984
in front of Mr. Agatsuma.

233
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,729
But that doesn't mean he would pick it up 100%.

234
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,384
Well, there seems to have been many customers

235
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,684
seated in the lane where the victim was eating.

236
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:37,684
So, including the people who were in the kitchen,

237
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:40,384
we've got to check everyone thoroughly.

238
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,484
Well, I think there were only three people

239
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:44,284
who could've smeared poison on the plate.

240
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:46,284
-Three people? -Yes.

241
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,747
It seems that a little before, Mr. Agatsuma took the poisoned plate

242
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,384
and ate the sushi with his fingers,

243
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:53,684
he had an argument with the shop manager.

244
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:56,755
That man shouted in a really loud voice and was making a racket!

245
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,084
It was really scary!

246
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,184
He was also taking his anger out on the other customers.

247
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:06,765
It seems that the customers sitting opposite him

248
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,084
were all getting ready to leave because of what happened,

249
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:12,771
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

250
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,384
The people sitting opposite him said

251
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,584
they didn't pick up any plates

252
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:18,384
from about 5 minutes before Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

253
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:19,984
I see.

254
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:23,184
Several plates would go around in 5 minutes.

255
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:25,984
Which means that poison couldn't have been smeared on to a plate

256
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:29,284
that Mr. Agatsuma wouldn't pick up on the first round.

257
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,789
In other words, the suspicious people

258
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:34,284
would be those who are in the kitchen and cannot be seen from here.

259
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:36,795
Rather, there were practically no plates left to pick up

260
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,797
because Mr. Agatsuma made a racket.

261
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,184
However, the employees are saying that

262
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:44,084
they didn't place any newly made sushi on the lane in question.

263
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,784
In other words, the ones who could've

264
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,584
smeared poison on the plate after the racket are

265
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:53,484
the man who sat to the left of the man who was killed

266
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,584
and the woman who was seated at the edge

267
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,984
on the right hand side of the man

268
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:02,821
with 6 people between them and the store manager

269
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:05,584
who was the first to run up to the man who collapsed.

270
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,827
That's right, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

271
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,284
Yeah.

272
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,831
But, why would the store manager who ran over be included too?

273
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,484
Well...

274
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:16,835
I did mention that the store manager had an argument with Mr. Agatsuma

275
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,984
before he collapsed, that's why.

276
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,841
They were arguing near Mr. Agatsuma's seat,

277
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,284
and it seems that they confronted each other at quite a close range,

278
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:27,584
-so I included him just in case. -Besides, the three...

279
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:31,384
seem to somehow have some connection with the man who was killed!

280
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:44,484
You got into a fight with Mr. Agatsuma before at this shop?

281
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:48,867
Yes. I was boasting to my wife

282
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,484
that the flatfish here is cheap but delicious.

283
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:56,484
Then, he suddenly butt in from the side.

284
00:14:56,484 --> 00:15:00,284
"That's not flatfish, it's sea bass, stupid."

285
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,184
Was it sea bass?

286
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,284
After taking a good taste at it again, yes, it was.

287
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:08,887
I see.

288
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,584
He embarrassed you in front of your wife.

289
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:13,184
That's not all!

290
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:15,684
I don't know how he found it,

291
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:17,384
but he wrote his comment

292
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,884
in my gourmet walk around blog bulletin board.

293
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,584
He wrote, "This guy's got the tongue of a poor boy!

294
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,903
This blog is a bunch of baloney!"

295
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:29,484
But it's not that I held a grudge against him because of it.

296
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:33,284
But your seat was right next to Mr. Agatusma's.

297
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:36,084
You would've had many chances to poison his dish.

298
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:39,184
Next to him yes, but I was to his left.

299
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:42,184
The sushi was going round from the right to the left.

300
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,923
So, I couldn't have smeared poison on the plate that he picked up!

301
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,927
Does it go from right to left?

302
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,884
Yes, it spins clockwise.

303
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,384
Although it stopped now after this boy told me to do so.

304
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:56,935
So, it means that

305
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,937
even if poison were to be smeared onto Mr. Agatsuma's plate,

306
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:00,939
the plate would have had to spin once around

307
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,984
before passing in front of him.

308
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:06,684
Yes. And besides, that plate would be one

309
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,947
that Mr. Agatsuma let spin once around

310
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,284
so it is highly likely that he wouldn't pick it up

311
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,951
even if it came around again.

312
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,955
But it would be a different story for the woman sitting to his right.

313
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,184
Hey, hold it.

314
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,384
Even if I were to smear poison on the plate,

315
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:23,484
there's no guarantee that the good-for-nothing would pick the plate up!

316
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:24,984
Good-for-nothing?

317
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,284
You seem to be involved with Mr. Agatsuma in some way, too.

318
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:30,684
Yes! I sure do!

319
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:33,784
The Japanese cuisine shop that I ran went bankrupt

320
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,975
thanks to the article he wrote!

321
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,384
Went bankrupt?

322
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:40,684
Because of Mr. Agatsuma's article?

323
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:41,784
Yes.

324
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:46,184
That man used to frequent my shop in the past,

325
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:48,984
but he wrote, "The taste of the shop suddenly went down,

326
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:51,284
and take-out sushi that comes in plastic containers taste better."

327
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:53,584
Is... Is that so?

328
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,184
I couldn't help it!

329
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:58,984
Our sushi cook quit because of old age

330
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,684
and the sushi cook said to be good, who supposed to take his place

331
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,984
suddenly refused to take the position!

332
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:10,284
Don't tell me that the sushi cook is you, manager?

333
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:13,011
Yes. My boss of the shop that I worked for previously

334
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,013
was acquainted with her

335
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,584
and he'd asked me to work for her, too.

336
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:21,019
But just when I was about to go, I hurt my arm

337
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:26,284
and I refused because I wasn't able to make sushi like I used to.

338
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,584
How did you hurt your arm?

339
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:31,484
I tried to stop some customers from fighting

340
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,684
and hurt my arm muscle.

341
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,584
And one of the customers was

342
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:41,039
that Mr. Agatsuma, you see.

343
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:48,184
Well, that's why I gave up being a cook

344
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:50,584
but I couldn't forget the aroma of vinegar rice,

345
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,684
so I decided to work as manager here.

346
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:55,584
But I wouldn't do such a thing as smear poison on the plate.

347
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,884
But you were right near him

348
00:17:57,884 --> 00:18:01,059
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed too, weren't you?

349
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,784
That's true,

350
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,063
but I didn't touch the plates that were rotating

351
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,384
and as the woman was saying

352
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:11,884
even if I were to be able to somehow smear poison on the plate,

353
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:15,073
how would I make him pick it up?

354
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,684
Well...

355
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:19,784
Maybe it was his favorite dish?

356
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:23,081
He picked it up because it was a dish that he liked very much!

357
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,784
-If it were Genta, it would be eels! -Yeah!

358
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:28,284
If it comes around, I wouldn't let it go pass me.

359
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:30,684
What kind of dish did Mr. Agatsuma like?

360
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:33,484
He didn't have anything he like in particular.

361
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:37,384
Well, I guess even if he did have a favorite, it would be irrelevant.

362
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:41,084
That is, even if it were to be the victim's favorite,

363
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,584
whether he would pick up his favourite or not

364
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:44,784
would depend on how he feels at that time.

365
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:49,107
There's no way of knowing 100% what sushi he would pick up.

366
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:52,584
Of course anyone could've picked up the poisoned plate.

367
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,784
It would be a different story, though,

368
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:57,684
if this were indiscriminate murder.

369
00:18:57,684 --> 00:18:59,117
True.

370
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,784
But I wonder? Is there a way

371
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:05,684
to make only Mr. Agatsuma pick up the poisoned plate?

372
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,384
That's right, he could order it!

373
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:10,884
If he placed the order for the sushi,

374
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,131
he would pick it up for sure!

375
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,133
-Place an order? -Yes.

376
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:17,484
If you place an order using this touch panel,

377
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:20,784
the sushi comes in a bowl with the sign "ordered" on it,

378
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,384
and when it comes in front of you, there is beeping sound.

379
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,584
I see!

380
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,284
So, Ms. Takemura who was seated to the right of the victim

381
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,284
could've done it!

382
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:32,184
No way.

383
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:35,153
Even if an ordered plate were to come around,

384
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,155
I couldn't have smeared poison on it!

385
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,684
Because beyond him, there was a man who was wearing a cap,

386
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,161
I had no way of knowing which one of them had placed the order!

387
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,684
Besides, I can't even see the touch panel from my seat,

388
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:51,184
so I wasn't able to tell what he ordered.

389
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:54,084
The only one who could see it

390
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:57,175
was Mr. Aizono who was sitting next to him.

391
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,177
Hey, hold it, will you?

392
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,179
I mentioned it a while ago too,

393
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,484
but I was sitting to the left of Mr. Agatsuma,

394
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:06,984
and the sushi was rotating from right to left!

395
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:08,384
Even if I were to be able to see

396
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:11,584
what Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel,

397
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:15,784
the plate would be picked up by him before it reaches me!

398
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,184
True.

399
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:21,684
Besides, I'm not the only one who can see the touch panel.

400
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:24,084
The manager can too!

401
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,684
Because after arguing with Mr. Agatsuma

402
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,684
and up to the time Mr. Agatsuma collapsed,

403
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,784
he was standing behind him!

404
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:33,211
-Is that true? -Yes.

405
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:36,284
Since Mr. Agatsuma was making such a racket,

406
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:39,484
I told him, "You don't have to pay, so please leave."

407
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,284
Then he said, "If it's free, I'll eat and leave."

408
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,284
So, I stood behind him

409
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,684
to watch that he wouldn't make further trouble.

410
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:50,284
Well, but as far as I saw,

411
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,231
he didn't seem to have been ordering anything.

412
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:57,235
We can tell for sure if I check the computer though.

413
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,684
-Check it. -Yes, sir.

414
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:04,584
Officer.

415
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,784
Haven't you forgotten?

416
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:09,247
You did a body check on us a while ago,

417
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,884
but no container with poison inside,

418
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:14,384
nor any handkerchief soaked with poison was found!

419
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:18,284
Despite of this, I question why you keep on suspecting us.

420
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:19,584
I'm sure that the killer

421
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:22,584
was among the customers that already left the shop.

422
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:25,784
Maybe that's why the container with poison inside wasn't found.

423
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,284
Which means unless we capture that killer,

424
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:34,584
we'll never find out how just Mr. Agatsuma was targeted.

425
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,984
No. I'm pretty sure that the killer is among the three here.

426
00:21:38,984 --> 00:21:43,984
First, Mr. Osamu Aizono who was seated left of Mr. Agatsuma.

427
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:45,284
Mr. Aizono would be able to tell

428
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:49,784
what kind of sushi Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel

429
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:53,884
but since the sushi goes round from right to left,

430
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:55,293
Mr. Agatsuma would pick up the plate

431
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:58,384
before the poison is smeared onto the plate.

432
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,084
If it were Ms. Sakiko Takemura

433
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,584
who was seated to the right of Mr. Agatsuma, with us in between...

434
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,384
She would've been able to smear poison on the plate

435
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,884
before he picked it up,

436
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:10,084
but she couldn't see the touch panel from where she was seated.

437
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,313
Mr. Danji Namiki who was standing behind Mr. Agatsuma

438
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,584
could also have watched the touch panel.

439
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:22,284
But Mr. Namiki didn't move from behind Mr. Agatsuma,

440
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,884
so he couldn't touch the sushi plates.

441
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:28,384
Who on earth is the killer?

442
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:31,684
And how did the killer

443
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:36,084
target only Mr. Agatsuma with the poisoned plate?

444
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,423
"The method of eating sushi"

446
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,425
First, order eels.

447
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,520
Next, order a bowl of eels over rice.
