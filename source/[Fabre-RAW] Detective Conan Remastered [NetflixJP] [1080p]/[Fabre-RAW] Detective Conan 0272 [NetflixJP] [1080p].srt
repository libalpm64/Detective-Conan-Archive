1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,670
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,470
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,070
What is the dying message?

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,170
There's something we're missing.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,870
While we were at the cafe with teacher, Ms. Jodie,

9
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,270
all the lights in the building went out.

10
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,370
And after the blackout,

11
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,570
the dead body holding an envelope was

12
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,070
found by an escalator near the cafe!

13
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,170
The victim was Mr. Katsunori Nakajo,

14
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,470
the manager of a detective agency.

15
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,570
His dying message as written with his own blood

16
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,470
on the envelope.

17
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,070
But, the murderer pulled the document out of it.

18
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,170
And...

19
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,070
Inspector, we've found another character written with blood!

20
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,270
What?

21
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,570
A square?

22
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,870
It also looks like a Kanji character, mouth

23
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,570
or "ro" in the Katakana alphabet.

24
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,270
But judging from the previous circle, cross and triangle,

25
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,770
is most likely to be a square.

26
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,770
Well... I'm more confused than ever now.

27
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,870
Isn't that square...

28
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,770
a little bigger than the other circle, cross and triangle?

29
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,770
"Hide, Hurry up and Abbreviate it (Part 2)"

30
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,570
Hey! Ran!

31
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,670
What?

32
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,570
We can make a character by combining two

33
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,070
of the marks-the circle, cross and triangle, can't we?

34
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,270
For a example,

35
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,070
combining the cross and the square would create

36
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,270
the word for rice field.

37
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,170
Yeah.

38
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,570
If so, this Mr. Hari is very suspicious.

39
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,470
And this last name is very unique.

40
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,870
But how about this Mr. Nawata?

41
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,870
His last name has three parts containing the same word!

42
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,070
Mr. Asai also has a unique shape of two overlapping crosses!

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,970
Shape?

44
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,770
Yeah, that's it! It's a shape!

45
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,770
For example,

46
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,570
think about the word "Suzu" in Mr. Suzuki's.

47
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,070
It has a round shape. So, could indicate Mr. Suzuki.

48
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,370
How rude!

49
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,970
I'm a Suzuki too!

50
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,870
There are no bad people by the name of Suzuki!

51
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,270
Oh, but...

52
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,470
Anyway, leave it to us, the police.

53
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,770
And stay away from the crime scene, okay?

54
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,270
Come on.

55
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,970
Takagi! You go ahead

56
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,670
and help Chiba search and help Chiba the upper floors.

57
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,070
Yes, sir!

58
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,970
I have to tell dad

59
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,270
that I'm going to be late!

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,970
Hello.. Chiba?

61
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,670
Where are you now?

62
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,470
The eighth floor?

63
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,170
Yeah, Inspector told me to go help you.

64
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,370
Yeah.

65
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,870
All right! Just hold on.

66
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,570
I'll be right up there!

67
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,670
All right.

68
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,470
Wait...

69
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,470
Ran, what's wrong?

70
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,070
What is it?

71
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,570
What is that "X"?

72
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,170
What?

73
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,770
You know. You said a little while ago...

74
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,170
You said it's a tease.

75
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,170
Oh, well. Yumi often puts "XXX" at the end of the mail

76
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,170
to tease me.

77
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,870
Well, Ran, just you wait.

78
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,370
Someday, sooner or later you'll see what "X" means.

79
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,470
Right now! Tell me right now!

80
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,370
Please. Detective Takagi!

81
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,070
Ran.

82
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,970
That's...

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,070
Fine.

84
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,370
Ms. Mouri, is sure taking a long time to come back.

85
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,070
That brat has gone somewhere, too.

86
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,070
Oh! You mean that cool kid.

87
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,070
-He's over there! -I'm sorry.

88
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,570
Gosh.

89
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,670
Hey! Cool kid!

90
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,170
You look like an Ostrich.

91
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,070
What? An Ostrich?

92
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,170
The meaning of the circle, cross and triangle...

93
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,070
Have you figured it out yet?

94
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,470
Not, yet.

95
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,870
Not at all.

96
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,770
Well, as Ran said,

97
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,970
don't you think that those shapes

98
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,570
may be representing something else?

99
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,270
Let me see. For example,

100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,070
the department of defense in America

101
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,370
is called the Pentagon.

102
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,570
That is because the actually building itself

103
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,470
is a pentagon.

104
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,970
In the U.S., there are many words that represent something

105
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,370
other than it's original meaning!

106
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,670
The White House means the Presidential residence,

107
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,870
while the word the Oval Office refers to

108
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,870
the official office of the President of the United States.

109
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,870
And there is another word,

110
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,070
Bureau, that originally means an office.

111
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,770
But the word as it stands alone,

112
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,270
it often means F. B. I.

113
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,770
Which is an abbreviation for the Federal Bureau of Investigation!

114
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,370
Was my advice any good to you, cool kid?

115
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,270
Yeah.

116
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,970
By the way, what did you mean

117
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,170
when you said the word, Ostrich?

118
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,370
Oh! I was talking about you, cool kid!

119
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,270
The officer caught you even though you were hiding yourself

120
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,470
behind the suitcase.

121
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,970
We, Americans, call such dorks Ostrich.

122
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,170
Once he sticks his small head into the sand,

123
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,270
the ostrich usually fails to realize what remains exposed

124
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,670
and thinks he can't be seen because he can't see!

125
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,070
There is a similar expression in Japan here!

126
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,670
That is, Hiding your head but leaving your rear end exposed!

127
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,870
Hiding the head but leaving the rear end exposed?

128
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,370
Let me see the envelope for a second!

129
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,570
Hey, you!

130
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,270
Now I see.

131
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,070
So that explains it.

132
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,770
There's no doubt!

133
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,570
Among those 31 suspects, that person...

134
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,070
is the culprit!

135
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,470
I understand.

136
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,570
We will send investigators there right away.

137
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,170
Yes.

138
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,970
Now, please don't touch the manager's computer anymore.

139
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,070
Well then...

140
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,470
What's going on?

141
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,170
Nothing.

142
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,570
The victim killed was the director of a detective agency

143
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,170
and the culprit is most likely to be

144
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,970
the embezzler of the company he was investigating.

145
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,770
So that's why I inquired at the agency,

146
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,770
just hoping to find someone who worked with him

147
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,770
and can tell us the name of the embezzler.

148
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,470
And then?

149
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,470
Unfortunately, Mr. Nakajo was working on this case alone

150
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,570
and kept it in strict confidence.

151
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,770
So none of his employees know anything about the case.

152
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,770
And our last hope is the data stored on his computer.

153
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,270
But no one can access it without the password.

154
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,970
Password.

155
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,270
That's it. That's the password!

156
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,970
The circle, cross, triangle and square.

157
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,670
Isn't that his password?

158
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,270
Yeah, I thought so too

159
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,570
and asked the agency staff to enter the password box,

160
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,270
but it failed.

161
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,870
But...

162
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,270
Of course, they tried all 24 possible combinations.

163
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,370
They couldn't make it.

164
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,370
Then, could the circle, cross, triangle, square

165
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,570
be the name of the culprit?

166
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,870
Isn't that about Quiz?

167
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,370
-What? -Japanese Quiz Show

168
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,970
often uses those marks

169
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,370
instead of answering Yes or No.

170
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,270
Oh... I see. It's like that!

171
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,970
So... Is the culprit the King of Quiz?

172
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,670
Yeah. Could be.

173
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,870
Anyway, you just stay still here and keep quiet!

174
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,670
Don't interfere in this case anymore.

175
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,070
But, if the the circle, cross, triangle and square

176
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,670
is the name of the culprit

177
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,670
then Officer Chiba could also be a suspect?

178
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,770
What?

179
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,070
Because just look at the character of Officer Chiba.

180
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,270
It looks like a cross if I hide it like this.

181
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,270
And it looks like a triangle if I hide it like this!

182
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,770
Don't you think he is also very suspicious!

183
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,270
Hide?

184
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,570
Look at that! If you look at it that way,

185
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,970
Officer Takagi could be a suspect too.

186
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,370
What?

187
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,570
Look! The word "Taka" of Officer Takagi's name!

188
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,370
It looks like both a square or a circle if I hide it like this!

189
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,070
I understand it looks like square

190
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,270
but why does it look like a circle?

191
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,470
Because there are some people who write "mouth" as a circle.

192
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,670
Dr. Agasa also often writes in that way

193
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,370
when he writes his name.

194
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,570
Dr. Agasa said it's okay to abbreviate something sometimes,

195
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,670
particularly when you're in a hurry.

196
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,970
Hide it.

197
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,270
Hurry it up and abbreviate it

198
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,370
Hey, come on! Officer Chiba and Officer Takagi,

199
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,970
both came here because I called them!

200
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,370
Both of them can't be the culprit.

201
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,070
Hey! Are you listening to me?

202
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,570
Oh, wait a minute.

203
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,470
There is someone

204
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,170
on the suspect list.

205
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,770
I think...

206
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,170
This is it!

207
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,420
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,820
There is someone

209
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,520
on the suspect list.

210
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,820
I think...

211
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,220
This is it!

212
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,520
It's Bunta Kuniyoshi!

213
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Bunta Kuniyoshi?

214
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Ah, that's right.

215
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Well, then how does he become

216
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,220
the circle, cross, triangle and square?

217
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,620
There appears to be no connection between those two.

218
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,720
But, if you hide the top halves of the three characters...

219
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,920
See? These characters become the symbols.

220
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,620
Oh, yes!

221
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,320
They sure are the circle, cross, triangle and square!

222
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,620
But don't you think that

223
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,120
it is difficult to look upon the character

224
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,320
Sonoko! You're...

225
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,120
The character doesn't look like a triangle when it is printed,

226
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,620
but if it were hand-written

227
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,220
and the dot are elongated,

228
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,020
then wouldn't it look like a triangle?

229
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,620
But why were the top halves hidden?

230
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
They weren't hidden

231
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,220
but they were removed.

232
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,720
Don't you remember that

233
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,420
the characters were written down at the edge of the envelope?

234
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,020
And that the square, which was discovered later,

235
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,120
was one size larger than any other marks.

236
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,320
This means that the three characters other than the square

237
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,220
were written across both the envelope

238
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,620
and a sheet of paper sticking out of the envelope.

239
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,920
And the murderer took the documents

240
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,320
including the sheet of paper

241
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,120
with the top halves of the three characters written on it.

242
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,920
And how about the square?

243
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,820
Well, of course, it's the "kuni" of his name.

244
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
If the victim had written it in a hurry

245
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,220
before the culprit noticed him doing so,

246
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,520
it is quite reasonable to think that he abbreviated it.

247
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,820
Now I've got it!

248
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,520
It's true!

249
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,120
Yeah, I've seen people

250
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,020
who abbreviate to shorthand dictation!

251
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,220
Great!

252
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,420
You're just like Jules Maigret

253
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,120
straight coming out of the novel.

254
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
Oh, Come on!

255
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,720
Now we know who the culprit is.

256
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,220
Let's go get him on the upper floor.

257
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,120
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

258
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,920
Oh, it's this late already.

259
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,120
I wonder where Ms. Mouri is.

260
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,720
Maybe she's asking Shinichi

261
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
about the meaning of the "X" on the phone.

262
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,920
Yeah! As I suggested,

263
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,620
if he gets the answer right, she may give him her special "X".

264
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Well, well, I will give my cherished "X" to him.

265
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,320
Sonoko!

266
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,120
I have asked Detective Takagi

267
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,020
about the meaning of "X"!

268
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,620
I see.

269
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,920
How could you?

270
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,320
If I say that I'd give him my "X",

271
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,120
Shinichi wouldn't answer even if he knew the answer.

272
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,020
Well, I bet he doesn't know the answer

273
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
because he knows very little

274
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,520
about this sort of thing.

275
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,320
By the way, I wonder where is Conan?

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,120
What? Oh, don't tell me he is missing again!

277
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,120
That little brat is always going straying off somewhere!

278
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,720
Kuniyoshi?

279
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,520
Oh, yes. He's here!

280
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,820
Hey, Kuniyoshi!

281
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,620
What is it?

282
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,720
Sorry to bother you

283
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,520
but we have questions to ask you.

284
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,720
Could you come with us to another room, please?

285
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,920
That's...

286
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,320
No problem.

287
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,620
A shredder!

288
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,120
Okay.

289
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,320
And you're saying that...

290
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,220
"Square, circle, cross, triangle".

291
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,120
Those marks signifies my name

292
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,620
"Bunta Kuniyoshi" -if you add those missing parts to them?

293
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,820
Yes, exactly.

294
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,920
But, Inspector?

295
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,720
It seems too hasty to conclude based only on the deduction,

296
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
that I am the culprit. Don't you think so?

297
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,020
Yet, that is his dying message!

298
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,120
Well, look at it this way.

299
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,820
The murderer might have written those bloody marks

300
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,720
with that old man's finger,

301
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,320
trying to put the guilt on me!

302
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,120
So, if you want to grill me,

303
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,820
you go find the missing document

304
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,220
and show it to me first!

305
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,520
Let's say, if I were the culprit,

306
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,320
I wouldn't stay in this building

307
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,720
where the murder was committed,

308
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,420
but run away outside and try to burn the papers.

309
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,520
That's why you destroyed them with the shredder, right?

310
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,120
But it was much easier than a jigsaw puzzle to put together

311
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,520
because of the red marks.

312
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,220
Right, Officer Takagi?

313
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,120
Yeah.

314
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,420
Here it is.

315
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,520
Oh, you've found it!

316
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Yes!

317
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
It wasn't too difficult to find shreds of paper with blood on it

318
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,720
and then piece them together.

319
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,420
They correctly matched the characters on the envelope!

320
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,820
So, there is no doubt that these bloody characters

321
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,120
signify Bunta Kuniyoshi.

322
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,720
"Bunta"

323
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,820
As you've already identified the shredder,

324
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,120
if you spend a little extra time,

325
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,420
you can put the remaining pieces together, right?

326
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Yes! And since we've also found the murderers cast-off gloves

327
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,120
at a rest room on the way to this office,

328
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,120
if Mr. Kuniyoshi put the papers into the shredder himself,

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,420
we can detect his fingerprints attached to them.

330
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,620
Circle, cross and triangle.

331
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,020
Now I see.

332
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,620
I had the nicknames of Big Mouth

333
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,020
and Circle, Cross and Triangle when I was in college.

334
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,220
But back then I didn't know why they called me by these names.

335
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,920
So that explains it.

336
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,320
I started embezzling from the company

337
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,920
because I really wanted to give my family a better life,

338
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,320
not one that was all mouth.

339
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,720
But once I made it, I just couldn't stop myself.

340
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,220
After all, I have a big mouth, I know it.

341
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,420
All evil comes from the mouth.

342
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,920
Oh, the police arrested the guy already?

343
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,720
Yeah, he was taken to the police just now through the back door.

344
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,820
Hey...

345
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,320
Now, you gotta tell me!

346
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
What's the "X" anyway?

347
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,520
Oh, do you still wanna know?

348
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Yeah.

349
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,220
If you really want to know about it,

350
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,920
ask Ran!

351
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,320
Look! She's tapping out an e-mail over there.

352
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,620
So hurry

353
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:46,620
and come back!

354
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,120
Hey! What does the "X" mean?

355
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,620
Sonoko told me to ask you!

356
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,920
It's not good for you.

357
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,820
No...

358
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,120
Not good?

359
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh, yeah! The "X" means "no good"!

360
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,720
See you then, Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki!

361
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,920
Watch out for the stalker!

362
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,120
-We will, Ms. Jodie! -We will, Ms. Jodie!

363
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,520
Is it almost time to pick the apple?

364
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,120
Hey, Sato, Yamamoto and Kobayashi!

365
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Are you all right, Mr. Tozawa?

366
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,320
Shut up!

367
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,620
I got a mail.

368
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,920
It's from Ran.

369
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,520
Today, I got involved in an incident again!

370
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,020
Maybe, I must be...

371
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,120
I must be cursed!

372
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,720
I know you want to hear more about the case.

373
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,820
I'll let you know the details later.

374
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,920
So hurry and come back!

375
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,420
XXX.

376
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,320
What's this?

377
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,920
Does this mean I am three times "no good"?

378
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,620
Can you tell me, please, Gin?

379
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,920
Do you believe in heaven?

380
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,020
You may say coldly...

381
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,220
"It's not like you to be so silly".

382
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,820
Please find the answer.

383
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,120
Until we exchange our glasses filled with rotten sherry.

384
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,820
I can't wait.

385
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,720
XXX.

386
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,720
Well, "X" means a kiss.

387
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,320
It's a feminine expression of affection.

388
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,020
But it could be also...

389
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,920
a sign of hatred.

390
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,820
Sure.

391
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,520
X also means the target.

392
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,020
With the silver arrow is shot.

393
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,220
Next Conan Hint:

394
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,680
"Cat"
