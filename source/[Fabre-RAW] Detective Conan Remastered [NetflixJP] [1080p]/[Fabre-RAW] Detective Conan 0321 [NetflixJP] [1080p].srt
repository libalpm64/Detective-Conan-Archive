1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,340
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,340
It's a kidnap case demanding ransom.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,140
What happened in the tunnel?

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,160
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,060
"Beika General Hospital"

10
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,960
Yeah, I thought that Masked Yaiba was going to lose yesterday.

11
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,760
What a thing to say!

12
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,260
Yes, he missed his Yaiba kick.

13
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,360
Jun!

14
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
Hello!

15
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son"

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
How's it, Jun?

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,960
How's your broken bone? Is it better now?

18
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,960
You don't look too happy.

19
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,660
They're Jun's classmates. They always come to visit him.

20
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,460
Oh.

21
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,460
Thank you so much!

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,060
Oh, no, it's nothing, really...

23
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,660
We're friends so...

24
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,660
You two are always like that when you see pretty women.

25
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,260
How disgusting! Don't you think so?

26
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,960
Hey! Jun.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,660
I didn't know you had an older sister.

28
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,060
Did you call me his older sister?

29
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,960
Oh! Yes!

30
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
My, how flattering.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,860
She's Ms. Sachiko Ezaki, a fashion designer.

32
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,760
A fashion designer?

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Wow!

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Did you come to visit Jun?

35
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
Yes!

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,160
Nice meeting you all!

37
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,260
Come over to my place someday!

38
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,260
You're all very welcomed to come!

39
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,860
Place?

40
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,060
Jun's house.

41
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,160
Jun's house?

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
What do you mean?

43
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,060
She means...

44
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,760
I think you'd better go already!

45
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,060
Isn't it time for your fashion show recital to start?

46
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,960
Oh, right.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,860
We'd better get going then.

48
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,160
Okay.

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,860
See you, Jun.

50
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,360
Since Jun looks bored,

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
please spend as much time as you can with him.

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,460
Goodbye.

53
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,360
Jun, you'll be discharged tomorrow.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,060
Hang in there just one more day, okay?

55
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,660
Is that person called Ezaki...

56
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,860
Is she going to become your new mother?

57
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,260
How nice that such a pretty person's going to be your mother?

58
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,760
My mother who died was much prettier!

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,860
She's just marrying daddy because she wants his estate.

60
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,960
Estate?

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,660
Right. Because I heard them.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
What?

63
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,760
For me?

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,860
I'm so happy! Thank you!

65
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,760
How do I look?

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
They look nice!

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,860
And, when shall we have the wedding?

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,360
Please wait a little while more.

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
Until the February show is over.

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
Are you saying you want to put all your energy into the show?

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,460
Yes.

72
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,460
I want it to succeed this time no matter what.

73
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,360
If I don't make it again this time,

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,460
I'm going to give up my career as a fashion designer!

75
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,260
My mind's made up.

76
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,660
Okay!

77
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,460
It's okay.

79
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,960
By the way, about this show, do you have enough cash?

80
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,760
If you need some...

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,460
I'm fine! If I ever need any, I won't hesitate to ask you for help.

82
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,960
So, please be prepared!

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
Keep it within reasonable range now!

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,360
Jun!

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,260
Aren't you taking everything too negatively?

86
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,660
A pretty person like her could never...

87
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,760
Genta!

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I understand how you feel. Revulsion against your new mother?

89
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Game corner?

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,060
You know the one where the supermarket in Haido-cho is?

91
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,360
Do you want to go now?

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,860
Please! I've always wanted to go there. Just this once!

93
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,360
But, you're still not fully recovered.

94
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm just fine, fine.

95
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
The cast is just for show.

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm doing just fine.

97
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,760
See! Watch!

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,960
But...

99
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,760
Are you sure you're okay?

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,960
You can go after you're discharged from the hospital tomorrow.

101
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
No way, impossible. It would never happen!

102
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,860
As soon as I'm discharged, I'll have to study with my tutor,

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,760
go to piano lessons, and English class

104
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,160
that I won't have any time to go play games.

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,860
Well, I've always felt sorry for you behind the scenes.

106
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,560
So, please!

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,960
Today's the only chance I have.

108
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,360
If we can back here in two hours in time

109
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,960
for the 12pm rounds that the doctor makes,

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,860
they'll never even miss me.

111
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,160
Hey! What do you think, Conan?

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
In order to leave the hospital, first,

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
you'd have to go past the nurse station.

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,460
And, I'm pretty sure that nurse will come by and check the room.

115
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,260
So, as long as somebody sleeps in bed in place...

116
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,660
Hey! Hey! That's absurd.

117
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,060
Come on, we're friends, let's help him.

118
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,360
Yeah, please!

119
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,860
Jun's pleading with us too.

120
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,260
If we ignore his wish,

121
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,860
it'll make a bad name for the Youth Detective Squad!

122
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,160
Right, Conan?

123
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,860
Okay...

124
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,560
Thank you!

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
Shall we decide by stone, paper, scissors, then, Conan?

126
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,560
What? Stone, paper, scissors?

127
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
What's with him?

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,460
Conan is really weak when it comes to stone, paper, scissors.

129
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,260
We don't have time, let's hurry!

130
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,360
Let's have eels over rice on the way home!

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,760
If you're treating us, Genta!

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
Yeah!

133
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,660
Well, go enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

134
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,860
Oh, no!

135
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,160
"Supermarket Moriwaki"

136
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,660
Jun?

137
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,560
Jun?

138
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,860
Hey! Hey!

139
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,260
Jun's bed is empty.

140
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,160
Do you have any idea where he went?

141
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,360
No...

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,260
Come to think of it, a bunch of children came to see him.

143
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,760
Shall I go look for them?

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,060
It's me, Yoshizawa!

145
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,660
I kidnapped the kid named Jun.

146
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,560
It's going just as you planned.

147
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,860
Now?

148
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah, he's fast asleep.

149
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,860
Where is this?

150
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,360
What happened?

151
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,460
So, you're up, sonny, eh? Get down!

152
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,060
Hurry it up!

153
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,360
What's with you? You can't move yet?

154
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,860
Where is this?

155
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,860
What're you going to do to me?

156
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
Hey...

157
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,660
Nothing much.

158
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,560
We're just going to ask your dad for ransom.

159
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,160
You mean I was kidnapped?

160
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,260
Well, I guess so.

161
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,660
Good!

162
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,160
Okay! That's it.

163
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,060
Do the same for tonight's show!

164
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,860
Let's take a break till then!

165
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,160
Fantastic!

166
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,760
No mistake you're going to join the circle of top class designers now.

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,560
I sure hope so.

168
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,760
Believe in your ability.

169
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,360
Yes, this is Kataoka.

170
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,360
What?

171
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,060
Jun's been...

172
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,360
Yes! Okay.

173
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,660
I'll head over there right away.

174
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,260
Jun... is something wrong?

175
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,660
It seems he disappeared from the hospital.

176
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,460
What? I'll go with you.

177
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,460
No, I'll go to the hospital alone.

178
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,360
You've got an important show to take care of.

179
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,760
But...

180
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,860
I'm sure everything's okay!

181
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,460
He probably went out to play some place nearby.

182
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,860
There's nothing to worry about!

183
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
I'll get in touch with you later!

184
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,860
He hasn't gone home, and I've had the nearby area checked but...

185
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,660
Do you have any idea where else he could be?

186
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,860
I wonder. His leg is hurt, so I don't think he can go that far.

187
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,760
Sachiko!

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
Did you find out where Jun is?

189
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Sachiko, go back to the show site!

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,460
Leave Jun to us.

191
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,860
What's most important to you now is...

192
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,760
Jun is more important than the show.

193
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,660
I won't go back until I know he's safe!

194
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,960
Officer Sato!

195
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
How was it?

196
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
I asked the nurses.

197
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,060
It seems that the classmates who came to see him

198
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
were Conan and the others.

199
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,660
Conan and his friends?

200
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,560
All four of them seem to have come together and gone home together.

201
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,460
Oh. Which means he didn't go out with them.

202
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,660
This is Kataoka.

203
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,460
You kidnaped Jun?

204
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,940
If you want your kid back,

205
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,040
get 30,000,000 yen in old bills ready!

206
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,040
How's Jun? Is Jun okay?

207
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,240
Yeah, he's fine.

208
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,640
I let you hear his voice right now!

209
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,540
Oh no. I don't have my voice changer either.

210
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,040
Here!

211
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,640
He wants to hear your voice.

212
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,140
What's the matter?

213
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,640
Daddy.

214
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,240
Jun!

215
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,040
Seems the kid's panicked that he's lost his voice.

216
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,540
Get the cash ready quick.

217
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,340
Oh, wait.

218
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
He hung up.

219
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,440
Mr. Kataoka, does the voice sound familiar to you?

220
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,840
No.

221
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
This is the first time I've heard his voice.

222
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,540
Jun's voice was so weak.

223
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,840
I wonder if he's really safe.

224
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,440
I can't say, but please leave the rest up to the police.

225
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,140
All right.

226
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,940
Inspector Megure! Everything's ready.

227
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,640
Thanks!

228
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,940
All we can do now is wait for the kidnapper

229
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,540
to get back in touch with us.

230
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,640
Inspector Megure!

231
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Please answer the phone, Mr. Kataoka!

232
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,540
Yes.

233
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,040
Hello, this is Kataoka.

234
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Did you get the cash ready?

235
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,640
Yes. It's ready.

236
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,440
And, you're going to give Jun back to us, aren't you?

237
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,040
Bring that money to the clock tower of the Ogane Park at 12pm!

238
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,940
12pm to the clock tower of Ogane Park. I'll be there!

239
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Hold it! You're not the one who's bringing the money!

240
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,540
We want a woman called Sachiko Ezaki to bring it.

241
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,440
What? You want her to bring it?

242
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,940
We don't hassle with anybody acting funny.

243
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,540
We feel more secure if a woman brings it.

244
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't be late.

245
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
Inspector Megure!

246
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,340
I'll go disguised as Ms. Ezaki.

247
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,540
No! Let me...

248
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,440
Ms. Ezaki?

249
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,140
I'll go!

250
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,940
Sachiko?

251
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,540
The kidnapper demanded me to go.

252
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,340
I'm sure he knows how I look.

253
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,440
But, if the worst should happen...

254
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,840
Please!

255
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,640
Nothing... nothing can be greater than Jun's life!

256
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,540
Let me go! Inspector!

257
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,140
Inspector!

258
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,740
Inspector Megure.

259
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
All right. Will you do it for us?

260
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Yes.

261
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
Inspector!

262
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,340
I know!

263
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,840
Ms. Ezaki, we will be 500m behind you

264
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,940
so that the kidnapper doesn't realize we're there.

265
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,640
I'll put this tracking device in your bag,

266
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,840
so we'll be able to locate the kidnapper right away.

267
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,540
And, if you need to get in touch with us for anything,

268
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,140
please use this to contact us.

269
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,440
Sachiko, please don't do anything reckless.

270
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,640
I promise I'll bring Jun back with me.

271
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,240
Sachiko.

272
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,340
Go on!

273
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,640
This is your grave! No use calling for help.

274
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,940
I've got to get out of here fast.

275
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,840
Understand? When the kidnapper comes in contact with Ms. Ezaki,

276
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,440
if he has Jun with him, nab him on the spot.

277
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,640
If Jun is nowhere in sight,

278
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,140
let the kidnapper go and get a hold of the whereabouts of Jun.

279
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,940
After confirming whether he is okay or not, then nab the kidnapper!

280
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,540
This is Sato at Ogane Park!

281
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,140
All the investigators are in position!

282
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,040
Good! Be very careful.

283
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,540
Takagi, come closer to me!

284
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
No, I'm just fine.

285
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,540
Don't be silly.

286
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,840
If you don't, we won't look like lovers!

287
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,640
Oh, okay.

288
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Come on, at least put your arm around me or something.

289
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
Here goes, then.

290
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,240
Like this?

291
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,840
Gosh! Get with it, will you?

292
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,040
Inspector! Ms. Ezaki's car has arrived.

293
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,240
Inspector!

294
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,940
A suspicious car is in view approaching Ms. Ezaki's car from behind.

295
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,940
It's a compact truck with the words Honeybee Courier written on it.

296
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Would a kidnapper come in a flashy car like that?

297
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,240
It stopped beside Ms. Ezaki.

298
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
Is Jun anywhere in sight?

299
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,840
No. I can't really confirm whether or not.

300
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,940
Jun? Isn't Jun with you?

301
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,340
One of my friends is watching the kid.

302
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,540
I'll give him back to you as soon as I return with this ransom.

303
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,640
Tell the police that if I'm late getting back, the kid's dead.

304
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,740
The kidnapper grabbed the bag from Ms. Ezaki

305
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,540
and has fled by truck!

306
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,240
The number plate on the truck is Shinjuku, two letters 44.

307
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,540
"Mi" for Mikasa 328.

308
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,940
On its orange colored bed, there is a large honeybee mark.

309
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,640
What shall we do, Inspector?

310
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,540
Don't get to close!

311
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,340
Chiba, get the officers in emergency position on the double.

312
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,340
-Yes, sir! -Sato, Takagi, go after him by chopper!

313
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,540
Roger!

314
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,340
A child's life is at stake, so be extremely careful.

315
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,740
Don't let him get away, no matter what.

316
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,940
Jun, isn't it about time we get going?

317
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,540
It's only a little after 11pm yet, though.

318
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,740
See?

319
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,040
Then, you can still play a lot more!

320
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,740
Next, why don't we challenge the game over there?

321
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,040
Okay!

322
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Genta, are you good at that game?

323
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Nope.

324
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,440
Something... if I can only find something...

325
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,140
Inspector! The truck's headed for Kenbashi Tunnel!

326
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,740
What's the length of the tunnel?

327
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,540
About 1km, so at this speed...

328
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,440
it'll go through it in about a minute!

329
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,140
Inspector! The truck will soon be entering the tunnel!

330
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,940
Go on ahead and wait at the exit of the tunnel!

331
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Roger!

332
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,840
It stopped.

333
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
It stopped in the center of the tunnel!

334
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,240
It won't budge with the strength of a child.

335
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,840
Darn it!

336
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,340
Maybe the kidnapper abandoned the truck.

337
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,640
Do you see anybody suspicious?

338
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,340
No, only other cars are coming out of the tunnel.

339
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,240
No humans, not even a cat for that matter.

340
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,440
Why? Why isn't it moving?

341
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Inspector, 10 minutes have gone by.

342
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,140
Okay, let's go inside the tunnel!

343
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,240
Yes, sir!

344
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,140
Darn! I've got to do something quick.

345
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,940
It was abandoned on the side of the road in the center of the tunnel.

346
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,440
Which means...

347
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,040
The kidnapper threw away the communicator

348
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,940
and got away with the cash.

349
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,440
But the Honeybee courier truck didn't come out of the tunnel.

350
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Are you sure about it?

351
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,540
Yes. The pilot of the chopper as well as I was watching carefully

352
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,640
but the Honeybee courier truck didn't come out of the tunnel.

353
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,140
Maybe he made a U-turn inside the tunnel?

354
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,440
But if so, he would be driving

355
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,340
in the opposite direction on the freeway and cause a commotion!

356
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,040
Then, are you saying that the kidnapper's car

357
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,140
disappeared in the tunnel?

358
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Another thing I don't understand is

359
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,740
how the kidnapper found out about this communicator.

360
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,540
Officer Sato, I have something I want you to check for me.

361
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,640
Yes, sir.

362
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,500
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,300
"PET bottle"

364
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,700
-In the next episode... -It's finally the time for our appearance!

365
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,360
Let's go, Takagi!

366
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,920
It's not that way! This way, Inspector!
