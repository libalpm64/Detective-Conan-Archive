1
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:06,879
And? How was it?

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,979
Huh?

3
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:11,879
You know, the connection between that boy Eisuke and Rena Mizunashi.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,479
Judging from their blood type,

5
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,779
it seems that Eisuke Hondo's older sister and Rena Mizunashi

6
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,079
are two different people.

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,879
According to the parent child booklet, Eisuke is blood type O!

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,879
In other words, his older sister who gave him blood

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,779
has to be blood type O.

10
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:26,879
And Rena Mizunashi

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,779
who's in the hospital now is blood type AB!

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,779
So, Rena Mizunashi and that boy were not siblings after all?

13
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,079
No.

14
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,679
Most probably not.

15
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,879
You're hiding something from me again, aren't you?

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,479
Cut out that scary look of yours.

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,179
I'll tell you about it as soon as I find out what's going on.

18
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,779
I'm sorry, I happened to be born with this scary face.

19
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:50,979
See you.

20
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,579
Oh. Huh?

21
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,079
"Mouri Detective Agency"

22
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,579
I'm home!

23
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,279
Well, Yoko's song is fantastic any day.

24
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,879
It's beautiful like the twittering of birds.

25
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,379
Darn, those crows, on the third floor railing again.

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,179
Hey, shut up, you guys!

27
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:25,679
Get out of here, you darn crows!

28
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:35,879
I mean, "gee little crows, what makes you cry?"

29
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,679
Sizzling hot suspense.

30
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,579
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

31
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,479
From Rena Mizunashi to the Black Organization!

32
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,679
Join hands with the FBI and with great cooperation,

33
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,879
corner those guys.

34
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,379
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,979
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,379
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

37
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:47,139
"Red and Black Crash: Coma"

38
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,239
Huh? No. It's stopped at Eisuke again?

39
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,739
Yeah! I can't get through no matter how many times I try calling.

40
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,639
I'm home!

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,739
Hi, Conan.

42
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,339
Hey, Ran! Are you listening?

43
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,605
Is something wrong with Eisuke?

44
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:01,639
Yep, we can't get hold of him
Is something wrong with Eisuke?

45
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,205
Yep, we can't get hold of him

46
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:07,105
and the message network is stalled again.

47
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,605
We want to let him know that the school event

48
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:12,305
that was scheduled to be held after the holidays, is cancelled.

49
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:16,305
Again? Since when can't you get a hold of Eisuke?

50
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,705
Right after winter vacation started. I think.

51
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:23,505
Sonoko said that the message network stopped back then at Eisuke too.

52
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:28,905
Oh, didn't Eisuke mention anything before winter vacation started?

53
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:31,305
Oh, I think he did.

54
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,805
About a clue.

55
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,205
He mentioned something about finding a clue.

56
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,905
At Haido Central Hospital!

57
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,705
What?

58
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:42,605
Haido Central Hospital?

59
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,705
Rena Mizunashi is there.

60
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:50,405
The woman named Kir who's one of the guys in black is there.

61
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,505
But, how could he have found out?

62
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,505
The FBI agents should be there tightly hiding her

63
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,805
and guarding the place so that her whereabouts wouldn't be disclosed.

64
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,205
It's not all that easy to find her.

65
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:01,605
Conan?

66
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,305
Conan!

67
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:05,405
Listen to me.

68
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,805
He found a clue, but it wasn't about his older sister.

69
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:09,805
Huh?

70
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,905
Then, what was it about?

71
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,505
His father!

72
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,905
He said he found a colleague of his father

73
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:19,105
who used to work at the same company as his father!

74
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:21,605
Eisuke looked really happy!

75
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:22,605
He said that he thinks that

76
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,605
his father whose whereabouts became unknown long ago,

77
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:28,305
was looking for his colleague and older sister.

78
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:30,205
His father's colleague?

79
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,505
You mean one of the members of the Company?

80
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:35,905
Don't tell me that people, other than the guys in black

81
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,205
are also looking for Rena Mizunashi.

82
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,405
But, it was after that,

83
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:43,205
that we couldn't get a hold of Eisuke.

84
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,605
It could be that he's been looking for his older sister together

85
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:50,205
with that person from the company since winter vacation too.

86
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:56,305
I'm sorry that I had to ask you to come out all this way, Jodie.

87
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:57,605
No problem!

88
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,305
Calling from the hospital is too dangerous

89
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,605
and besides I wanted to talk to you too.

90
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:06,505
And, what is this troublesome thing that occurred?

91
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,305
It's Eisuke Hondo!

92
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:11,005
He went to Haido Central Hospital!

93
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,605
Oh, you mean the boy that's searching for his older sister

94
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,705
who looks just like Rena Mizunashi?

95
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:18,905
It's true that he came to the hospital at the end of the year, but...

96
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,805
-Really? -Yes.

97
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,205
He seemed to be asking around at the nurses

98
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:24,405
with the picture of his older sister in hand, but...

99
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:28,505
He probably got no information and went home

100
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,505
because they knew nothing about Rena Mizunashi.

101
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:34,505
No, it's not about his older sister,

102
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:35,505
but, rather, he's saying that

103
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,605
he saw his father's colleague at the hospital!

104
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,405
His father's?

105
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:41,505
You mean, don't tell me it's has to do with the Company?

106
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:46,405
Yeah, there's a possibility that they're looking for Rena Mizunashi too,

107
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,705
although I don't really know what their purpose is yet.

108
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:52,005
It sure is troublesome if what you're saying is true.

109
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:56,905
If it's the Company, then they may know the faces of us FBI agents.

110
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,005
After all, anything's okay with them when they want to get their way,

111
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,105
so it's most likely that they'll get rough

112
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,705
even inside a hospital.

113
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:05,805
It's only natural that the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi

114
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,105
will be known to them too!

115
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:11,305
I hope all they did was stop over at Haido Central Hospital.

116
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,905
If they're already hiding some place in the hospital,

117
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:16,105
we've got to think of something fast.

118
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:19,605
It's been bothering me for some time now

119
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,105
but what on earth is the company?

120
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:23,305
From your conversation,

121
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:25,905
it doesn't seem like the usual kind of company.

122
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:29,905
FBI is called the bureau office, that is, likewise.

123
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:32,405
I think that the Company is probably a vernacular name.

124
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:35,105
It's the organization working under the direct order of the President,

125
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:38,405
that gathers information to cope with and execute national affairs

126
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:40,805
having to do with the United States, including foreign affairs.

127
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,905
In other words, you mean...

128
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:45,405
The CIA.

129
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,405
CIA?

130
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:52,205
In other words, Eisuke's father was a spy for the U.S,

131
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,505
isn't that it?

132
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,605
Not really. It's only a possibility.

133
00:07:56,605 --> 00:08:00,105
No, I'm sure he was.

134
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,205
You'd better be grateful

135
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:04,605
because I searched high and low and grabbed this info.

136
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:05,905
Which means...

137
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:08,705
His real name is Ethern Hondo.

138
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,705
He's a 2nd generation Japanese American,

139
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:14,205
who entered the CIA 30 years ago as an agent.

140
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:17,005
He immigrated to Japan three years after becoming an agent,

141
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,005
got married and stayed in Japan.

142
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:22,705
I don't know what he was looking into

143
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:24,305
but, it's most likely...

144
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,705
Information on the Men in Black.

145
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,305
Yes. If we were to believe the story

146
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:32,605
that the CIA is after Rena Mizunashi,

147
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,105
I'm sure there's no doubt.

148
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,905
But isn't it strange?

149
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,205
I would think that if Eisuke

150
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:39,005
were looking for Rena Mizunashi who is one of them,

151
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,405
that underwent surgery to look just like Eisuke's older sister,

152
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,105
the CIA would try to stop him.

153
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:48,905
True, the organization is probably looking for her whereabouts too,

154
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,605
so if it should become conspicuous, danger is inevitable,

155
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:53,505
and there's a possibility that it would also hinder CIA activities.

156
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:56,405
Above all, if Eisuke is the real son of an agent,

157
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,205
I'm sure they would stop him.

158
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:03,105
No, Eisuke Hondo did stop looking for Rena Mizunashi!

159
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,805
This winter vacation

160
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:08,205
after he said he found a colleague of his father

161
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,505
at Haido Central Hospital,

162
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,605
no one's been able to contact him.

163
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:14,005
Which means that the boy was abducted by the CIA...

164
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:17,005
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have him in their custody,

165
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:20,105
thanks to his worried father's request.

166
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:23,005
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

167
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:26,705
Because that boy's father Ethern Hondo

168
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:29,305
passed away four years ago.

169
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:36,505
The place was an unused warehouse in Yokohama.

170
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:40,505
The eye-witness was a homeless who was using the place as his lodgings.

171
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:46,505
He awoke with the sound of gun fire and looked below.

172
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,705
He saw a woman crouched over a man who had collapsed on the ground,

173
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:52,405
and then saw two other men come along.

174
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:54,305
They were both dressed in black.

175
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:56,505
One was tall with long hair

176
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:59,805
and the other was a stout man wearing sunglasses.

177
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:02,805
Gin and Vodka!

178
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:04,305
The woman who was crouched over

179
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:08,205
explained as she gasped to the two men dressed in black.

180
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,905
She grabbed the man's wrist and took his gun away.

181
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,705
Then shot him.

182
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,505
She then told them, "I didn't say a word."

183
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:25,505
"Proof that I didn't, is in the MD that the dead man is holding."

184
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:29,505
After a while, another man appeared

185
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,805
ran over to him and shouted.

186
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:36,305
Hondo!

187
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:40,005
Then the man who ran over to him was also a CIA agent?

188
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,105
But, just because the man shouted his last name,

189
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:44,205
it's not proof that the man was Ethern Hondo, is it?

190
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:47,605
The picture of Eisuke's father that you sent me.

191
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,105
I showed it to him and confirmed,

192
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,605
the man said he was sure it was him.

193
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,705
The man?

194
00:10:52,705 --> 00:10:54,105
Mr. Akai.

195
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,505
In fact, he's the one

196
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,805
who found out that Ethern Hondo was a CIA agent.

197
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,505
I don't know how he does it,

198
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:05,105
but the evidence he brings together is never wrong.

199
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,605
I wonder if the organization would leave

200
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:09,405
two eye-witnesses just like that, without doing anything?

201
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:13,705
Fortunately, it seems they weren't aware that the homeless was watching.

202
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:17,905
But, the man who ran over, was shot by the guys who were hiding

203
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,905
and the warehouse was burned down to nothing in one night.

204
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,405
I'm sure that they thought no one could make it out alive from there,

205
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:25,505
like back when it happened to me.

206
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:27,505
I was more surprised of the "woman"

207
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:29,805
who was said to be at the scene!

208
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:35,705
That homeless was shaking but he finally answered me,

209
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:37,905
saying that the woman who was crouched over

210
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:42,205
looked just like Rena Mizunashi.

211
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,505
Which means...

212
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,505
Rena Mizunashi is...

213
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:49,005
Right, she couldn't be Eisuke's older sister.

214
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:50,005
Because then it would be that

215
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:54,605
the man's real daughter shot him to death.

216
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,105
It could be that

217
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:59,705
the woman approached Ethern Hondo pretending to be his daughter,

218
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:03,505
in order to figure out how much information the CIA had on them,

219
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,905
but he saw through her and caught her.

220
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:08,905
So, she killed him instead before he had a chance to interrogate her?

221
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:14,305
I guess I'm stuck now.

222
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:15,905
I came here

223
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:18,205
wanting to ask the boy Eisuke more about his father,

224
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,305
and I was hoping that you could ask him to come.

225
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,505
I had no idea that you wouldn't able to contact him.

226
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,905
At any rate, let's hurry to Haido Central Hospital!

227
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,005
Huh? You're going too?

228
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,405
Yep.

229
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:30,905
If the people of the CIA may be hiding there,

230
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:32,305
I think that I would be of more use to you,

231
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:35,805
because they don't know what I look like, right?

232
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,015
Yes, right!

233
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,515
We'll be there in ten minutes. Bye.

234
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,615
I have the nurse that Eisuke showed the picture to waiting here,

235
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,515
just like you told me to, boss.

236
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,015
Thank you.

237
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:56,015
Hey, I thought I was your boss?

238
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:59,315
Oh, did you say something, driver?

239
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:01,415
Doesn't it bother you, though?

240
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,715
Why did that boy Eisuke disappear?

241
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:09,115
Yes, so first we get in contact with the nurse who talked to him,

242
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,715
and find a clue.

243
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:14,615
But, well, I think that the CIA has him in custody.

244
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,515
His father may have passed away,

245
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:18,115
but I'm pretty sure that there's someone among them

246
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:20,215
who knows what his son looks like.

247
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,415
No, but all Eisuke Hondo said was that

248
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,415
he saw one of his father's colleagues at the hospital.

249
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:29,115
Huh? Wait a sec.

250
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:32,015
When we were talking about the time Eisuke Hondo's father

251
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:36,315
took him to the Okonomiyaki shop when he was small.

252
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,815
Oh, isn't this the one?

253
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,115
Right, it's this picture!

254
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:46,015
Right, it was the shop his father brought the members of the CIA to.

255
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:47,515
But...

256
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,115
Come to think of it, whenever he brought his son with him,

257
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:52,315
there were always only the two of them.

258
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:57,315
Which means, he couldn't have known any of the faces of the men.

259
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:01,315
If his father never let him meet any of the members,

260
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:04,815
why'd he say, he saw one of the members at the hospital?

261
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,515
No, wrong!

262
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:11,015
Come to think of it, he did say he found a clue.

263
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,315
According to Ran, he said he found a clue,

264
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:15,715
not saw somebody.

265
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:18,715
It may not have been that he saw someone.

266
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:20,015
If so, I wonder what he meant by

267
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,715
"A clue to a colleague of his father at the Company" means?

268
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:29,415
Hold it, if what his father said at the Okonomiyaki shop

269
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,515
means, the time to dive into the Black Organization has come.

270
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:36,215
Is something the matter?

271
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:42,115
Yep, that's what Eisuke said.

272
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,715
That he found one of his father's colleagues

273
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,215
that worked for the Company.

274
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,715
You mean, he "saw" that person?

275
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:48,715
Nope.

276
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:50,415
He said that a person at Haido Central Hospital

277
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,115
was keying in the same number as the mail address

278
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,415
that his father used to key in

279
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:56,115
when he sent e-mails to his colleague at the Company.

280
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,915
Person at the Company?

281
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:01,215
If he didn't see the person yet, how did he know the e-mail address?

282
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,515
-The sound. -Sound?

283
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:06,415
It seems that his father used to call him at times

284
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:09,515
when he was on business abroad,

285
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:12,215
he used to hear the address being keyed in on the phone.

286
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:15,315
He said it sounded a lot like a melody.

287
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,415
Melody?

288
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,615
Oh, right, I'm sure it was the children's song.

289
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:28,215
Seven Baby Crows!

290
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,715
-What was that sound just now? -When he asked his father,

291
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:34,615
he was told that his father was sending out an e-mail

292
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:36,615
to a colleague at the Company!

293
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:41,415
Which means what Eisuke saw at Haido Central Hospital was...

294
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,915
The guys that may be hiding in the hospital

295
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:46,415
are not CIA agents,

296
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,315
but rather, the members of the Black Organization!

297
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,515
"Haido Central Hospital"

298
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:54,615
Oh, the members of that Organization are here at this hospital.

299
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:56,315
Yes, that's right!

300
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:59,215
But, it's still just a possibility.

301
00:15:59,215 --> 00:16:01,315
It could be that they just dropped by.

302
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,915
Is that tip off, something you can trust?

303
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:05,815
It came from Conan Edogawa.

304
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:09,115
He says that one of his acquaintances saw a person

305
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,915
sending e-mail from the Haido Central Hospital

306
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:14,915
to the boss of the Organization.

307
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:17,015
That boy again.

308
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:18,815
You're really enthusiastic, aren't you, Jodie?

309
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:22,615
At any rate, the nurse that was contacted by the boy

310
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,215
is waiting at the hospital,

311
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:29,715
so tell the investigators to stay inconspicuous until we arrive.

312
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:32,115
If they find out that we, the FBI

313
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,715
are sheltering Rena Mizunashi at the hospital,

314
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:38,715
the only string that may connect us to the Organization may be severed.

315
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,115
Roger.

316
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:54,415
The only string?

317
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:02,215
But, just lowering a string into the dark depth of the sea,

318
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:05,015
will bear no fruit.

319
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:12,815
In order to fish them out,

320
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:18,815
we need bait that will lure them out deep into our pockets and...

321
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:28,815
and a needle that will poke deep into their throats.

322
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,215
Oh, this young man.

323
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:36,915
He came at the end of the year with the picture of a woman.

324
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:40,715
Was that the picture of the announcer Rena Mizunashi?

325
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,115
Yes,

326
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:45,515
he asked me if that person was hospitalized here but...

327
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:48,015
I told him she wasn't.

328
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,215
If she were, I'm sure that the rumor of her being here

329
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:51,915
would've spread throughout the hospital immediately.

330
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:55,415
So, he was looking for Rena Mizunashi

331
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:57,715
and not his older sister, after all?

332
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,315
But, is it really true that

333
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,315
this young man's whereabouts is unknown since he came here?

334
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,915
Rather, it's more like we can't get a hold of him.

335
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,715
That's why his teacher is also looking for him

336
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:10,715
together with the people living in the neighborhood.

337
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:15,115
And, besides, Rena Mizunashi is taking a long time off, right?

338
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:18,015
So, he suspected that maybe she was sick or something

339
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,415
and hospitalized.

340
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:24,615
I mean, he's a really great fan of Rena Mizunashi, you see,

341
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,215
I think he's been looking around for her

342
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:30,015
all through winter vacation without even going home,

343
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,815
but did he say anything else?

344
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:35,915
Oh. Come to think of it, back then.

345
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,215
Somebody asked me the same question you're asking me now!

346
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:40,715
The question was,

347
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:43,815
I saw a person who looked just like Rena Mizunashi in this hospital

348
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:45,615
but is it really her?

349
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,615
I was surprised!

350
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:51,315
What did that person look like?

351
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:55,315
Well... I couldn't see very well.

352
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,915
You couldn't see?

353
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:07,815
I dropped my contacts when someone bumped into me then.

354
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:10,515
And, that's when he called out to me.

355
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,815
The voice? What sort of voice was it?

356
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:16,115
I wonder. I know it was a man's voice,

357
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:17,915
but I can't say what kind of voice it was.

358
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,415
Oh, but I think

359
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:23,715
he was a patient who was hospitalized here at the end of the year.

360
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:25,515
Although blurred, I saw the person wearing the sandals

361
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:28,115
that the shop at the hospital newly purchased,

362
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:31,015
and put on sale just around that time.

363
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:33,315
What?

364
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:35,415
Since when were those sandals sold in the store?

365
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:39,515
If I remember correctly, I think it was around December 18th.

366
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:42,815
So, I guess the guys of the organization

367
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,515
are hiding somewhere in this hospital.

368
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,515
There's no doubt about it.

369
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:50,015
"Haido Central Hospital"

370
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:52,915
I think we should move Rena Mizunashi

371
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:55,215
to another place right now!

372
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:57,415
Now that we know that the guys of the Organization

373
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:58,615
are hiding here somewhere,

374
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,715
it's too risky to keep sheltering her here!

375
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:04,115
But, if we take rash measures,

376
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:07,915
it'll be like telling the guys of the Organization that she's here.

377
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,715
If there's another hospital that we can move her to,

378
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,715
we could do something about it now, but...

379
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,115
I think it's best to keep her here, as is.

380
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,215
As is?

381
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,215
Judging from the fact that they're disguising themselves

382
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,815
as patients here and asking the nurses for hints

383
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:25,015
on the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi,

384
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,215
it shows that they're still in the process of looking for her.

385
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:31,215
It's not that they've come here knowing that she's here.

386
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,115
Besides, this could be our chance.

387
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,215
Our chance?

388
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:38,015
Yeah, to add another string to the only one we had.

389
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,915
It's true that capturing the man

390
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:43,515
before they find out about anything would be ideal but...

391
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,315
There seems to be over 20 men

392
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:49,215
who were hospitalized here at the end of the year.

393
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,115
It would be way too difficult to check on all those people

394
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:54,815
hiding our identities as FBI agents.

395
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:57,015
Moreover, it would be too time consuming.

396
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,015
If that nurse

397
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:03,315
could only recall what day the man asked her the question.

398
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:06,115
I think it was between December 18th to the 21st,

399
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:08,015
during one of these four days!

400
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,915
Pardon?

401
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:13,615
Teitan High School's winter vacation starts from December 23rd.

402
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:16,115
It seems that Eisuke talked about coming here

403
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:19,115
before winter vacation started so,

404
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:21,615
he must've come here before the 21st.

405
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,415
If the store started selling the sandals on December the 18th,

406
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,715
the only people you need to check are those

407
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:31,115
who were hospitalized before the 21st, right?

408
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:32,915
Right!

409
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:35,015
Okay, let's have the hospital

410
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:38,815
submit a list of all the patients that fall in this category!

411
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:41,515
The only other thing that bothers me

412
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:44,015
is the whereabouts of the boy called Eisuke.

413
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,215
Well, as far as the FBI is concerned,

414
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:47,715
it's more convenient that

415
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,515
he stays out of the scene as is, for now.

416
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:51,915
Having NOC's son snooping here and there,

417
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,915
could call for more trouble.

418
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,415
NOC?

419
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,415
Non Official Cover,

420
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:58,915
more commonly known as NOC!

421
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:01,915
They are secret agents who disguise themselves as ordinary citizens

422
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:04,315
in foreign countries and go about their activities!

423
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:06,415
You seem to know a lot of things,

424
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:07,915
and yet this is the first time you heard this terminology?

425
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:13,315
No, I know about it, but something about that word bothers me.

426
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,815
Non Official Cover,

427
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:18,315
more commonly know as NOC.

428
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,415
There's no reason they would leave a boy

429
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:22,915
who knows their boss' e-mail address, as is,

430
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:25,515
without doing anything.

431
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,915
Well, if you're worried as to whether NOC's son is safe,

432
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,815
he's probably not.

433
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,400
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,620
Mark of a wound.

435
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,980
That's it, for children's time.

436
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,120
Kids, on your mark and go to bed.

437
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:56,610
Mark out the course.
