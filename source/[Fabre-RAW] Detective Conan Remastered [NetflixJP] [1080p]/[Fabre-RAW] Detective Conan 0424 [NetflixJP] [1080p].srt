1
00:00:02,056 --> 00:00:03,656
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:05,556
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:06,856
A fun-filled masquerade party suddenly

4
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,956
takes a turn and turns into a homicide!

5
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:10,956
A sad story of a clown.

6
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:12,456
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,356
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,356
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,222
How about it? Pretty good, don't you think?

10
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,722
You do know that huge theme park called "Anime Land", right?

11
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:09,022
I was appointed one-day theme park chief there.

12
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,322
I figured that it's no fun just doing the part,

13
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,522
so I decided to add some "fizz" to it.

14
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:15,422
That surprise "fizz" that I added took on extremely well.

15
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:18,222
And I was asked to be one-day theme park chief the next year,

16
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,722
the year following and forever!

17
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,722
I'm going to come rent costumes again when the time comes

18
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:22,922
so don't go out of business!

19
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,722
Nobody said anything like that.

20
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:32,322
Because you're strange old man, they couldn't differ you from an idiot.

21
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:40,122
"Picture Mail from a Clown"

22
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:43,822
I guess this is good.

23
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:46,022
I'll give it to you as a gift, with my autograph on it.

24
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:47,522
No, thank you.

25
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:50,022
What's this dance?

26
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:53,022
This was taken around 3 pm when the earthquake occurred.

27
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,822
It sure was a big shake.

28
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:57,022
I'm sure that was about five on the the seismic intensity scale.

29
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,922
Are you all one-day theme park chief?

30
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:07,022
"Minoru Kijima (30)" -No.

31
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,822
"Make-up artist" -We going to a party.

32
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,222
They're engagement party for these two!

33
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,422
Oh, a costume party?

34
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,622
"Jiro Ishikawa (28)" -Well, it's quite embarrassing, though.

35
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:18,622
"Cameraman" -But, there's a person saying that "a mere party is boring."

36
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:20,722
"Yoko Nakamura (25)" -We can't refuse the request,

37
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,422
"Fashion model" -because she's a big shot.

38
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,722
Smiling on the outside, crying on the inside.

39
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:28,322
Tears are hidden by make-up, just like a clown.

40
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,222
Oops, I forgot the hat.

41
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:34,622
I wonder what kind of costume I should wear next time.

42
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:36,422
This? No, maybe this...

43
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,422
It's from Ms. Umeda.

44
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,322
It's from the host of the party.

45
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,422
I was surprised at the earthquake

46
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:47,422
but preparations for the party are in progress.

47
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,722
The chief editor hates earthquakes.

48
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,322
She said, "This is my costume."

49
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:55,422
A clown.

50
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,922
Yes, this is the chief editor, Umeda.

51
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,922
Great, don't you think?

52
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:02,522
It's a mail from Ms. Umeda

53
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,522
saying that she'll leave the door open,

54
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:06,222
so to come in on your own.

55
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:07,622
Roger.

56
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,522
It's 4.30 pm now, so we'll get there at 5 pm sharp.

57
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,922
A party.

58
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:20,022
Well then, kid.

59
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:21,622
Let's go play pachinko,

60
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:24,322
and go eat something good afterwards.

61
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:25,922
Yes!

62
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,322
Excuse me.

63
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,422
Could you keep this for us too?

64
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,122
Okay.

65
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:32,322
See you then.

66
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,722
Bye.

67
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:42,622
What about going to eat something good?

68
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:45,422
You used all the money you had on pachinko.

69
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:47,422
Talk about heartless.

70
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:50,722
What's the big deal about picking up balls on the floor?

71
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:52,922
What a wretched world, really.

72
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,922
I wonder who's more wretched.

73
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:09,922
Yes. A picture of a woman dressed in a clown outfit was displayed

74
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:13,022
on the women's cell phone at around 4.30 pm.

75
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:27,322
The cause of death is suffocation from the neck being choked.

76
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:29,222
In other words this is murder by strangulation.

77
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:32,922
This is the woman I saw on the display of the cell phone.

78
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:38,422
Mr. Mouri had seen the mail from the victim at 4.30 pm.

79
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,622
The dead body was found at 5 pm.

80
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:43,022
Judging from various angles,

81
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:47,022
I guess it would be safe to say that she was killed between 4 pm and 5 pm.

82
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:49,422
Hey, what do you mean by various angles?

83
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:52,722
Conan, sticking your nose in from the side again.

84
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:54,922
I'm sorry, just ignore him.

85
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,622
Oh no, it's okay.

86
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:00,922
The muscles of people become hard when they die.

87
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:04,022
It's rigor mortis, right? I read about it in a book.

88
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:08,222
The body usually starts to harden from about 2 hours after death.

89
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:10,622
But, if outside during summer

90
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:14,022
or in places that are warm like this room

91
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:16,022
where the heater is on, it starts much faster.

92
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:21,422
But, this person has begun to harden at all.

93
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:25,622
Which means not much time has passed since she died.

94
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:27,122
Since it's 5.30 pm now,

95
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:30,122
we can deduced that she died after 4.30 pm,

96
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,222
that is, about an hour ago.

97
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:36,322
And, who is this Ms. Umeda?

98
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:40,322
A competent chief editor of a women's fashion magazine.

99
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:44,922
Ms. Kijima who found the corpse is a popular make-up artist.

100
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,522
The victim is the one who found him

101
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:50,022
and brought him to where he is now.

102
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:52,022
And, Mr. Ishikawa who was with her,

103
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:53,722
is a cameraman for that magazine.

104
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:57,622
Likewise. Yoko Nakamura, who was with her used to be a fashion model.

105
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,222
Rings and necklaces seem to be missing

106
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,922
from the victim's jewelry box.

107
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:11,322
Maybe the young man that we saw stole them?

108
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:14,122
Did they see the killer?

109
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:18,322
They seem to have seen a man fleeing out of the condo

110
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:19,522
when they all got here.

111
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,222
It was 5 pm.

112
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,422
Just when we parked the car in the parking lot

113
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,722
and was heading for the condo.

114
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:30,722
He was wearing a black leather jacket.

115
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:33,522
A robber?

116
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,222
Looked like it.

117
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,622
Or, maybe a killer.

118
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,122
Come off it, Mr. Kijima.

119
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:40,322
He's only kidding.

120
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:44,022
Good evening, Chief editor.

121
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,322
Wow, it sure is warm.

122
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,722
It's cold outside, so it sure is relieving.

123
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,022
What's this?

124
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:52,022
Footprints? Don't tell me that!

125
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:58,122
Chief editor, there are footprints on the corridor,

126
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:00,222
but what seems to be the matter?

127
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,822
Chief editor?

128
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:05,022
Chief editor!

129
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:08,322
Don't move around!

130
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,622
We don't want to erase the killer's footprints.

131
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,722
Where'd the phone?

132
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:19,622
Darn!

133
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,522
The killer did this.

134
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:23,622
I didn't bring my cell phone with me.

135
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:24,722
What about the chief editor's cell phone?

136
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,622
There' s no way it would be here.

137
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,222
Ishikawa, let's us two split up

138
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:31,122
and go look for a public phone.

139
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:34,722
No, we can't leave Yoko alone here.

140
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,522
Please stay here, Mr. Kijima.

141
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:42,122
So, they both went to look for a public phone.

142
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,922
It wasn't easy to find.

143
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,622
But we finally found one in front of the station.

144
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:51,422
The case was reported to the police at 5.15 pm.

145
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:54,122
We arrived here at 5.30 pm,

146
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,522
and Ms. Umeda was already dead.

147
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:00,322
How come nobody had their cell phone with them?

148
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,522
You had it on you a while ago, miss.

149
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:05,722
You keep out of this, kid.

150
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:09,022
Yes, that's what I was just about to ask you too.

151
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,422
We left our phones at the rental costume shop

152
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:12,122
that we were at a while ago.

153
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:15,822
The chief editor never liked cell phone all that much.

154
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,222
Because she would be chased around everywhere at all times.

155
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:20,022
Especially when it came to parties,

156
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:23,422
she never allowed people to bring in their cell phones.

157
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:25,522
She even cautioned me against receiving e-mails.

158
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,922
I see.

159
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:29,222
About 5 years ago,

160
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:32,022
you could find public phones almost anywhere.

161
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,622
But now, they're not easy to find.

162
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:36,322
It sure has become a strange world.

163
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,722
I don't know if it's gotten more convenient or not.

164
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:40,422
So much for that.

165
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,222
Whether the killer knew about it

166
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:43,422
or whether it was a mere coincidence,

167
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:46,622
he entered this roomed that happened to be unlocked.

168
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,222
Ms. Umeda was absorbed in making preparations

169
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,022
that she didn't notice the killer sneaking up on her.

170
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,822
She was attacked from behind

171
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,622
when she was setting the things for this seat.

172
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,422
I'm sure she would've noticed

173
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,522
if someone came in from the front door.

174
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,022
And, she fled.

175
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:22,622
But there are no signs of struggle in this room.

176
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,622
The room is in exactly the same condition

177
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:25,722
it was when you all got here, rigtht?

178
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:28,622
Right, I recalled a scene

179
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,022
in a mystery program that was on TV.

180
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,322
I don't know!

181
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:35,122
I didn't do it!

182
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:37,322
I didn't do anything.

183
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:38,722
It's him! He's the one!

184
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,422
He's the one that came running out of the condo!

185
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:43,922
I saw him at the park in front of the station

186
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,822
and since he looked jittery,

187
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:48,922
I questioned him, then he tried to flee on me,

188
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,722
"Masataka Shimizu (25)" -so I nabbed him on the spot.

189
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:53,622
"Underemployed" -I don't know anything.

190
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:56,122
He had these on him.

191
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,322
Officer Sato,

192
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,922
could you have Mr. Kijima and the others take a look at this?

193
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,122
Yes, sir.

194
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:04,222
It matches exactly even the way the sole has worn away.

195
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,422
Yes, there's not mistake about it.

196
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:11,022
These are all her favorite jewelry.

197
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,622
Thank you very much.

198
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,822
Please wait here just a little while more.

199
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,422
You were asked to do so, on the Internet?

200
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:21,122
Yeah, I just happened to find something good written.

201
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:24,122
The content of the job was to come here at 5 pm,

202
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:26,722
and take the jewelry that is on the table

203
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:29,122
to the park in front of the station.

204
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,122
Stop making up stories.

205
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,022
You killed her because you were after cash, isn't that it?

206
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:34,522
No!

207
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:38,222
When I got here that clown was already dead!

208
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:40,822
I fled because I didn't want to get involved.

209
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:45,522
What a stubborn guy.

210
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,622
But, isn't it strange

211
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:49,522
that he didn't flee too far away from the scene,

212
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,222
and stayed sticking around the park?

213
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:54,922
It could be that he was really hired by somebody.

214
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:01,922
Serving one-day theme park chief can sure be tiring.

215
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,222
I'm starting to get sleepy.

216
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,922
Hey, hey. He fell asleep.

217
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:17,622
Beef stew.

218
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:23,822
It's cold.

219
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:25,922
The fire's been out for quite some time.

220
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:28,122
But the dial shows that it should've been on simmer.

221
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,222
Officer, please believe me.

222
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,322
All right.

223
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:35,022
What's this?

224
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,922
What's the matter?

225
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,622
Conan. Be quiet.

226
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:41,722
Mr. Mouri's going to start his show soon, isn't he?

227
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,822
I wonder.

228
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:46,722
Nothing's going to start, because he's really asleep this time.

229
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,822
It's the usual.

230
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:51,622
By the way, do you happen to know what this is?

231
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,522
This is...

232
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:57,222
I asked the manager of this condo about it,

233
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,622
and was told that it's an earthquake detector to switch off the gas.

234
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:01,522
An earthquake detector?

235
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:03,722
Yes, when an earthquake occurs it will automatically

236
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,622
switches off the gas to prevent fire.

237
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:09,622
Ms. Umeda seems to have requested to have it installed yesterday.

238
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,922
It switches the gas off when it detects a intensity of 3.

239
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:14,622
Oh, it probably switched off because of the earthquake in 3 pm,

240
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:16,922
and she forgot to turn the fire back on.

241
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,322
She forgot to turn the fire back on?

242
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,222
Rather, maybe she couldn't.

243
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:25,722
She may have been dead by 3 pm when the earthquake occurred.

244
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,522
But, the estimated time of death is between 4.30 pm to 5 pm.

245
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,222
If she died around 3 pm,

246
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,522
rigor mortis would've already happened

247
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,522
when Inspector Megure and the others got here at 5.30 pm.

248
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,022
The heater was on in this room,

249
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:44,022
and rigor mortis would've occurred even faster.

250
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,422
However, there were no signs of rigor mortis at all.

251
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:48,222
What does this mean?

252
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:50,322
Was it left in a cold place?

253
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,422
It can't be.

254
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:57,822
But the only cold place thinkable in an ordinary house is...

255
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,922
In order to delay rigor mortis...

256
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:08,522
What're you looking for?

257
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,222
Shall we help you look for it?

258
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:13,722
No, I'm fine. I'll look for it myself.

259
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:21,922
There's no space under the bed.

260
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:23,922
It's also impossible in the closet.

261
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,422
Could it be here?

262
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:38,622
Hey, is there a ladder in this house?

263
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:40,722
A ladder? I don't know.

264
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:43,222
Wait, it should be on the veranda.

265
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:45,022
I used it to take pictures last week.

266
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,922
On the veranda, right? Thank you.

267
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,022
It's grease paint.

268
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:53,322
It's still new.

269
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,222
It's so cold.

270
00:14:58,222 --> 00:14:59,822
Conan? Where's Conan?

271
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,922
Artificial hair?

272
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,922
The ladder was not needed.

273
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:15,022
That person's the killer!

274
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:26,865
Please wait, officer.

275
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,565
Please believe me.

276
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:33,565
You came here. But, you didn't kill the victim.

277
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,165
Who's going to believe something like that?

278
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,965
We'll hear you out all you want at headquarters.

279
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:41,565
Hey, Officer Takagi!

280
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,665
Officer, may we be excused too?

281
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:47,765
I guess so. You may go.

282
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,665
What a disaster.

283
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,365
Your costume party's gone down the drain.

284
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:55,565
More than that, you've lost a precious person...

285
00:15:58,565 --> 00:15:59,565
Mr. Mouri.

286
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,865
I wonder if he just fell asleep again?

287
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:06,765
No, the previous one was just a rehersal.

288
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,665
Now, let me show you the Sleeping Kogoro cut the Gordian knot.

289
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:17,165
Mr. Kijima, we can't have you leaving just yet.

290
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:19,665
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

291
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:24,465
Mr. Ishikawa, where at what time did you meet Mr. Kijima today?

292
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:27,365
At 3 pm in front of the Beika Department.

293
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:30,165
Mr. Kijima, before 3 pm,

294
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:32,165
where and what were you doing?

295
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:35,065
Well, I was doing a lot of things.

296
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:37,965
It sort of sounds like you're checking on my alibi?

297
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,265
Exactly, I'm checking on your alibi.

298
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:44,365
Inspector, Mr. Shimizu who was brought in a while ago

299
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,665
is not the killer.

300
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,665
The one who killed Ms. Umeda is

301
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,465
Mr. Kijima, over there.

302
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:54,165
Just what are you talking about, all of a sudden?

303
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:57,065
Mr. Kijima was with us right through.

304
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:01,165
He had no time to kill the chief editor.

305
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:03,065
The only time we acted separately

306
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,065
was when we went to look for a public phone.

307
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:10,065
But, chief editor was already dead at that time.

308
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:15,265
No, Ms. Umeda was killed much earlier.

309
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:18,765
Most probably, even before you both met Mr. Kijima.

310
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:22,965
But the estimated time of death is between 4.30 pm to 5 pm.

311
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,365
And besides,

312
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:27,765
didn't you see the mail from Ms. Umeda too?

313
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:33,865
All he did was use Ms. Umeda's cell phone.

314
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:36,565
It doesn't necessarily mean that she sent it herself.

315
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:40,865
But, Mr. Mouri, rigor mortis hadn't started.

316
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:44,265
Ms. Umeda's body was not in this room.

317
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:48,865
It was somewhere in a cold place until just before you came here.

318
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:51,965
In order to delay rigor mortis.

319
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,565
Just what are you talking about!

320
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,865
I saw the dead body here together with everyone else!

321
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:59,865
What was that dead clown that we saw supposed to be then?

322
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:05,865
A doll with the make-up of a clown of a size similar to Ms. Umeda.

323
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,865
Who is the one that suggested today's party was to be

324
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:10,965
a costume party, in the first place?

325
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,065
The chief editor.

326
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:17,065
Mr. Ishikawa, did the editor tell you directly?

327
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:21,965
No, Mr. Kijima told us that the editor said so.

328
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:24,765
By the way, Mr. Kijima.

329
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:26,965
Did you know that gas appliances in this house

330
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:30,165
were equipped with an earthquake detector device?

331
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,565
Earthquake?

332
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,965
You didn't know, did you?

333
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:36,765
Officer Sato, will you bring the pot

334
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,365
with the half-cooked stew in it over here?

335
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:39,465
Yes, sir.

336
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,665
Please explain the contents of the pot to us.

337
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,565
She seems to have been making beef stew,

338
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:53,265
but it is not cooked yet at all.

339
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,765
If left as is, I don't think it would've been ready

340
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,465
for the party to be held at 5 pm.

341
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:01,665
Ms. Umeda was making preparations to make it in time for the party.

342
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:02,965
As proof of this,

343
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:06,465
the dial of the gas stove was set at simmer.

344
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:09,965
She was probably planning to cook it slowly on simmer.

345
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:13,665
However, the fire went out because of the earthquake detector.

346
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:17,065
But, she never turned the gas stove back on.

347
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,465
Rather, she couldn't.

348
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:22,265
Why? Because she was already dead.

349
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:25,265
Mr. Kijima, killed by you.

350
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,665
What proof do you have?

351
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,265
This is ridiculous, I'm going home!

352
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:33,365
Mr. Mouri hasn't finished what he is saying.

353
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,965
Mr. Kijima, before meeting with Mr. Ishikawa and Yoko,

354
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:40,365
you came here strangled and killed

355
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,865
Ms. Umeda who was absorbed in making preparations,

356
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:46,765
from behind and switched her

357
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,165
with the doll you had prepared, beforehand.

358
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,465
Why did you do that?

359
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,565
Yes, you did so because

360
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:58,065
you had to leave Ms. Umeda's body in a cold place.

361
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,765
In order to make everyone believe

362
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,865
that she was killed before you all arrived,

363
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:06,265
you couldn't leave her body in a room that was heated.

364
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:11,865
Mr. Kijima, you left the room without turning off the gas

365
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:14,265
because you had to make sure that the stew was ready

366
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:17,565
when Ms. Umeda's body was found later.

367
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,865
However, there was an earthquake at about 3 pm,

368
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,965
and the gas stopped.

369
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:25,465
Unaware of this, you went shopping,

370
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,165
then went to the rental costume shop.

371
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,965
With Ms. Umeda's cell phone that you had taken from her,

372
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,565
you sent the mail just to make

373
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,765
it look as if she were alive.

374
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,265
And finally, made everyone give you their cell phones.

375
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,865
Then you tried to go look for a public phone

376
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,065
together with Mr. Ishikawa.

377
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:49,065
But, that was already what you had calculated beforehand.

378
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:51,765
You knew that Mr. Ishikawa would not leave his girlfriend behind

379
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,065
with a corpse.

380
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,365
That is, you remained in the room,

381
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:57,265
under extremely natural circumstances.

382
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,465
You then, finally brought the actual body of Ms. Umeda

383
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:02,665
that you had hidden out on the veranda inside,

384
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:05,065
and got rid of the doll.

385
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:11,065
The grease paint of the make-up of that clown...

386
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:13,465
Was found on the curtain.

387
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:14,665
That's a lie!

388
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,365
It's all just assumption.

389
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,965
You have no proof!

390
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,765
There is proof.

391
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,965
Please go out to the veranda.

392
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,065
Officer Takagi.

393
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:28,565
Mr. Kijima, this is your car, isn't it?

394
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:43,765
Darn!

395
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,965
That woman's to blame!

396
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,265
It's true that she brought me to where I am now.

397
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,765
But, each time I find a new girlfriend she gets in the way.

398
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:53,065
She tells me that if I split with her,

399
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:56,965
she'll make sure that I can't find a job in this line of work.

400
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,965
I was a indeed a clown.

401
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,265
No more than a clown.

402
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:06,265
That always hid my true feelings under my make-up.

403
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:39,665
"Mouri Detective Agency"

404
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:42,465
One-Day Chief of Firefighters?

405
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:44,565
He sure never learns.

406
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,365
Maybe this is...

407
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,965
Just as I thought.

408
00:23:54,665 --> 00:24:00,265
"Firefighters"

409
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,033
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,433
"Transmitter and wire-tap"

411
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,133
The next episode is a special edition most fitting

412
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,433
for the opening of the 10th year!

413
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,137
We will finally make contact with the Black Organization!
