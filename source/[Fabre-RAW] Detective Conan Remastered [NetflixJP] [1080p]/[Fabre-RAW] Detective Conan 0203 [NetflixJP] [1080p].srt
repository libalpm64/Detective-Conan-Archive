1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,040
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,740
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,340
Today's stage is at a hotel in the highlands.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,240
A nasty customer attracts an unwanted case.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
He looks through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,090
Excuse me, I'd like to go to Hotel Arimori.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,590
Oh, cross this bridge and go straight down the road.

11
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,490
Thank you very much.

12
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,490
Dad, how did you find a hotel in a place like this?

13
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,890
This place is well known for beer that is distinct of this area.

14
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,690
Pops is after liquor after all.

15
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,590
-It's over there! -We've finally arrived!

16
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,990
"The Black Wings Of Icarus (Part 1)"

17
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,790
Welcome.

18
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,590
I am Mouri, and I have reservations here.

19
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,690
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, I believe.

20
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,590
We've been expecting you.

21
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,490
I am Arimori, the manager here.

22
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,390
Yes, nice to be here.

23
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,990
Please fill in this card.

24
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,990
Welcome...

25
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,490
You two are...

26
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,890
the ones that were involved in the case of the cursed mask.

27
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,990
Thank you so much for all you did for us back then.

28
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,190
What brings you here?

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,090
An acquaintance introduced them to us.

30
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,090
They were both looking forward to seeing you, too.

31
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,490
I hope there are no cursed things here.

32
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,490
I'm Shiromoto, and I have reservations here.

33
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,990
Welcome.

34
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,790
Mr. Shiromoto...

35
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,090
Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto?

36
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,190
You have reservations for two?

37
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,790
Yes. My wife and I.

38
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,190
I'm sure she'll be here in a minute.

39
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,090
I don't know if it's some problem that the producer has or what,

40
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,690
but he has no right to tell me to give my part up just like that!

41
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,990
What? You're headed this way?

42
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,390
You don't have to come!

43
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,590
Gosh!

44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,490
She's actress Chizuru Bizen.

45
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,490
Yeah.

46
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,990
You, just what is the meaning of this?

47
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,090
Huh?

48
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,090
I heard it was a nice place,

49
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,690
and I'm brought all the way out in the mountains!

50
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,690
It's a nice quiet place.

51
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,290
I can't stand to think that I'm going to have

52
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,990
to spend 5 days together with you!

53
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,090
Front desk clerk. Please give me a separate room.

54
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,190
But...

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,590
You can give my wife the suite that we reserved.

56
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,390
And get me another room.

57
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,090
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,690
Take care of my bags, will you?

59
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,690
Gosh! They don't even have an elevator!

60
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,690
She sure is different from what she portrays

61
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,490
to be on TV and in the movies.

62
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,090
Right.

63
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,790
Minaho and Honami, please show them in.

64
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,190
Yes, sir...

65
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,990
This way, please.

66
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,390
Mr. Mouri. If it's all right with you,

67
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,290
would you like to rest a while in the restaurant?

68
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,490
The restaurant?

69
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,190
We can serve you some cold herb tea if you'd like.

70
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,290
How nice!

71
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,490
Dad, let's drop in for a rest.

72
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,190
All right.

73
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,990
I'd prefer a shot to herb tea though.

74
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,790
What a nice restaurant!

75
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,290
Welcome.

76
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,290
She is our chef.

77
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,790
I am Shinobu Shimon. Welcome to our restaurant.

78
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,790
She designed everything

79
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,290
from the layout to interior of this restaurant.

80
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,490
Wow!

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,890
It is my wish that our guests enjoy their meal

82
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,490
in a relaxed atmosphere,

83
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,990
with dishes made of ingredients that are unique of this district.

84
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,890
I just can't wait for dinner time.

85
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,490
I hear that you've got some really good local beer here.

86
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,890
Of course, we've got that ready for you too.

87
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,590
Shinobu, please serve our guests some herb tea.

88
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,090
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,390
I'd like to taste some of that local beer.

90
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,590
Wait till night time!

91
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,190
This sure is good!

92
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,090
Dad, why don't you stop drinking and eat something?

93
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,990
This soup is really good.

94
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,290
I've never tasted such lousy soup!

95
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,290
What?

96
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,690
And you claim to be a chef?

97
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,390
Cut it out, Chizuru.

98
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,890
You stay out of this!

99
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,190
Would you please tell me what you don't like about the soup?

100
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,290
What I don't like?

101
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,090
A guest is saying it tastes terrible!

102
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,890
Can't you at least apologize?

103
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,090
I am very sorry!

104
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,690
I'll bring you a new bowl of soup immediately.

105
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,790
Shinobu.

106
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,490
Mr. Arimori!

107
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,390
Understood.

108
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,490
That's what you should've done in the first place.

109
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,690
I heard from my husband

110
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,390
that you are the renown detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

111
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,490
It's an honor to meet you all.

112
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,390
I... I am the one who is honored!

113
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm always looking forward to

114
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,990
your great capacity of solving cases.

115
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,790
I am Chizuru's husband, Shiromoto.

116
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,890
Since I'm here on an inspection tour

117
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,490
of the development of Leisure Land,

118
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,890
we've decided to spend a holiday here while we're at it.

119
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,890
Oh, so you're a business man.

120
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,490
So, the rumor about the development was true after all.

121
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,690
Huh?

122
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,490
There are unusual butterflies

123
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,690
inhabiting this highland area, as well as alpine plants.

124
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,590
What are your plans on the preservation of all these things?

125
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,290
As to that, we are planning to have a discussion

126
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,690
with the local people here in time.

127
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,390
Heck with the locals!

128
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,390
There are people who are all worked up

129
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,690
about preserving nature and all that anywhere.

130
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,990
It's about cash, plain cash.

131
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,290
What a thing to say, Chizuru.

132
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,890
Did I say something upsetting?

133
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,990
I'll divorce you any time if you want me to.

134
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,590
But I wonder if you can pay me alimony

135
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,190
in your state of affairs right now?

136
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,390
Chizuru!

137
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,590
Chizuru, please, just this time!

138
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,090
Please forget about the part! Please!

139
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,490
You're still talking nonsense like that?

140
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,490
For what reason in the first place?

141
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,290
Well, Chizuru, I can't talk about that at here.

142
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,690
Never mind! Just tell me!

143
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,790
The sponsor doesn't want you.

144
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,790
They want somebody who's younger...

145
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,590
Rather, they want to use Reika,

146
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,890
who debuted last year, since her popularity is on the rise.

147
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,190
They say they won't dish out the cash otherwise.

148
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,990
Reika belongs to our production too.

149
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,490
So if this movie goes down the drain,

150
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,090
we'll be thrown into hot water.

151
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,990
Please try to understand, Chizuru!

152
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,190
What? What's with that look on your face?

153
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,790
I'll bet you'll all wishing that I were gone!

154
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,090
Okay, I'll die just like you want me to!

155
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,890
Chizuru!

156
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,090
She's troublesome.

157
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,990
Well, don't let it bother you too much.

158
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,290
Is this you, Mr. Arimori?

159
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,290
Huh?

160
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,290
See, that picture...

161
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,790
Mr. Arimori is in the middle

162
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,190
and the one to the very right is Shinobu, right?

163
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,190
Yes, that's right.

164
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,190
We've been doing hand-gliding together.

165
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,290
Hand-gliding?

166
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,690
We used to be able to hand-glide

167
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,090
in the highlands at the peak of a mountain before.

168
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,090
We can't do so anymore

169
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,090
because of all the developments that have been going on.

170
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,190
That's too bad.

171
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,690
I used to do it too when I was young.

172
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,190
Who is the man that is standing to the left of you, Mr. Arimori?

173
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,190
Huh?

174
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,790
Oh, that's my younger brother.

175
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,990
We used to fly a lot together in the past.

176
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,890
We haven't flown for 5 years already.

177
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,390
The hand-gliders are left stored in the storage on the roof.

178
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,190
Conan, let's go to the highlands tomorrow.

179
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,290
It's just perfect for the sketch you have to do for your homework.

180
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,390
Okay!

181
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,190
Pops is snoring so loud that I can't sleep.

182
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,890
I'm going to go buy some juice.

183
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,190
Gosh, I can't reach the slot!

184
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,090
Cut it out, won't you?

185
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,190
What on earth did I do anyway? I have nothing to do with it!

186
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,290
I wonder why Chizuru's so angry?

187
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,880
"Next morning, 9 am"

188
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,280
Mr. Shiromoto.

189
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,480
How is Chizuru?

190
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,780
I'm sorry about what happened last night.

191
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,280
She always like that, so please don't let it bother you.

192
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,880
I'm sure that she'll soon...

193
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,280
Chizuru...

194
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,580
Well, I mean...

195
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,080
Hey, lady. You know last night...

196
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,280
How rude to address her like that!

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,780
Please don't let his remark bother you.

198
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,580
Oh, no.

199
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Gosh! What am I supposed to do?

200
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,880
It's impossible to convince her now.

201
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,180
What do you say we go fishing together

202
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,280
while we wait for her to cool off?

203
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,080
My work schedule starts from tomorrow,

204
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,580
so I was planning to spend the whole day fishing today.

205
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,180
I'll lend you a fishing pole if you need one too.

206
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,580
Yes, I'd like to go with you.

207
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,380
Dad, let's go to the highlands at the top of the mountain.

208
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
You guys go on by yourselves!

209
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,780
I've got an important mission to carry out.

210
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
A mission?

211
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,280
First, I've got to watch Yoko Okino's new release promotion video.

212
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,580
Then, I'm going to watch her concert video

213
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,680
which I got a hold of by a top secret method.

214
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,780
Furthermore,

215
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,780
I've got to watch the rerun of Yoko s drama special.

216
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,680
Dad, what on earth did you come all the way here for?

217
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,080
The rerun is broadcasting only in this district.

218
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,580
So, you came all the way here to watch it.

219
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
If you don't mind,

220
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,280
would you like me to show you up the mountain?

221
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Huh?

222
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,380
That would be a great help!

223
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,180
Oh, right! Why don't you go along with them, too, Shinobu?

224
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,780
-Huh? -I'll keep watch over the hotel.

225
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,080
But I have to get everyone's meal ready, so...

226
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,380
As for lunch, all you have to do is

227
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,580
leave us some box lunches or something.

228
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,180
We're going out too, so box lunch will be fine.

229
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,380
But I still have to get dinner ready.

230
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,280
Why don't you have barbecue out in the yard then?

231
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,780
That'll save you the trouble of preparation, won't it?

232
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,280
Since my wife gave you a bad time last night,

233
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,480
why don't you go out today for a change and enjoy?

234
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,580
We can handle preparations for the barbecue for you...

235
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,180
We aren't expecting any guests today,

236
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,180
so why don't we accept their kindness and go?

237
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,980
Go ahead...

238
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,380
Okay, thank you so much.

239
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,180
It'll only take about 15 minutes to the lake by car.

240
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,880
"Start off time, 10 am" -Do you know the way?

241
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,980
Yes, thank you.

242
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,780
You'll get better catch after sundown there.

243
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,580
Okay, we'll take our time and enjoy fishing till night then.

244
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,680
Bye!

245
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
I'll follow from behind using the van

246
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
after I check if all the doors are locked,

247
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,480
so you go on ahead.

248
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,180
Please hurry, okay?

249
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,280
Sure.

250
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm sure that Chizuru will start feeling better

251
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,280
if she came out with us instead of staying locked up.

252
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Mission number 1!

253
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,780
Watch Yoko's new release promotion video

254
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,480
and master her new song completely!

255
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,980
Yoko!

256
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,680
Mr. Mouri.

257
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
Yes?

258
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,980
These are the master keys. I'll leave them to you

259
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,080
Sure thing.

260
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,180
Gosh, dad's hopeless!

261
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,980
Mr. Arimori is not here yet?

262
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,880
Huh?

263
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,980
There he is.

264
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,780
"10:50 am, at the highlands"

265
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,580
The wind sure feels good!

266
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,180
How wonderful!

267
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,280
Fantastic!

268
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,380
The real color of the sky is a clear blue like this one.

269
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,280
Now we know.

270
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,380
I feel like I could fly to the sun if I had wings.

271
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,680
You talk like you were Icarus, don't you?

272
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Icarus?

273
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,480
He appears in Greek Mythology.

274
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,580
Icarus, who had wings...

275
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,580
He forgot his father's warning telling him to keep from going to high,

276
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,280
and flew high,

277
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,480
believing that he could fly to the sun.

278
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,880
However, since Icarus had flown too close to the sun,

279
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
his wings could not tolerate the heat.

280
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,780
And, Icarus, whose-wings were burned,

281
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,980
went falling straight down to the ground.

282
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,080
It's a sad story.

283
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,680
How cute!

284
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Oh, it's called Miyama White Butterfly

285
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
and lives only up here in the highlands here.

286
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,780
That butterfly...

287
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,680
This butterfly cannot live unless the water is clean.

288
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,980
Yoko...

289
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,480
Love you! Love you!

290
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,580
"12:30 pm, at hotel lobby"

291
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,880
I absentmindedly forgot my lunch.

292
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
Is Chizuru still in her room?

293
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Yes. She hasn't come down since...

294
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,180
I guess I'll go check on her.

295
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,680
"1 pm, at the lakeside"

296
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,180
I wonder if Chizuru's in a better mood by now.

297
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
"1:30 pm, at hotel lobby"

298
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
How's your wife doing?

299
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,180
It seems that she's asleep

300
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,980
because she won't answer the door in spite of me knocking.

301
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,080
It's not easy having a wife who's strong willed, is it?

302
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,680
You can say that again.

303
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,180
I'm going back fishing.

304
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,780
Enjoy.

305
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,980
There!

306
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,880
"1:50 pm, at the highlands"

307
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,180
Line out! It's Conan's win.

308
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,680
What do you say, it's about time we have lunch?

309
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,780
Oh, my. It's already this time of day.

310
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,480
I'll go get our lunches.

311
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,080
"2:15 pm, at the lake" -Wow, this is a big one!

312
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,480
We've got a big catch today!

313
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Yes, very true!

314
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,880
"2:25 pm, at hotel lobby" -Yoko! Don't go that way!

315
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,580
How beautiful.

316
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Really.

317
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,980
The view of the sunset from here is always beautiful.

318
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,880
See? The building that is lighted up at the foot of the mountain

319
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
is Hotel Arimori.

320
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,680
Wow, it's so far below.

321
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,480
So, shall we start heading back?

322
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,880
Yes.

323
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,680
"6:05 pm, they head down the mountain"

324
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
What's the matter?

325
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,080
The engine seems to be in bad shape.

326
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,180
You can go on ahead.

327
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,680
Okay.

328
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,580
"7 pm, at the hotel" -We're back!

329
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,580
You should've come with us, dad.

330
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,880
The sunset was beautiful!

331
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,080
We saw a rare butterfly, too.

332
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,580
One that is said to never to come near people,

333
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,480
but that butterfly stopped on Mr. Arimori's shoulder.

334
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Yeah, okay okay!

335
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Hi, there.

336
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,980
Big catch we have here!

337
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,880
Welcome back.

338
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
How is Chizuru doing?

339
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,880
Come to think of it, she hasn't come down at all.

340
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,180
Not at all?

341
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,180
What a nuisance.

342
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,380
Mr. Mouri, could I have the master key?

343
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Yes, sure.

344
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,880
Thank you.

345
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,380
Here go the catch for today.

346
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,180
-I'll leave the rest up to you two. -Yes, Hotel Arimori.

347
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,080
Oh, Mr. Arimori.

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,880
I can't get my car started.

349
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,980
I hate to trouble you, but could I have you come pick me up?

350
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,180
Okay.

351
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,580
I will go with you, just in case.

352
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,880
I'm very sorry, Ran.

353
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,680
Mr. Mouri! Chizuru doesn't look well!

354
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,980
What?

355
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,680
I opened the door of her room with the key,

356
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,280
but the door guard is set,

357
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,680
and she won't answer no matter how much I call out to her!

358
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
Oh, no!

359
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,880
Chizuru...

360
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,380
Let's break the door open.

361
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,780
Yes, sir!

362
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,880
"7:20 pm, corpse found"

363
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,780
-Chizuru! -Chizuru!

364
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,680
Mr. Mouri, how is she?

365
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm sorry to say that

366
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,880
it's been a while since she's passed away.

367
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,780
It can't be...

368
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,980
The metal part of the door guard...

369
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,080
Scratches?

370
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,680
Don't tell me that...

371
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,080
Just as I thought.

372
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,680
Chizuru...

373
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,180
did not commit suicide!

374
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,880
She was killed by someone!

375
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,060
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,040
"Wind"

377
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,260
The case is solved in the next episode.

378
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,120
Oh, dad, you're a suspect again.
