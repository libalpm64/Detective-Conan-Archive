1
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:24,538
The love story of two police officers.

2
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:25,838
The Youth Detective Squad plays a part.

3
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:27,538
And the case takes a surprising turn!

4
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:29,138
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:30,938
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,038
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:04,093
Sorry...

8
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,993
Officer Sato?

9
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,993
What is it you want to talk to me about?

10
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,493
What do I do?

11
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,193
Officer Takagi, just get inside!

12
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:18,693
Oh, okay!

13
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,293
What it is? What in the world is it?

14
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,993
I wonder if I did something wrong again?

15
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:27,193
Officer Sato's birthday is in April.

16
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:29,993
I kept her company at karaoke too.

17
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:33,493
Don't tell me that...

18
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,193
She's going to ask me to break up with her?

19
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,593
Wait...

20
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:37,693
No way.

21
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:43,593
What?

22
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,593
I got you! You fell for it.

23
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:50,793
What?

24
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,593
How'd you like it?

25
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,393
Just great, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

26
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,793
This toy!

27
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,193
I'm going to try it on Officer Yumi next!

28
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:12,993
Officer Sato!

29
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,693
Don't tell me you brought me all the way here just to try that on me?

30
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,093
Exactly.

31
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,593
Is there anything wrong?

32
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:22,293
We're finished work and ready to go home anyway.

33
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:25,893
Come on.

34
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:28,593
Or are you saying that

35
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:31,993
I can't ask you to come with me unless I have something important to do?

36
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,993
Police Sergeant Takagi?

37
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:37,193
No.

38
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,593
They sure are in love.

39
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,493
No. They're no way close to being in love yet...

40
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:43,593
Well... They're probably going to make it soon.

41
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:45,193
No! Not for sometime yet.

42
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,993
Stop it, will you, Officer Sato?

43
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:56,693
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 1)"

44
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:00,893
Request for dispatch from the Tottori Prefectural Police?

45
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:01,993
Yeah.

46
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,293
You know of them, don't you, Megure?

47
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:08,393
The band of thieves that started raiding that area

48
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:10,193
and are now stealing nationwide.

49
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:11,993
Okay. See you.

50
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:18,893
A joint investigation headquarters was set up in Tottori

51
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:22,193
and they're asking for people from the First Investigation Division here.

52
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,693
But, Sergeant!

53
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,793
Isn't it supposed to be taken care of by the Third Division?

54
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:27,593
Have you forgotten, Megure?

55
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,793
They've also committed attempted murder in Tokyo too.

56
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:33,293
Oh, that's right.

57
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:34,893
Of course, they're sending one person from the third division

58
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,993
but they'll also be sending one from the first division.

59
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,393
Who would you recommend?

60
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,193
Well...

61
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:44,093
Someone who's single, brilliant and has robust enough

62
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,893
to tolerate the hard work in a different prefecture.

63
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,693
If that person is familiar with the area it's even better.

64
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,793
That's right.

65
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,793
Hey, Megure! Wasn't his hometown somewhere in Tottori?

66
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:57,993
Who?

67
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:01,393
What? Who do you mean?

68
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:04,093
Him. Takagi! Officer Takagi!

69
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:06,193
What? Takagi?

70
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,193
Oh, no!

71
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,193
I think he's a good candidate, don't you?

72
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:17,293
Yes, I guess so.

73
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,593
Although his appearance doesn't show it,

74
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:22,493
he's pretty sharp and I hear he's solved a lot of cases too.

75
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,893
Okay then, Sergeant.

76
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:26,993
I'll notify him tomorrow morning.

77
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,293
Thanks. That'll be a great help.

78
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:36,693
It's sad to think that he's going to go far away.

79
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:40,493
Hide's really going abroad.

80
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,593
We still don't know for sure, do we?

81
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:46,093
England is the place where soccer originated, right?

82
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,093
If you're a fan,

83
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,093
wouldn't you like to see him play at the original location?

84
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,093
That's true but...

85
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,993
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

86
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:56,693
I feel that it's a good idea to go abroad and get tough,

87
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:57,993
more so, for the World Cup.

88
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,493
That's right.

89
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,293
The World Cup.

90
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:05,993
The World Cup?

91
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:07,293
It seems like it's stopped raining.

92
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,193
Oh, true.

93
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,593
I see.

94
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:23,093
That man was heaving hard

95
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,693
and he seemed to be having a hard time.

96
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:28,193
Of course! Because he's jogging.

97
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:31,493
Come on, we'd better hurry or we'll be late for school!

98
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:32,493
She's right!

99
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,993
Let's go!

100
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:39,493
What?

101
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,893
That's what I heard. And...

102
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,193
Hey! Are you listening?

103
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:46,293
Miwako?

104
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:48,493
Oh. Yeah.

105
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,493
Oh, no! I'm barely going to make it.

106
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,393
Good morning!

107
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,593
Sorry...

108
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,593
Is there anything on my face?

109
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,693
Officer Yumi?

110
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,293
Officer Takagi.

111
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,593
Yes?

112
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:24,393
Goodbye...

113
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:26,993
Wait...

114
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,493
Just what do you mean?

115
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,893
What?

116
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:38,093
I'm going to be dispatched

117
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,293
to the joint investigation headquarters in Tottori?

118
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,993
Maybe you got the wrong person.

119
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:46,293
Stupid! You're the only Takagi here!

120
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,793
Don't play dumb!

121
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:51,793
According to Yumi, you should've gotten a call from Inspector Megure.

122
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:53,793
What? Come to think of it,

123
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:56,293
I did get a call from the inspector this morning.

124
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:59,993
I was still drowsy, so I didn't really follow what he was saying.

125
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:02,393
See. It's that phone call.

126
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:03,793
What?

127
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:08,093
But I get to come back after the case is solved anyway so...

128
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,793
You don't understand anything, do you?

129
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,293
The headquarters is pursuing the robbers

130
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,993
that are committing the serial robberies nationwide, you know?

131
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:18,593
In most cases like these, who knows how many incidents there are.

132
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:20,693
And besides, if there are several members involved,

133
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:23,193
who knows when the case'll be solved.

134
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:25,293
Well, things'll work out.

135
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:28,093
With his ability...

136
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,793
Three years will probably enough to solve the case.

137
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,593
Three years...

138
00:08:32,593 --> 00:08:34,693
Three years?

139
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:42,693
Three years. 1,095 days. 26,280 hours.

140
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:46,793
The Heavens have not forsaken me.

141
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,493
I'm happy for you!

142
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,093
The air is clean in Tottori

143
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:52,293
and you can eat all you want of Matsuba crab!

144
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:54,593
You can ride camels at the sand dunes of Tottori too!

145
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:57,793
-No, I will not! -Officer Takagi.

146
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:00,093
Officer Sato.

147
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,293
Don't forget to send me 20th Century Japanese Pears, okay?

148
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:08,993
They're my favorite.

149
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:11,193
What?

150
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:12,993
That's the word!

151
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,593
That's my favorite.

152
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,793
Matsuba Crab is our favorite.

153
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:18,993
Don't forget the camels while you're at it, okay?

154
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,393
What's with all this noise?

155
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:23,993
We've got a case!

156
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:25,093
The scene of the crime is

157
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:28,893
on the third floor of a skyscraper located on Beikacho Yonchome!

158
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,893
A man was found stabbed to death.

159
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,193
According to report by investigators,

160
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,493
the one who found the corpse seems to be a woman.

161
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:38,193
Sato and Takagi, go to the scene of the crime on the double!

162
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:39,193
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

163
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:42,293
And Megure you take care of giving orders at the scene.

164
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,493
Oh, no, well...

165
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:47,893
Please have Mr. Chosuke take care of things this time, Sergeant!

166
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:48,993
Mr. Chosuke!

167
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:50,093
Okay.

168
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,393
On the double!

169
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,393
Yes, sir!

170
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,593
Officer Chosuke!

171
00:09:56,593 --> 00:10:00,093
This is the first time I'm teaming with you, isn't it, Officer Chosuke?

172
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,993
Yeah, let's get to work.

173
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:02,993
Officer Takagi.

174
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,393
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:07,793
Mr. Chosuke is a veteran that's two years older than me.

176
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:10,093
Learn a lot from him, will you?

177
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,893
Yes, sir! Of course!

178
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,193
And...

179
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:16,293
This may be the last time he'll be teaming with you.

180
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,393
What?

181
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,593
Officer Takagi. Goodbye!

182
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:26,793
Are you serious?

183
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,748
Hide's press conference was from noon, right?

184
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,248
Oh, no!

185
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,448
We'd better hurry or we'll miss it!

186
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,848
We'll make it!

187
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,648
Hide's press conference will be the top news of today!

188
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:46,448
It'll probably be aired several times all night.

189
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:49,048
Something seems to have happened.

190
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:51,448
Yeah.

191
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:55,148
The name of the man that was stabbed is Mr. Hirotoshi Nakamoto,

192
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:57,348
age 27, an office worker.

193
00:10:57,348 --> 00:11:00,648
The murder weapon is an 18 cm knife.

194
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:02,248
The estimated time of death is

195
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:05,448
between 7 am to 7:30 am today.

196
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:12,348
You, his colleague at work, came here at 1 pm and found him dead.

197
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:13,348
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,848
I took a day off from work today

199
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:19,448
and was supposed to go with him to reserve our wedding hall.

200
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:22,048
How could something like this happen?

201
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,448
And...

202
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:26,748
Do you know of anyone who may have had a grudge against him?

203
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:30,248
"Yui Shimura" -He was the type to make enemies.

204
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:32,748
It seems the killer is an acquaintance of his.

205
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:35,348
Yes, the door was locked.

206
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:38,248
Then, will you pick out the person that you think

207
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:41,048
may have had a grudge against him from the album?

208
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,348
I'll go check the person out.

209
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,348
Can you see something?

210
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:49,148
It's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato!

211
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:50,948
So take care of it, okay?

212
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:52,748
Yes.

213
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:54,448
Did something happen?

214
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,448
I'll bet it's a homicide case?

215
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,448
Yeah, well...

216
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:03,048
Didn't it happen around a little after 7 am this morning?

217
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,148
Officer Sato.

218
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:06,748
How do you know about it?

219
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:10,348
We saw a suspicious looking person on our way to school.

220
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:12,448
On the street near this condominium!

221
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,548
Come on, Conan!

222
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:17,148
That man was just jogging and...

223
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:19,648
Remember! Just before we passed that man,

224
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,748
it stopped raining, right?

225
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:25,348
Yes. It was a rain shower that lasted about 10 minutes.

226
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:29,048
But that guy's clothes was hardly wet at all.

227
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,648
Why do you think it wasn't wet?

228
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,548
Maybe he was taking shelter from the rain somewhere?

229
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:36,248
Because it started raining while he was jogging.

230
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:39,748
And he started running again because it stopped raining!

231
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:43,948
Idiot! If he rested 10 minutes, he wouldn't be heaving like that!

232
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:48,148
In other words, he wasn't out of breath because he was jogging.

233
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:54,148
But because he was hyper from having stabbed someone in a room near here.

234
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,048
That's what you wanted to say, right, Sonny?

235
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:03,048
Is that man here?

236
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,048
What?

237
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,748
I think...

238
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,448
This man!

239
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,648
This man sort of looks like him!

240
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:13,348
That man... He's Mr. Kato, a colleague of his at work!

241
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:16,248
If I remember correctly, I heard that he was freeloading

242
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:17,548
at his friend's place.

243
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,948
Do you know where that house is?

244
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,048
Oh, yes.

245
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:24,348
What? A little after 7 am this morning?

246
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:27,548
"Akira Kato" -I was here right through.

247
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:31,048
No! You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi, aren't you?

248
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,648
What? Me? Commit murder?

249
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,848
Just what are you talking about? Out of the blue like that.

250
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,648
What's going on? Cut out the noise.

251
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:41,448
I told you to get rid of door-to-door sales, didn't I?

252
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:43,748
Oh, well... The thing is...

253
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:46,248
So, what's the problem?

254
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,348
What?

255
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:50,048
-What? -Officer Chiba?

256
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:51,248
Yeah.

257
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,848
This is interesting.

258
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:59,848
What? Suspect of a homicide case?

259
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:01,648
You mean Kato?

260
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,148
Yes, that's right.

261
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:08,148
His colleague at work, Mr. Hirotoshi Nakamoto, was murdered.

262
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,048
The murder weapon was a knife.

263
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,848
It was found on the floor beside the body.

264
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:15,148
And the estimated time of death was?

265
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:18,648
Between 7 am to 7:30 am this morning.

266
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:22,148
Then, he couldn't have committed the crime.

267
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,948
Because he woke me up at 7 am,

268
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,648
and we were here together watching TV until 8 pm.

269
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:29,648
Right?

270
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:30,648
Yeah.

271
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,748
Is it true?

272
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:36,248
Yes. We were watching Nichiuri TV's live morning broadcast

273
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:39,348
"Morning Live Seven", a news variety program.

274
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,848
But, Officer Chiba, he woke you up, didn't he?

275
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,548
Then it could be that he showed you something that

276
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,848
he had video taped some time ago, right?

277
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,848
No way!

278
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,648
I've got proof too.

279
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:53,248
By the way, why am I suspected in the first place?

280
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:55,848
Because you're my ex-boyfriend!

281
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:58,948
There's an eye-witness

282
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:01,448
that says he saw you a little past 7 am near the condominium!

283
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:05,148
Are you sure that guy wasn't half asleep and mistook me for someone else?

284
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,548
We weren't half asleep!

285
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,448
I saw it clearly!

286
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:10,748
It was him!

287
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:13,848
He was wearing a gray parka top.

288
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:16,548
You were running with a black knapsack on your back!

289
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,748
Just as if you were jogging.

290
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,848
Let's have Officer Chiba show us in!

291
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:26,448
And show us proof that he was watching TV with that man

292
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:29,048
from 7 am to 8 am in the morning.

293
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:33,748
Wait... What's this?

294
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,948
What a mess!

295
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,148
I can see why you're always late for work.

296
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,548
I'm doing the best I can!

297
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:44,348
I'm recently not as tardy as I used to be, right?

298
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:46,448
Come to think of it, that's true.

299
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,648
How come?

300
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:50,648
Oh, well, I sort of did something to give me initiative to get up.

301
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,248
What's with these toys here?

302
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,548
Don't tell me that you're some special effects freak or something?

303
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,348
Who cares?

304
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:58,848
I mean after all, it's just a hobby.

305
00:16:02,148 --> 00:16:03,648
It's Gomera! Gomera!

306
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,448
Masked Yaiba is here too!

307
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:10,348
-That's a rare object made of tin! -Hey! Don't get rough with them.

308
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:11,648
I told you all to wait in the car

309
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:15,848
with Mr. Kato and Ms. Shimura, didn't I?

310
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,448
And, where is it?

311
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:21,848
The proof you mentioned that both of you were watching TV together.

312
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,648
Oh, yes, sir! It's this video tape.

313
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:30,948
Hi! This is "Yoko Okino's Four-minute Cooking"!

314
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,348
It's February 25th, Friday.

315
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:37,848
I video tape this corner of "Morning Live Seven" each time.

316
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:41,348
Last night, I watched rental videos with Kato while drinking

317
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:42,548
and fell asleep here.

318
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,248
I forgot to pre-set the program to record it

319
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,048
so I recorded it myself today.

320
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:50,448
That's why he couldn't have shown me something he recorded beforehand.

321
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:53,748
Besides that, there is only one video tape deck is being used.

322
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:56,548
But, there's another deck here.

323
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,948
That's one that we only use sometimes for dubbing!

324
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:01,348
If he used that deck,

325
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:03,448
the cord would show in front of the TV,

326
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:06,148
and I would notice it no matter how drowsy I may be.

327
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:10,048
If you think it's a lie, call the TV station and confirm it!

328
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:16,148
It's the corner after Nichiruri TV's "Morning Live Seven"'s

329
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,848
weather forecast of today, February 25th, Friday.

330
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:22,448
Gosh. You have many marks in other places too.

331
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:24,248
Even the cable TV programs are marked.

332
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:26,648
There are so many programs I want to watch.

333
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:27,948
I see.

334
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:31,948
That's why you've got so many memo pads stuck all over the TV.

335
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:36,948
And? After watching the program until 8 pm, what did you do?

336
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:39,148
I watched videos from 8 pm.

337
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,848
What video?

338
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,248
Oh, well... That's...

339
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,648
Chiba! Hey!

340
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,748
Don't tell me?

341
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,148
X-rated videos?

342
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,648
What? No!

343
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,348
"Masked Yaiba" -It's this video...

344
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:55,448
This.

345
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:08,148
"Masked Yaiba"

346
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:10,148
-It's "Masked Yaiba"! -It's "Masked Yaiba"!

347
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,648
Amazing!

348
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,048
Yaiba kick!

349
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,348
This is first episode of the first Yaiba!

350
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,348
The mask of the first Yaiba was really gross

351
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,548
but that was one of the good points!

352
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:36,848
And how long were you watching this children's program?

353
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,248
I watched one 120 minute tape.

354
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,848
You mean you watched it for two hours?

355
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,648
No, it's taped on triple the regular speed

356
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:45,448
and the commercials aren't cut so...

357
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:47,548
-Six hours? -Six hours?

358
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:52,048
Did you video tape all the tapes, Officer Chiba?

359
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,848
No, Kato gave me the ones he taped before.

360
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,748
And were you with him right through?

361
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:02,848
No, after watching half the program I went to take a shower,

362
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,748
for about 30 minutes.

363
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,848
Then, I started watching again.

364
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,748
I watched all the way to episode 12 and stopped the video.

365
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,948
Then professional baseball was being aired so.

366
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:15,848
You know, the game from 2 pm the Falcons versus the Jaguars!

367
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:17,248
Officer Chosuke and the others came along

368
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:19,648
while I was watching that game.

369
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:21,448
I see.

370
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:23,748
From here to the victim's condominium,

371
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:26,348
it would take at least an hour by car.

372
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,048
If after watching TV for an hour,

373
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,948
they watched the video for approximately six hours together,

374
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,848
his alibi is established.

375
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:36,348
Just to be sure, let's look for the gray parka top

376
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:39,248
and black knapsack the man had on him.

377
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,248
What? Is that for real?

378
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:55,248
What? What is it?

379
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,448
Did you find something?

380
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:58,048
No.

381
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:59,248
Nothing really.

382
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:02,948
Gosh. If there's nothing, don't shout!

383
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,948
-Sorry. -Sorry.

384
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:08,148
And how long is the dispatch to Tottori going to be?

385
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:11,548
The guys at the first division says it'll be about three years.

386
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:14,348
And what did Officer Sato say?

387
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:17,548
She wants me to get her some 20th Century Japanese Pears.

388
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:19,348
Is that it?

389
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,848
That's it.

390
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:22,248
Strange.

391
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,748
It's more natural that she would get more upset.

392
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:26,948
Well...

393
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:30,448
although I'll be dispatched, it seems I get to take off once a month,

394
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:32,048
and I can call her frequently too.

395
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:34,048
I hope you don't end up like Kato.

396
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:35,048
What?

397
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:39,448
He was abroad on a business trip till last month,

398
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,548
but as soon as he got back,

399
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:43,748
he called me and asked me to put him up here.

400
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,248
He said that while he was away, the woman he was living with

401
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:46,948
started going out with another man,

402
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:49,548
so he was left without a place to stay.

403
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,248
And...

404
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,748
He used to call her everyday, and yet,

405
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:56,448
he complained he could never understand women.

406
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:57,948
If you're serious about her,

407
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:00,648
I think you should let her know, don't you?

408
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:04,348
About how you feel and what your plans are for the future.

409
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:08,048
And, you never know what'll happen to you either, right?

410
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:09,048
Me?

411
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,148
Maybe...

412
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:13,048
Maybe end up finding a lover over there!

413
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:15,348
-What? -That's right.

414
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:18,548
If that happens, he won't be coming home for a while.

415
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:19,648
No way.

416
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:23,048
Yes. It is said that the hearts of people proportionately pull apart,

417
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,348
the more time passes.

418
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:28,648
Although there rarely seems to be exceptions at times.

419
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:29,648
Hey.

420
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:32,548
I will never go with a woman other than her!

421
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:34,248
Never!

422
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:35,848
What do you mean?

423
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,848
Just who are we talking about?

424
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,848
Who?

425
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:40,948
What?

426
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:43,348
We were talking about Hide.

427
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,548
Because he may be going abroad.

428
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,548
Oh, Hide.

429
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:50,948
It seems that Hide decided to remain in Japan.

430
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:52,348
-What? -Really?

431
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:54,848
You saw the press conference they had in the afternoon?

432
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:57,848
No, right after "Morning Live Seven" started,

433
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,348
there was a flash news report subtitle displayed on the screen.

434
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:02,748
It said, "Player Akagi Hideo of the Tokyo Spirits

435
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,348
have announced that he will remain!

436
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:07,048
A press conference will be held at 12 noon."

437
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:10,748
Did the newscaster mention anything about that news later?

438
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:13,848
No, not in particular.

439
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,048
Wait a second.

440
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,248
Maybe...

441
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:22,548
I see, so that's the story!

442
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:23,748
But, it's not possible.

443
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:26,148
Even if this trick were to be used, there are still...

444
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,848
There are still some parts I cannot explain.

445
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,648
How was it done?

446
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,548
How was the time rigged?

447
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,675
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,375
"Clock"

449
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,675
-The next episode... -Will be about...

450
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,975
-The two police officers... -Finally...

451
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:40,175
Breaking up.
