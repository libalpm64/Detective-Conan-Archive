1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,590
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,890
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,790
Twice around a unique house in a day.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,090
An unexpected solution to an unexpected trick.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,250
"West Izu"

9
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,150
Well, the Inspector insisted that I ride this,

10
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,950
so I borrowed it from him.

11
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,550
But, boy was I lucky. For real.

12
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,650
I figured something like this happened, pops.

13
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,950
So...

14
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,150
I implore you, Inspector Megure!

15
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,750
Will you please?

16
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,450
I guess not, after all.

17
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,750
Inspector Megure?

18
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,050
Thank you so very much, Inspector Megure!

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,050
I'm pretty sure you forced your way through

20
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,750
borrowing this car.

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,550
And you call this lucky?

22
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,950
It's raining cats and dogs.

23
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,450
I can't even get a view of Mt. Fuji.

24
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,850
Talk about unlucky.

25
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,750
Do you think so?

26
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,750
By the way, how much longer do we have to go, dad?

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,550
It's about time we get there, but...

28
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,350
Oh, isn't that it?

29
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,250
"The Gunshot at Sunflower Manor"

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,050
It took quite a while to get here

31
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,150
after the building came into view, right?

32
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,050
It did. The rain stopped too.

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,450
Mr. Mouri.

34
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,050
Yes!

35
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,350
"Ryuichiro Kanazawa (32)" -We've been waiting for you.

36
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,950
I'm very familiar with all your great deductions

37
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,950
through the articles in the papers.

38
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,950
I've read about you in the papers too,

39
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,050
famous architect, Mr. Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,750
I hear you've received another award just recently too.

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,850
What was it called?

42
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,150
The International Competition

43
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,850
at the Shanghai Modern Art Museum.

44
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,350
Mr. Kanazawa, are they your guests?

45
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,250
They are Hayashida and Amamori.

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,050
"Makoto Hayashida (26)" -I'm Makoto Hayashida.

47
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,450
"Masaya Amamori (25)" -I'm Masaya Amamori.

48
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,150
Keep your cool now,

49
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,550
this person here is none other than Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

50
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,450
-Mr. Kogoro Mouri? -That...

51
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,150
I am the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri.

52
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,550
I wish you'd stop

53
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,750
addressing yourself as a renowned detective.

54
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,750
What?

55
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,250
A stalker?

56
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,550
Yes, pictures like these have been sent to me

57
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,850
since three months ago.

58
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,550
You're in every picture.

59
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,650
Firstly, we have to find out who is doing this.

60
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,550
Do you have any ideas?

61
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,450
Not at all.

62
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,750
Please think carefully.

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,750
What I presume from years of my experience is that

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,150
the stalker is very likely someone you know.

65
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,350
What?

66
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,950
For example...

67
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,150
"7 pm"

68
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,450
Is the award ceremony the day after tomorrow?

69
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,950
It's going to be at a hotel in Shanghai.

70
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,850
Shanghai? Are you all going too?

71
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,350
No, we're going to stay behind and watch the house.

72
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,050
Right, Amamori?

73
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,550
Yeah, I guess.

74
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,250
By the way, Ran, what do you think of this building?

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,950
It sure is a different looking building.

76
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,750
You think so too, don't you?

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,950
Mr. Kanazawa designed this building personally too,

78
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,750
but it's a good taste, don't you think?

79
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,050
I had a feeling the building moved just now?

80
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,750
It's really moving.

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,950
The second floor moves once around every 12 hours.

82
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,250
We call it the Sunflower Manor.

83
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,350
How interesting.

84
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,350
But, why was it made to rotate?

85
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,950
Beats me. I wonder why.

86
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,150
I guess I'll ask Mr. Kanazawa one of these days.

87
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,050
There's no reason.

88
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,150
"Mitsuko Kanazawa (38)" -His architecture is nothing more than

89
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,150
crowd pleasing bluff!

90
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,750
"7:10 pm"

91
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,250
By the time you return,

92
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,850
I'm sure everything will be solved.

93
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,450
I sure hope so.

94
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,550
Mr. Mouri, was it?

95
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,450
Oh. Yes!

96
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,750
Mr. Mouri!

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,950
Could I also ask you a favor?

98
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,750
Yes.

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,950
Would you...

100
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,650
Would you please investigate his background?

101
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,850
If the remuneration is greatly split,

102
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,150
I may have half the compensation.

103
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,550
Mitsuko, that's enough!

104
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,650
Wasted and boozed out like that,

105
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,750
can you get on the plane tomorrow or what!

106
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,250
Why don't you go to the awards ceremony alone?

107
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,350
Or, do you intend to go with the stalker?

108
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,250
Now, that's enough!

109
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,450
You're the one that's already done enough.

110
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,050
You seem to be concerned over a stalker or what not,

111
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,850
but aren't you the one who brought it upon yourself?

112
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,150
Like your ex-girlfriends and such.

113
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,250
Hayashida!

114
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,650
Yes, sir?

115
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,950
All you've been eating so far is meat.

116
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,150
Yes. But this meat...

117
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,850
Meat... With those unbalanced eating habit,

118
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,050
you can never come up with designs

119
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,250
with a taste of originality to them.

120
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,950
"7:20 pm" -It's all because of your unbalanced diet.

121
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,450
Just where do you think you're going?

122
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,450
I'm just going to get some beer from the refrigerator!

123
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,150
Why don't you stop picking on people weaker than you?

124
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,150
If you keep it up,

125
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,750
you'll be bitten by your supposedly faithful dog one day.

126
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,550
Right, Mr. Amamori?

127
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,650
"7:25pm" -I'll go get some charcoal.

128
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,850
Will you watch the meat

129
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,950
so that it won't get over cooked?

130
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,550
What? Okay.

131
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,150
Mr. Mouri! This dressing goes well with that salad.

132
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,350
But it says olive oil on it.

133
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,950
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,650
I used what bottle I had available,

135
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,050
but the dressing is what I just made a while ago.

136
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,950
It's my own original dressing.

137
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,450
You don't have to use any of the dressing.

138
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,950
Besides, her taste buds are not what you can call normal.

139
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,850
My. That's just what you think.

140
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,550
Mr. Kanazawa!

141
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,450
It's 7:29 pm. 1 minute left.

142
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,850
Oh, that's right.

143
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,150
Then, will you take care of things for me here?

144
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,350
Mr. Amamori, where is Mr. Kanazawa going?

145
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,150
To watch the Chinese Language Course on TV.

146
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,150
He's all excited about giving his speech in Chinese

147
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,750
at the awards ceremony.

148
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,050
No matter how busy he is recently,

149
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,250
he checks the program out real time.

150
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,650
It's just a snobbish hobby.

151
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,550
"7:35 pm"

152
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,350
Now...

153
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,050
Where's my beer?

154
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,250
Have a cold one.

155
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,750
Thank you.

156
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,250
Come on, dad!

157
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,350
Haven't you already had enough?

158
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,050
Don't be silly! I just started drinking!

159
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,150
What was that?

160
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,750
Mr. Kanazawa!

161
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,350
The doors locked from the inside!

162
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,950
Is there a spare key?

163
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,150
Most likely not.

164
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,550
I guess we have no choice but to break the door down, then.

165
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,950
I'll go get an axe!

166
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,550
"7:40 pm"

167
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,150
Mr. Kanazawa?

168
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,850
Mr. Kanazawa!

169
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,550
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Kanazawa?

170
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,950
Is something wrong?

171
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,450
Ran, turn on the lights!

172
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,650
All right!

173
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,750
Mr. Kanazawa?

174
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,150
Mr. Kanazawa!

175
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,260
The victim is architect, Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

176
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,160
It seems that Mr. Kanazawa

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
always sits here whenever he watches TV.

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,660
"Officer Yokomizo" -He died on the spot

179
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,960
after being shot in the head.

180
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,960
And the murder weapon seems to be nowhere in this room.

181
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,660
The windows are all locked from the inside.

182
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,460
So it's a locked room murder case!

183
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,660
No.

184
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,760
There is a mark of a bullet having pierced through the window here.

185
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,860
Which means the sniper shot the gun from...

186
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,160
Shot the gun from?

187
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,460
Shot the gun from...

188
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,760
I wonder where?

189
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,460
Mr. Mouri!

190
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,060
This is no time to be joking!

191
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,160
Excuse me! This room is really something, you know?

192
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,960
I was told that it rotates once around every 12 hours!

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,660
Rotates?

194
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,360
I see! It's 8:35 pm now,

195
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,160
so the gunshot was heard an hour ago.

196
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,760
If we move back the line that ties the position of the victim

197
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,060
and the hole on the window an hour, in other words,

198
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,060
move back at an angle of 30 degrees.

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,060
That's it!

200
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,860
I wonder what that is?

201
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,360
That thing that is on the decoration of that building.

202
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,260
Could it be oil?

203
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,060
There are none, after all.

204
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,560
What's up?

205
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,960
Well, there are no footprints around the pine

206
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,260
where the rifle was fixed on.

207
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,060
There were quite a few

208
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,760
between the shed and the party hall, though.

209
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,460
Between 6:00 to 6:30 this evening,

210
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,160
it was raining cats and dogs in this area.

211
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,060
Which means that nobody went near the tree

212
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,060
where the gun was fixed after 6:30!

213
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,360
If so, just how did the sniper fire?

214
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,160
At any rate, go find the owner of the rifle on the double!

215
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,760
Yes, sir!

216
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,860
Mr. Mouri!

217
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,660
The rifle is wet.

218
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,860
So, it must've been placed there

219
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,360
before the sudden shower, after all.

220
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,160
It's right on target.

221
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,260
This is undoubtedly the weapon.

222
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,660
The problem is after the gun was fired,

223
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,760
where did the sniper go?

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Don't tell me the sniper took a dive into the sea.

225
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,960
But, the beach is right below,

226
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,060
so it'd be impossible to jump right into the sea.

227
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,060
Mr. Mouri!

228
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,660
This is a fishing line!

229
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,860
-The end of the fishing line... -The end of the fishing line...

230
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
What's with this line?

231
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,160
It's covered with mud.

232
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,660
There's mud on the trigger too!

233
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,960
What?

234
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,160
A weight?

235
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I see! I got it.

236
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,560
What?

237
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,660
The fact is this...

238
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,760
This sniper knew that the victim

239
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,460
would be watching TV in the study,

240
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,960
calculated the time when the bullet would strike its target,

241
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,160
and then at the time of the crime,

242
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
pulled the weight at the tip of the fish line from here.

243
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,260
Then the sniper would not have to go into the villa,

244
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
and fleeing would not be difficult.

245
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,960
Then, you think that the sniper is someone from outside?

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,360
But, if the sniper knew what the victim was going to do.

247
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,660
Officer Yokomizo.

248
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,560
The victim was being hassled by a heinous stalker lately.

249
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,960
Which means that the stalker is the sniper?

250
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,060
I guess it would be most reasonable to come to that conclusion.

251
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,660
It's true that unlike the usual Pops,

252
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,460
his deductions have been correct so far.

253
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,460
It was impossible for people at the party to shoot

254
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,060
when the shot was heard.

255
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,260
But, why is this so intricately designed?

256
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,160
Hold on. That is why

257
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,960
there was mud on both the fishing line and the rifle.

258
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,760
The sudden shower would've washed the mud clean.

259
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,660
What on earth is going on?

260
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,160
Was it rigged to hide something else?

261
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,560
If so, what could it be?

262
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,960
Officer Yokomizo!

263
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,260
The rifle seems to be the victim's personal belongings.

264
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,660
He had filed a robbery report for the rifle last week.

265
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
I see.

266
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,860
And the substance that was on the decoration

267
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,460
of the second floor outer wall

268
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,260
was oil after all.

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,660
Oil?

270
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
Okay. I would like you all to tell me

271
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,660
what you were doing today!

272
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
At 6:40 pm,

273
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,860
Right after arriving here, Mr. Mouri immediately went up

274
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,660
to the second floor together with Mr. Kanazawa.

275
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,460
Conan, Ran, Mr. Hayashida and Mr. Amamori

276
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,360
were all in the backyard, right?

277
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,760
And, Mrs. Kanazawa, you were...

278
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,460
I was drinking brandy in the kitchen.

279
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,160
I went outside after 7:00 pm.

280
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,660
The party began at 7:10 pm

281
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,360
and Mr. Mouri and Mr. Kanazawa join in.

282
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,960
At 7:20 pm, Mr. Hayashida,

283
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,060
you went to the kitchen to get some beer.

284
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,660
You were gone for about five minutes.

285
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,960
Mr. Amamori, you left to go get some charcoal

287
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,160
just as Mr. Hayashida was coming back from the kitchen.

288
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,060
He was gone for four minutes.

289
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,760
At 7:29 pm,

290
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,060
Mr. Kanazawa goes upstairs alone

291
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,860
in order to watch TV.

292
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,560
After that, I left to go to the bathroom at 7:30 pm

293
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,460
and was gone for about five minutes.

294
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,860
I heard the gunshot as soon as I got back.

295
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,160
Let me verify things once more.

296
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,760
At the time the gunshot was heard,

297
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,460
everyone that was at the party was here?

298
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,360
Yeah, that is why none of us here

299
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,160
could've shot the gun.

300
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,060
I've more or less figured out the trick.

301
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,160
But, the problem is who did it.

302
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,460
This is...

303
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,660
Hey, officer. There's something on the ground.

304
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,260
Thank you!

305
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,660
Mr. Mouri says he wants you to check on something.

306
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,060
The diameter of the building is 20m,

307
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,560
the distance from the building to the tree

308
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,360
where the rifle was set up is 10m.

309
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,460
And the length of the fishing line that is left on the rifle

310
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,560
is precisely 10m and 2cm.

311
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,860
Thank you!

312
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,960
I've figured it out!

313
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,060
That person is the sniper!

314
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,860
Conan!

315
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,660
That kid, where is he hiding anyway?

316
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,960
Hey. Dad!

317
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,460
This is no time to rest. Help me look for Conan!

318
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,960
I've found him!

319
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,060
What?

320
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm over here

321
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,460
Conan!

322
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,460
And I've also figured out who did it.

323
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,460
Ran, will you please gather everyone here?

324
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,360
Mr. Mouri! You've figured out who did it?

325
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,660
I thought you said just now that the sniper was someone from outside.

326
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,460
Please forget what I said back then.

327
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,360
But, its true that the trigger could be pulled

328
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,060
if the fishing line is pulled from below the cliff.

329
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,360
Because the sniper probably wanted to confuse everyone

330
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,560
by making it look like someone from the outside committed the crime.

331
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,160
But, the sniper didn't realize that

332
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,260
mud would adhere to the trigger.

333
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,460
If it rained, the mud was supposed to wash off clean.

334
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,860
In other words, the rifle was fired in another way.

335
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,110
And the one who was capable of carrying it out.

336
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,310
In other words, the sniper is here.

337
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,910
What?

338
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,310
I shall show you right now how the rifle was fired

339
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,310
without anyone attending to it.

340
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,510
May I ask you to help me, Officer Yokomizo?

341
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,810
Yes, sir.

342
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,410
Please roll the paper up tight.

343
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,910
Then connect the cylinders with double-stick tape

344
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,010
and make a rod.

345
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,210
Then stick the double-stick tape on the tip of the rod.

346
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,410
What is this double-stick for?

347
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,710
That reminds me, I found this on the ground!

348
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,710
It's the same!

349
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,610
You mean this is the sniper's?

350
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,710
When everything is ready,

351
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,610
will you please look at the ground?

352
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,610
This was found by the trigger.

353
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,910
Please hook that onto the tip of the rod.

354
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,610
Then lift the rod towards the building.

355
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,510
Lift up the fishing line that is attached to the pine tree.

356
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,110
And when the line is pulled taut,

357
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,310
the weight that is attached to the other end of the line.

358
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,310
I see, that's why there was mud on the fishing line.

359
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,510
Now, please look at the top of the building.

360
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,110
Do you see something?

361
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,610
The top?

362
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,710
Did you say the top?

363
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,110
The decoration on the second floor?

364
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,210
Yes. The sniper hooked the fishing line on it.

365
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,210
The weight is gradually pulled up.

366
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,510
And eventually puts pressure on the trigger.

367
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,210
Of course, the sniper was extremely careful

368
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,810
and applied oil to the decoration

369
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,110
so that the fishing line would slide smoothly.

370
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,710
The sniper probably placed tissue paper

371
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,310
or something that was soaked in oil

372
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,610
at the tip of the newspaper.

373
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,810
The oil was most likely applied

374
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,610
just before the fishing line was hooked up.

375
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,910
It probably took at most one to two minutes.

376
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,810
And, Mr. Mouri! Just who is it?

377
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,110
The sniper.

378
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,110
The sniper is...

379
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,510
You, Mr. Amamori!

380
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,510
At 7:25 pm,

381
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,710
you went out to the backyard saying that

382
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,110
you were going to get some charcoal.

383
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,410
You pulled up the fishing line that you had hidden

384
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,810
under the soil beforehand,

385
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,810
and got it ready.

386
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,710
Then, you came back to the party site

387
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,910
as if nothing had happened.

388
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,810
With the rod made of newspaper taken apart

389
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,710
and you used it to wrapped the charcoal in it.

390
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,910
Because of the length of the fishing line,

391
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,710
the time the fishing line could be hooked

392
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,010
onto the building was only 10 minutes.

393
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,710
In other words, we heard the gunshot at 7:35pm.

394
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,810
Which means the culprit left the party

395
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,410
during the 10 minutes time frame from 7:25pm.

396
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,010
And you're the only one I can think of.

397
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,010
All of you do not know the real...

398
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,210
the real Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

399
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,410
I'm the one who designed

400
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,910
the Shanghai Modern Museum!

401
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,410
I stole your design?

402
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,310
Don't be ridiculous. Do you have proof?

403
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,110
I've always respected you, Mr. Kanazawa!

404
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,210
I'll just warn you about one thing.

405
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,210
You don't seem to be aware of where you stand.

406
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,610
That design gained public attention

407
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,210
because it was announced under my name.

408
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,360
If you want to stay here, watch your mouth.

409
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,360
At that time, I swore to myself that...

410
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,760
I would never let him go to the awards ceremony.

411
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,960
Then, were you the one that was stalking him?

412
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,260
Yes. I made up an imaginary stalker.

413
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,660
Everything went as planned. Mr. Mouri.

414
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,160
Other than the fact that you showed up today.

415
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,210
What's up, Ran?

416
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,610
After this case,

417
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,610
I don't know if I can trust

418
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,010
those who people call geniuses anymore.

419
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,810
Which means you can't trust me either?

420
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,010
-What? -What?

421
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,810
Imagine that the great Mouri Kogoro

422
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,910
is not the one solving all these cases.

423
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,210
What do you think of that idea?

424
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,310
You know yourself more than you realize!

425
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,320
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,420
"Scratched up cell phone"

427
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
The stage of the next episode is at the beach.

428
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,880
Conan, how do you like my swimsuit?

429
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:42,220
My nose is bleeding.
