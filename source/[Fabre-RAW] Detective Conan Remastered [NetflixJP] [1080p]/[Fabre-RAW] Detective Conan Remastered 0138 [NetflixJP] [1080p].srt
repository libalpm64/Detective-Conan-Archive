1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,780
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,780
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,480
Today's stage is a theatre.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,780
A crime show from projector!

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,480
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,980
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,290
"Last Show for Murder (Part 1)"

9
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,890
What? A discount movie ticket?
"Last Show for Murder (Part 1)"

10
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,790
What? A discount movie ticket?

11
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,790
Yes, Ai got it from Dr. Agasa

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,490
and told her to go watch the movies with us.

13
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,990
You can go to any movie playing at theatre arcade.

14
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,990
It's great, isn't it? Let's go together!

15
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,090
Okay! Next Wednesday, on School Foundation Day,

16
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,290
it's going to be the Movies Day for the Youth Detective Squad!

17
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,490
I think what you want to say is Movie Viewing Day.

18
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,190
You're coming too, aren't you, Conan?

19
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,690
Well, I have other plans...

20
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,390
Are you saying you're not coming, Conan?

21
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,490
Ai went out of her way to give the ticket to us.

22
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,490
He got it as a prize from a raffle ticket.

23
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,290
Is that so?

24
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,390
Anyway, let's go together to deepen the bond

25
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,290
among the members of the Youth Detective Squad!

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,390
That's right, we've got to deepen the "band"!

27
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,390
Just how do you deepen a "band"?

28
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,590
All right... I'll go.

29
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,590
I will come along...

30
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,490
Even the renown detective doesn't stand a chance.

31
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,890
Leave me alone!

32
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,490
"Gomera"...

33
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,490
We'll watch "Gomera"...

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,590
Hey... we're members of the Youth Detective Squad, right?

35
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,590
Wouldn't something like "The Onimaru Legend Murder Case" be better?

36
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,290
That's the one that you have to use your head a lot, isn't it?

37
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,790
Let's see a movie that we can watch more for entertainment today!

38
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,590
Ai, what do you want to watch?

39
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,390
Well, how about something like what's playing at the Geibunza,

40
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,190
"Einstein's Days of Glory and Pain"?

41
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,890
Einstein?

42
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,690
What is that? Can you eat it?

43
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,290
Sounds like it's going to give me a stiff shoulder?

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,190
All right, then we go for our own choice.

45
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,890
It should be no problem.

46
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,990
What? No!

47
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,490
Ai said that Dr. Agasa told us to watch the movie together.

48
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,490
What should we do, Mitsuhiko?

49
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,390
We only have one choice at times like this!

50
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,390
Yes, that's the only way!

51
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,490
Rock, paper, scissors...

52
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,390
What a thing to have happened?

53
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,690
Just because I publicized that research lab...

54
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,890
If we leave things as they are,

55
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,690
innocent people will be killed one after the other by him.

56
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,690
Do we have no other choice

57
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,190
than to rely 011, that legend to save mankind?

58
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,690
The legend of...

59
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,490
the great monster, Gomera!

60
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,490
Okay, go for it, Gomera!

61
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,490
Don't let man-eating spider beat you!

62
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,790
Hang in there, Gomera.

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,890
His head! His head is his weak point!

64
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,490
Gosh. Well, the chances of us watching "Gomera" was 3 out of 5,

65
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,890
I can only admit my fate.

66
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,790
I think this movie is pretty well made.

67
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,190
The futile end of mankind who has become infatuated in science.

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,490
It just sends shivers up your spine, doesn't it?

69
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,090
Hey, be quiet, you guys.

70
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,990
I wish you wouldn't raise your hands

71
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,490
or stand up during the movie.

72
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,190
"Toshiyuki Ide, college student" -I can't concentrate on the movie

73
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,190
and besides, you're being a nuisance to the other viewers.

74
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,590
I'm sorry. -We are sorry.

75
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,090
Who does he think he is, anyway?

76
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,090
You idiot, it's your fault for not watching the movie quietly.

77
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,390
By the way, there's only a few people here.

78
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,690
There are only four other people besides us.

79
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,990
We don't have school today because it's Foundation Day,

80
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,890
and it's a weekday today.

81
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,390
Besides, they only play revivals here.

82
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,790
My dad was saying don't come here

83
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,090
because there are a lot of fights here.

84
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,990
Oh, my mom was saying so too!

85
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,390
Is this theatre messy?

86
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,390
There are ladders placed here and there too.

87
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,290
There are ropes and wires on the floor.

88
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,090
I wonder if they're going to renovate this place.

89
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,890
"The End"

90
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,590
The movie was funny!

91
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,090
You're right!

92
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,290
Gomera sure was gallant.

93
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,690
Yes! It had a scary face and was a bit small,

94
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,190
but was super fantastic!

95
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,990
This Gomera was created way before we were born,

96
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,090
it will be growing too!

97
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,390
How did you like it, Conan?

98
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,390
What? Well, it was so-so, I guess.

99
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,390
I saw this movie until I got sick of it when I was a kid.

100
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,190
Let's hurry home and play soccer or something!

101
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,590
What're you talking about, Conan?

102
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,690
There are still two more shows left.

103
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,390
What?

104
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,590
"The great monster, Gomera" -Three movies playing?

105
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,090
"Gomera's counterattack" -And they're all movies

106
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,590
"Gomera versus Mechanical Gomera" -that I've already seen.

107
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,890
It's a fantastic line up of three movies, totaling five hours.

108
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,890
That's a lot, isn't it?

109
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,190
Hey... is this for real?

110
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,990
Aren't you guys hungry?

111
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,890
They were selling popcorn at the stand!

112
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,890
Let's go and see. -Okay!

113
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,890
I'm sure glad we came, aren't you? -Yes.

114
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,290
Come along too, Ai.

115
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,390
Okay.

116
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,290
Come on, Conan. -Okay.

117
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,590
Wait up!

118
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,490
Two more to go.

119
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,590
Well, it's good too.

120
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,890
We should rest our brain cells at times

121
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,790
and enjoy a short break.

122
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,290
I came today hoping to do so too.

123
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,090
A break?

124
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,990
Besides, if you use your head too much,

125
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,590
you're going to go bald like Dr. Agasa.

126
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,490
What?

127
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,390
Here you go! 3 cups of cokes and 2 cups of coffee.

128
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,490
And 5 boxes of popcorn.

129
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,090
What? We only want 3 boxes of popcorn.

130
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,190
It's okay... The 2 boxes are on me!

131
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,590
"Yuriko Yuri (23), shop assistant" -You come here quite often

132
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,090
and besides, you're our last customers.

133
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,590
Last? -That's right.

134
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,290
We're closing down the theatre today.

135
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,590
This theatre that...

136
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,890
"Akio Muramatsu (62), the theatre's owner" -we kept going for 30 years.

137
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,890
I see, that's why there were ropes and other stuff on the floor.

138
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,590
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,790
The construction workers were working here till a while ago.

140
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,590
Gosh, they could have started tomorrow.

141
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,090
Well, don't say that.

142
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,090
I am kind to keep you open until today

143
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,090
despite wanting to bust this place up right away.

144
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,090
It's because the owner of this theatre

145
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,790
asking me to wait until the Opening Commemoration Day.

146
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,790
Mr. Hatta.

147
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,190
"Seiji Hatta (43)" -Well, I have been waiting

148
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,590
"president of real estate company" -to the last day of this theatre,

149
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,690
but there are only few customers.

150
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,390
If only Gomera would stomp this place to pieces,

151
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,890
I could save myself some pennies dismantling fees.

152
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,390
Hey, you!

153
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,290
"Minoru Furuhashi (39)" -It's no smoking in the theatre!

154
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,290
"Projectionist" -Don't make me keep repeating myself, you idiot!

155
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,290
I'm sorry...

156
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,190
I'll be careful from tomorrow.

157
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,490
Oh, no! This place will be destroyed tomorrow.

158
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,890
That guy...

159
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,390
Excuse me.

160
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,790
"Keep repeating yourself"? You mean he comes here often?

161
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,390
Yes, he has been here every day lately.

162
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,890
And every time he shows up,

163
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,690
those punks start fighting in here while the movie is showing.

164
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,090
The punks were probably hired by him anyway!

165
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,490
He made them make a fuss in here so that a bad reputation would go around

166
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,390
and led us into bankruptcy!

167
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,390
Hey... you shouldn't say such things!

168
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,490
But...

169
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,090
What? He is the man.

170
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,190
Oh, Mr. Ide is here again today?

171
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,590
Yes, he says since today is the final day,

172
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,890
he would like to take a picture of the inside of the theatre.

173
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,090
It's all right, isn't it?

174
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,090
Yes, no problem.

175
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,090
He likes special effects movies

176
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,390
and he has been coming here since his childhood days.

177
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,790
He is just like a son to me.

178
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,690
Well, shall we start eating lunch soon?

179
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,190
Oh, I forgot to buy box lunch!

180
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,190
Then I will go and get the lunches.

181
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,990
No! You'll have to stay here all day today

182
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,790
until the last show today.

183
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,190
Then why don't you go when the next show begins playing, Yuri?

184
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,590
I don't think we'll have many customers anyway today.

185
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,990
And even if we do, we can somehow handle it

186
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,490
with the help of the lady at the ticket booth!

187
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,190
I guess I'll do that.

188
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,690
Oh, no! It's almost time to start.

189
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,790
We ran out of tea leaves. Can you get some too?

190
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,790
Okay, but you'll have to pay for it!

191
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,790
Sure.

192
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,490
So they're closing this place down.

193
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,490
Yes, they used to play so many good movies.

194
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,190
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

195
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,190
"Gomera's counterattack"

196
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,490
The enemy monster is going to lay an egg inside Gomera

197
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,690
towards the middle of the movie!

198
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,490
How gross!

199
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,190
What's with you?

200
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,790
Me?

201
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,990
I'm Gomera!

202
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,190
Let's get out of here already.

203
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,490
It seems to be true that he was hiring those punks.

204
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,390
I feel sorry for the owner.

205
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,390
Well, I guess I'll resign myself to watching my fill of "Gomera".

206
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,990
Hey, Mitsuhiko, don't tell me you're scared?

207
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,490
No! Don't you think it becomes cold from a while ago?

208
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,690
Come to think of it...

209
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,290
Well, kids just can't take watching movies for such long hours.

210
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,490
Hey, Ai.

211
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,690
Ayumi fell asleep, but I want to go to the restroom,

212
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,490
so will you change seats with me...

213
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,190
Hey... Don't tell me I'm going to stay this way

214
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,090
until the movie ends?

215
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,090
I want to go to the restroom.

216
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,790
Gomera.

217
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,490
Please, Gomera.

218
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,990
Calm down. -Emera is cute after all, isn't she?

219
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,490
Gomera!

220
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,490
Mr. Furuhashi, your tea is ready!

221
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,190
Oh, thanks!

222
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,490
I'll leave it here, then.

223
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,290
Please, Gomera. -What is that?

224
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,490
Please stay still. -What's wrong?

225
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,690
A black shadow is swaying.

226
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,690
Something is hanging in front of the projection window!

227
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,490
Will you go check things out, Yuri?

228
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,690
Okay.

229
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,790
What's wrong?

230
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,790
What on earth happened?

231
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,690
That is...

232
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,890
It seems you have no time to taking a break.

233
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,380
The deceased is Seiji Hatta,

234
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,080
43 years old,

235
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,680
he is the president of a real estate company nearby.

236
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,680
He bought this theatre that is to be closed down today.

237
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,580
Did Mr. Hatta come here often?

238
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Yes, he came almost every day recently.

239
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,880
But it didn't look like he was coming here for the movies.

240
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,480
I think he was more concerned about the progress of dismantling.

241
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,580
He just came to give us a bad time!

242
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,980
Although I'm not sure of his reason.

243
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,380
He was getting in the way of business!

244
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,680
Although we cautioned him many times not to smoke in the theatre,

245
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,580
but he would ignore it, as well as tease the customers.

246
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,980
To top it off, he always sits in last seat

247
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,680
right in front of the projection window!

248
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,280
Thanks to him, a shadow was made on the picture by his cigarette smoke.

249
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,580
What a nuisance!

250
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,480
He must have been smoking today too

251
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,480
because shadows were seen in the picture.

252
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,780
Is it true that he hung himself while the movie was playing?

253
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,980
Yes, I'm sure.

254
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,880
He hung himself right in front of the projection window.

255
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,280
The shadow of his head and the rope showed up on the screen!

256
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,580
Do you remember what time it was?

257
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,380
It was...

258
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,980
It was during the scene when Emera came on!

259
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,680
The scene when Emera was trying to calm Gomera down!

260
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,680
A big shadow came swaying in on the close up of Emera!

261
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,780
Oh, it's you kids again.

262
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,080
That scene is just before the middle

263
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
so the time was about...

264
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,780
12:44 pm.

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,180
If the movie started on time,

266
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,380
I believe there's no mistake as to the time.

267
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,080
What makes you so sure?

268
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Mr. Ide is a special effects mania.

269
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Inspector Megure!

270
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,380
Officer Chiba, have you got something?

271
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,780
According to the lady at the ticket booth,

272
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,580
aside from the children, there were only those four here

273
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,380
at the estimated time of his death.

274
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,280
Is her testimony reliable?

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,380
Yes.

276
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,280
That lady have been talking to someone at the entrance

277
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
since the movie started.

278
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,680
I see.

279
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,580
In other words, if this is murder,

280
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,080
the ones capable of committing the murder

281
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,280
are the four of you here!

282
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,580
What...

283
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,080
Hey... Inspector. This is suicide, isn't it?

284
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,880
Suspending an adult man from a rope

285
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,980
is something impossible for an elderly, a girl, or a skinny man to do.

286
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,380
Well, if anybody, I would be the one capable of doing it,

287
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,280
but I was in the projection room at that time.

288
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Right, Yuri?

289
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,480
Yes.

290
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,580
Just about that time,

291
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,180
I took Mr. Furuhashi who was in the projection room, his lunch and tea,

292
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,780
so there's no mistake.

293
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,780
Where were you two at that time?

294
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,780
I was watching the movie in the theatre.

295
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,380
If you cooperated with each other,

296
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,780
you could've hung him, couldn't you?

297
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,680
What?

298
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,080
That is impossible.

299
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,680
Because I have an alibi.

300
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,080
A digital camera?

301
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,880
Don't tell me...

302
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
these are pictures you took when the incident happened?

303
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,180
Yes, I just happened to be taking pictures

304
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,780
of the memorable scenes that I saw here when I was a child.

305
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,180
Other viewers are also included in it.

306
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,380
But you can take the pictures right after he was hung.

307
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,080
Then, please look at the picture before that one.

308
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,980
I've taken consecutive pictures from the same angle,

309
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,480
so that proves that I was taking pictures all time, doesn't it?

310
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,780
This is a digital camera!

311
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,280
You could easily add a shadow onto a picture that you took beforehand.

312
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,380
I don't think so!

313
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,280
May I have it for a minute?

314
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,980
Well, see over here!

315
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,380
The owner of the theatre and Mitsuhiko are here in this picture!

316
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,880
This is when Mitsuhiko came back from the restroom.

317
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,280
Moreover, the 5 or 6 pictures after the shadow is taken...

318
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,380
See?

319
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,380
I'm sitting in the seat, right?

320
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,480
He had no way of knowing that we were going to be here,

321
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,680
so he couldn't have faked these pictures, right?

322
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,080
That's true.

323
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Why did you leave in the middle of the show?

324
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,780
You seem to be heading for the door opposite the restroom.

325
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,880
I went to check on the air conditioner.

326
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,680
Air conditioner? -Yes.

327
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Because it seemed to be colder than usual.

328
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,480
I thought it was cold too.

329
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,980
That's why I had to go to the restroom.

330
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,780
Where is the device to adjust the air conditioner?

331
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,680
Over that side.

332
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,080
Facing the screen, it's on the other side of the door to the right.

333
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,680
See? It's that room at the end of the corridor.

334
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,280
It's my job to adjust the air conditioner.

335
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,980
It was set stronger than usual.

336
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,780
This is no time to be talking about air conditioners, isn't it?

337
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,080
Isn't the problem whether this is a suicide or homicide?

338
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,980
Could you take me to the projector room

339
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,680
that you say you were in at the time of the incident?

340
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Yes, sure.

341
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
"Do Not Enter"

342
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
This is the stairs that leads to the projection room.

343
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Only authorized personnel is let up here.

344
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,880
What? Where is the projector?

345
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
This is the waiting room. The projector is over on this side.

346
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,080
I see, there are two projectors here.

347
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
Yes, when one of the projectors is showing the movie,

348
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,980
the other one winds the films that have finished rolling.

349
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,480
Can't you do it with one machine?

350
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,780
It takes time to wind the film,

351
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,980
and we won't be able to make it in time for the next show.

352
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,780
And the window on the right here

353
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,680
is used to check whether the film is rolling right.

354
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
The one on the left

355
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,880
is where the projector projects the movie from.

356
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,480
The man hung himself in front of this window

357
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,680
and his shadow showed up on the screen.

358
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,080
This window doesn't open, does it?

359
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,780
Yes, it is tightly sealed with glass.

360
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,380
I was here when the shadow showed up

361
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,780
and Yuri was in the next room serving tea.

362
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,380
There couldn't be a better alibi, right?

363
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,580
I see, so maybe this is suicide after all...

364
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,980
I've come across a good idea!

365
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
A good idea?

366
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes.

367
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
At the scene where Emera comes out

368
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,380
divide the film into the first and second part,

369
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,980
play the first part with the other projector,

370
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,480
then switch over to this projector at the second part.

371
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,980
I see. The first part will be played

372
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,680
without being obstructed by the corpse,

373
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,380
and the shadow will appear the moment the film

374
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,680
is switched to the second part!

375
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,980
Which means it is possible to hang the corpse beforehand!

376
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,080
Interesting, isn't it?

377
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,780
It sure is an interesting idea, kid.

378
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,380
Some theatres actually do that,

379
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,180
but the mark of the part where the film was connected later

380
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,380
will remains on the film.

381
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,980
Inspector, check this film out if you like!

382
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,780
But there is nothing like that by that scene.

383
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Besides, when I went to buy the lunches,

384
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,680
I looked inside this room,

385
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,980
but all I saw moving was this projector.

386
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,080
Is that so?

387
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
What time did you come back with the lunches?

388
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,180
Well, just about 5 minutes

389
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,680
before everybody started making a fuss because of the shadow.

390
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,380
It's about 12:40 pm.

391
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,780
I went to buy the lunches

392
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,080
thinking of eating with everyone during the next break time.

393
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,480
But the convenience store was crowded,

394
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,780
so I asked the lady at the ticket booth

395
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,480
what time it was when I was back.

396
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,980
You can go ask her.

397
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,380
I'm pretty sure.

398
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,080
Which means after you went to bought the lunches,

399
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,980
you were in this room until everybody started making a fuss?

400
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,780
She was boiling the water because I asked her to make me tea.

401
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I see.

402
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,080
Yes, at that portable cooking table.

403
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,580
This room sure is messy.

404
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,980
You could at least replace the broken mirror.

405
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,780
That's true. It's so dusty and the ashtray is full of cigarette butts.

406
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
Did you clean this place at all?

407
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,980
Shut up. How can you feel like cleaning up

408
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
when you know you've got to close down today?

409
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,580
Please let me take the film to the police station for a while.

410
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
Yes, do as you wish.

411
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,980
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

412
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,080
I... I saw it.

413
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,380
What...

414
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,680
What did you see, Mitsuhiko?

415
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,180
Well...

416
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,880
she was in front of the mirror of the ladies room,

417
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,080
holding her eyes down as if she was crying!
