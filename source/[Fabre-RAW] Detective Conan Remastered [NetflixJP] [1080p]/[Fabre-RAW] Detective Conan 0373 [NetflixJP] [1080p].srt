1
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,289
Today's case is about poisonous spiders!

2
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,089
Vertical strings and horizontal strings. The locked room trick.

3
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,889
Open a hole in the tangled mystery!

4
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:29,389
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:31,189
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,089
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Come on, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi!

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,720
Hurry up!

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,220
Let's play soccer.

10
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,820
Let's do so after we go to the library.

11
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,420
New books have come in yesterday.

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,220
Shoots, I came because you said we were going to play soccer.

13
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,720
Hey, say something, Conan.

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,920
I kind of feel like reading too.

15
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,320
What? You're the one who said you wanted to play soccer.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
You traitor!

17
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,420
Really, talk about childish.

18
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,720
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,720
You're going, aren't you, detective?

20
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,420
"Deadly Venom Spider Trap"

21
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
Why don't you try calling the professor?

22
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,620
My hands are full right now.

23
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Why don't you call?

24
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,220
I will then.

25
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,920
Oh, it's okay, I'll call.

26
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,220
It's the signal of lunch break for a nearby factory.

27
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,020
He's not answering.

28
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,820
Will you call him later?

29
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,220
Okay.

30
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,720
A red-back spider.

31
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,320
-What? -Look out!

32
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,020
Genta, don't push me.

33
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,220
We're not going to...

34
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,120
Just what are you doing?

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,020
It's because you guys left on your own.

36
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,620
It's no fair.

37
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,920
Ayumi too?

38
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,620
Hey! Just what are you guys doing?

39
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,720
What? Mitsuhiko?

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,820
What?

41
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,220
Do you know him?

42
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,820
Yes, he's Mr. Itogawa who lives next door to me.

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,720
"Tooru Itogawa (32)" -He's a professor who's researching spiders

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,420
at the university.

45
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,420
That's a red-back spider, isn't it?

46
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
"Yoshiki Urazaki (38)" -Yeah, that's right.

47
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,520
It's amazing that you know, kid.

48
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Some years ago, it was discovered in Japan

49
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,020
and was big news.

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
You see how its back is red?

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
That's why it's called the "Seakagoke" spider.

52
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
It's also called the red-back spider.

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,420
It's a poisonous spider

54
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,420
that lives mainly in Australia and Central America.

55
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,020
You mean a venomous spider is in Beika-cho?

56
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,120
"Miwa Yasuda (28)" -No, we're borrowing this yard to take pictures.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm a reporter.

58
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,320
We're making this magazine.

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
We're doing a venomous spider special in our next week edition.

60
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,620
See.

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,020
Then, that spider is...

62
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,820
He's my pet.

63
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,720
Pet?

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Although I may not look it,

65
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,920
I'm quite well-known as a "venomous spider freak".

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,420
I have a variety of venomous spider pets.

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
We're leaving to interview the professor,

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,620
so call him, will you?

69
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,820
Yes, ma'am...

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,820
Hello, Professor, this is Urazaki.

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,220
What's the matter, professor?

72
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,320
It bit me! The black widow spider bit me!

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
What?

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,820
Please inject yourself with the serum! Professor!

75
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,320
The serum...

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
"Beika Agriculture University West Entrance"

77
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
"Shinno Laboratory"

78
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,720
Darn it! It won't open!

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
Here's the spare key.

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,420
Professor!

81
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,820
All of you stay here.

82
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,220
Okay.

83
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,720
Oh, no. He's dead.

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
The professor passed away.

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,620
Why?

86
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,820
Look, there is no sign that he injected the serum.

87
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,420
No way.

88
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,020
Mr. Urazaki,

89
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,720
hurry call the police.

90
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,620
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing, Miwa?

91
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,320
Look!

92
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,120
It's a venomous spider, the one that bit the professor.

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm telling you, stop it!

94
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,420
It's already dead.

95
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,520
That spider has nerve venom

96
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,820
that is several times stronger than that of the red-back spider.

97
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,920
But not strong enough for a human to die instantly.

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Don't touch it!

99
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,020
We have to leave it that way until the police get here.

100
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,720
Hey.

101
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Let me borrow it a while.

102
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,820
Hello, is this the police?

103
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,020
Yes...

104
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,020
Which means he was bitten here?

105
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,520
It's gone.

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,220
The serum for the Black Widow Spider is gone.

107
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,520
What?

108
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,220
It's always left over here and yet...

109
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
Hey, take a look.

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,320
It seems to have escaped from here.

111
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,420
He never ever forgot to close the lid before.

112
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,620
We're only human, so there are times we forget.

113
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,020
This is...

114
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Understand? Don't come in during investigation.

115
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,320
What's with him?

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,120
We're witnesses to the case too.

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,620
If you chase us away, the case won't be solved.

118
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,120
The ones who have the key to this room are Professor Shinno

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,520
and Mr. Itogawa, his assistant?

120
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,220
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,320
Mr. Urazaki, you were acquainted with the professor.

122
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,120
Were the door and windows always locked?

123
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Yes, sir. It's because a variety of venomous spiders are being bred.

124
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,620
To think that he forgot to

125
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,820
close the lid of the breeding box of venomous spiders...

126
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
Are you bothered?

127
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,920
Oh, then go ahead and think like that forever.

128
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,920
I saw something.

129
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,920
What did you see?

130
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
There's a scratch on the professor's ear

131
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,420
as if he brought the receiver to his ear without realizing that

132
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,020
the spider was there and was bitten.

133
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,820
But it seems to be rare that

134
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,520
someone who is bitten by this spider dies on the spot.

135
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,120
Conan, I just told you not to come inside!

136
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,620
Oh, just for a while.

137
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,720
Isn't this medicine for the heart?

138
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,920
Did the professor have a heart problem?

139
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes.

140
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,520
Really? I didn't know.

141
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,020
If so, it was an accident after all?

142
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,320
You're the one who called the professor, Mr. Urazaki?

143
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Yeah, but Miwa called him before I did.

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Nobody answered the phone at that time, right?

145
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,620
Right.

146
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,820
Conan! Be careful with that.

147
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,120
That's right, I have to call Pops.

148
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,720
"Urazaki Cell Phone" -Mr. Urazaki's call is here.

149
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,520
If you need to make a call, I'll lend you my cell phone.

150
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,720
It's okay. I already got through.

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,620
Hello, Pops?

152
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,620
It's the same model as the one back then.

153
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,220
So, I'm going to be a little late. Why?

154
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,220
This is not an accident!

155
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:46,965
What's the matter, Mr. Itogawa?

156
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,665
I have to attend a academic conference tomorrow.

157
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:53,565
I'm going to have to deliver the speech in place of the professor.

158
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:57,965
What? How can you talk about a conference at a time like this?

159
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:03,265
But, it's an important academic conference that was scheduled long before.

160
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,565
So if I have the documents, I can deliver the speech.

161
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:07,365
The truth is...

162
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,965
it's your research isn't it, Mr. Itogawa?

163
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:13,165
What? Is that true?

164
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:17,465
The professor was delivering speeches

165
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:19,565
on the results of Mr. Itogawa's research all this time

166
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:22,465
as if it were his own.

167
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:26,465
So he snatched away the works of his assistant.

168
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:28,465
It's the usual stuff that goes around.

169
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:33,465
Which means that you had a grudge against the professor, Mr. Itogawa!

170
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:35,065
Speak for yourself, Mr. Urazaki

171
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,465
What? Why you...

172
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,365
Come on, Mr. Urazaki.

173
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:43,265
So, do you have something against him too?

174
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:46,265
No, I don't.

175
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,665
If you've got something, will you show it to us?

176
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,065
No, it's nothing.

177
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:52,865
It's nothing, I tell you!

178
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,465
Then, please show it to us, Mr. Urazaki

179
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:56,565
Darn!

180
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,465
Those are all rare spiders

181
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,565
that aren't found in Japan.

182
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:06,165
Just what does this mean?

183
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:10,765
Mr. Urazaki was buying the spiders from the professor.

184
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:11,765
Spiders?

185
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:12,765
Yes.

186
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:16,365
Saying that it would be used for research,

187
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,665
the professor was able to get a hold of rare and valuable spiders

188
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,365
from all over the world.

189
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,565
And he's sly too.

190
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:26,565
He picks on our weaknesses and raises the price.

191
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:31,865
Moreover, you had a grudge against the professor.

192
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:34,365
Absurd, this is an accident.

193
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:38,365
He was punished for playing around with my passion for spiders.

194
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:41,965
Pops says he's figured out who the killer is!

195
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:44,665
Conan? You're still here!

196
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,765
He says that this is not an accident?

197
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:49,565
Right, he says that it's strange that

198
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:52,665
only the serum for the Black Widow Spider is missing.

199
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,465
It's true that everything fits in too well

200
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,665
if it isn't an accident.

201
00:13:56,665 --> 00:14:01,065
Mr. Itogawa, you're the only one who has the spare key.

202
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,365
Yes.

203
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:05,065
But, Mr. Itogawa, as well as Conan and the others

204
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:08,165
heard the professor scream at the same time.

205
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:13,765
Pops says to check this telephone carefully.

206
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,165
-The telephone? -What?

207
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:18,365
There's something shiny over here.

208
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:19,465
What?

209
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,965
Something is definitely inside the hole

210
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,465
just where the ear is to be placed.

211
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:32,065
It's a needle.

212
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,565
So, this is what was inside!

213
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:38,765
The tip of the needle is broken off.

214
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,465
What's up, Conan?

215
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:51,265
The toilet!

216
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,165
The tip of the needle is broken off

217
00:14:57,165 --> 00:15:00,265
so you can't tell from the exterior of the telephone.

218
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:04,665
Which means that the thing that poked the professor's ear is this needle.

219
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:08,865
Then, why did he shout, "I was bitten by a Black Widow Spider"?

220
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,665
Yes.

221
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:14,965
Mr. Mouri!

222
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,665
I've heard about the circumstances from Conan.

223
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:21,665
The killer poked a Black Widow Spider on to the needle point

224
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:25,565
of the thumbtack that was rigged inside.

225
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,465
Take a very close look using the magnifying glass

226
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:30,165
at that dead spider over there.

227
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,365
-Wait. -Hey, Takagi.

228
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,465
I see!

229
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:45,865
Takagi, hurry and explain it to us too.

230
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:49,065
Hey, Mouri! Just what are you trying to get to?

231
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:52,265
In other words, Inspector! This is how it is...

232
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:06,865
The killer who rigged the needle into the telephone

233
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:11,365
pokes a spider that is killed beforehand onto the tip of the needle,

234
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,265
to make the professor mistakenly think

235
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,765
that he is bitten by a Black Widow Spider.

236
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,665
Then for the serum.

237
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:21,465
The killer steals the serum for the Black Widow Spider.

238
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:24,465
After all is done, the killer replaces the phone

239
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:26,765
and just waits for the professor to pick up the phone.

240
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,865
So, that's the story.

241
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,865
Which means that the professor died because...

242
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,865
Hello, Professor Shinno, this is Urazaki.

243
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:44,765
It bit me! The black widow spider bit me!

244
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:49,665
Please inject yourself with the serum! Professor! The serum!

245
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,365
It's gone!

246
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,265
The serum is gone!

247
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:14,065
All right, Mr. Mouri, goodbye then.

248
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:19,465
Inspector, the professor did not die from the venom of the spider.

249
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:20,465
Which means?

250
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,565
Since he's a venomous spider researcher,

251
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:26,265
he is well aware of the danger of spider venom.

252
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,665
He had to inject himself immediately with the serum,

253
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:31,265
but he couldn't find it.

254
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:32,865
Since the professor had a weak heart,

255
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,465
if cornered into such a situation.

256
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:38,165
I see, if the person has a weak heart,

257
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,765
the sudden stress make induce an attack.

258
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:42,465
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,965
Which means that the killer is someone

260
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,265
who can go in and out at will from the research lab,

261
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,765
as well as know about the professor's weak heart.

262
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,265
Just what proof do you have to say something like that?

263
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:57,165
Mr. Mouri said,

264
00:17:57,165 --> 00:18:00,765
"look at the incoming calls record of the telephone".

265
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:03,965
"Urazaki Cell Phone" -12:50 pm, Urazaki cell phone.

266
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,965
I made the call and the professor answered.

267
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:12,165
"University Clerk Office" -5:30 pm, university clerk office.

268
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,865
This is yesterday's record,

269
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:15,665
it has nothing to do with today.

270
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:16,965
Strange,

271
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:20,965
Yasuda should've called the professor once before I gave him a call.

272
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,465
The time was 12:00 pm

273
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:25,965
because the lunch break time tone of the factory.

274
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:30,265
Oh, I seemed to have called the wrong number back then.

275
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,965
Will you please show me your cell phone?

276
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:41,865
She's definitely called a different number.

277
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:46,065
Huh? That cell phone's the same as Mr. Itokawa's.

278
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,365
What? Oh, it's just a coincidence.

279
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:54,165
Pops said that Mr. Itokawa is protecting you.

280
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,065
He said that you're going out with each other.

281
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,065
What?

282
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,765
Although it's already an old model,

283
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:01,365
it's unusual that you both still use the same type

284
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,565
but of a different color.

285
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,465
I see.

286
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,465
If you two are going with each other,

287
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:09,565
Ms. Yasuda would have the opportunity

288
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,865
to make a spare key from the key that Mr. Itokawa has.

289
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:14,765
Besides that, she's knowledgeable about spiders

290
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,765
thanks to Mr. Itogawa telling her about them.

291
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,565
It's not all that strange that she could've known

292
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,665
that the professor had a weak heart.

293
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:25,965
Wait, it's true that we're going with each other.

294
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,165
But, that isn't reason enough to be suspicious of her.

295
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,365
We've got proof.

296
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:35,565
The seal with the blue flower on it, that's in your pocket.

297
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:41,065
We saw you secretly pick it up from the floor, Mr. Itogawa.

298
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:43,065
Will you please give it to me?

299
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:53,465
That's the nail art seal that you're using, isn't it?

300
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,565
No, it's not.

301
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,765
See?

302
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:02,065
Can you show me the magazine you showed me a while ago?

303
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:04,565
Yes.

304
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,965
It's here.

305
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:12,965
See.

306
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,065
It's real!

307
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:19,665
Didn't you drop it today in this room?

308
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:26,465
If so, why did Mr. Itogawa try to hide the evidence?

309
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:33,265
You came here today before the professor came, didn't you?

310
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,665
Mr. Itogawa realized what you did and tried to hide the evidence.

311
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:40,965
Look at the antenna of that cell phone!

312
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,165
Isn't it full of scratches?

313
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:45,465
Yeah, now that you mentioned it.

314
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,765
There were scratches on the telephone over there too, weren't there?

315
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:52,865
I see.

316
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:55,065
She used the antenna of the cell phone

317
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,665
and stuck the needle into the receiver.

318
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:58,165
That's when the scratches were made.

319
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,065
I'm telling you, stop it!

320
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:19,165
You killed the professor

321
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:21,565
and tried to make it look as if he died accidentally.

322
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:23,965
You made Mr. Urazaki call

323
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:28,165
because you didn't want suspicion to fall upon Mr. Itogawa or yourself.

324
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,065
Why did you do something like this?

325
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:33,765
Whenever the professor delivers a speech at the academic conference,

326
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:36,865
it is Mr. Itogawa's research results.

327
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:39,165
I just couldn't take it anymore.

328
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,565
I was just hoping that the professor would be hospitalized

329
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:44,565
with a heart attack or something.

330
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,065
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

331
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,165
Miwa.

332
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:56,365
This is a crime that cannot be forgiven.

333
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:59,465
After all, you did take someone's life.

334
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:31,665
So, the spider was innocent after all.

335
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:35,165
Because if you take a good look at it, it's small and cute.

336
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,565
I guess you're right.

337
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:39,365
Conan, there's a spider on your shoulder!

338
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:42,465
Don't worry, it's not a venomous spider.

339
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:46,265
That spider's the one that was in the professor's breeding box!

340
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:50,365
What? Do something, please. Haibara!

341
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:51,565
I'm just joking!

342
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,965
You guys! Just keep laughing.

343
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:34,292
Next Conan's Hint:

344
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,792
"Cigarette"

345
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,392
Coming up next is a 1 hour special.

346
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,392
-The beautiful image. -The cursed mask.

347
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:40,892
Don't miss it.
