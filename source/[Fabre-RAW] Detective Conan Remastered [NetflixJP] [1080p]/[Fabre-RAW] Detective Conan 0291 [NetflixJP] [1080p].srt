1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,470
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,170
It's summer, the ocean, and the islands!

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,170
Start of the case written on the sand.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,670
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,610
All right, then. That girl with short brown hair is next.

9
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,010
Her suit's dotted and kind of dull,

10
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,610
so how about the one in the dark one piece.

11
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,610
No, she's kind of chubby.

12
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,010
She is wearing that black bikini to make herself look thinner.

13
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,210
See, I told you. I win again.

14
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,010
You're not very good when it comes to solving this kind of mystery.

15
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,010
Shut up.

16
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,310
What are you two talking about?

17
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,910
Kazuha.

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,810
Ran.

19
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,510
Playing "Guess what's kind of swimsuit she's wearing"

20
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,710
with the little boy.

21
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,610
If your parents could see you now,

22
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,310
I'm sure they'd be crying their eyes out.

23
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,710
You don't understand.

24
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,610
This kid kept bugging me about it, I had no choice.

25
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,710
Heiji's really good.

26
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,710
He guessed right off

27
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,310
that you'd be wearing a tiger striped swimsuit, Kazuha!

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,610
Shut up!

29
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,210
Tiger striped? You call these tiger stripes?

30
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,210
This is a zebra print. Zebra.

31
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,710
What's the difference?

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,710
The only stripes that matter in Osaka are tiger stripes.

33
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,710
Yes, you're right.

34
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,110
Kazuha.

35
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,010
You're not mad at me

36
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,510
for making you wait in front of Big Man in Umeda, are you?

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,010
Don't be silly.

38
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,110
Why would I be mad at a stupid boy for making me wait four hours?

39
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,610
I'm not the least bit mad! Not one bit!

40
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,010
She's furious.

41
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,110
I don't blame her.

42
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,810
Just calm down, he invited you to Okinawa to make up for it, didn't he?

43
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,110
I'm not here because he invited me.

44
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,710
I only came here because your father brought me.

45
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,210
Your father, the Sleeping Kogoro.

46
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,110
Tomorrow's the big day, isn't it?

47
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,210
The battle of the best detectives from the East and West!

48
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,710
How do you feel? Are you confident you'll win?

49
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,810
Confident?

50
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,510
No one can be completely confident of anything.

51
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,610
All I'm certain of is, I, Kogoro Mouri will not lose to a kid from Osaka

52
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,610
who's still wet behind the ears, that much, I'm sure of.

53
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,210
The old fool.

54
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,710
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 1)"

55
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,810
Will all the staff gather round?

56
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,010
We're going to go check things out soon!

57
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,010
Check things out?

58
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,810
Yeah, we're going to check out the area on the island,

59
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,110
you and Mr. Mouri are going to tomorrow.

60
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,110
"Masao Taketomi (43)" -It's an uninhabited island,

61
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,910
a body and some strange words were found there.

62
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,610
You want to come along? Young detective from the East.

63
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,010
Might be interesting...

64
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,410
I might be cheating by taking a look around before them,

65
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,910
but if that Kudo helps the old man

66
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,710
and just by chance, he solves the mystery before me,

67
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,910
it's going to burn me up.

68
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,110
Okay, then. I'm going to go check things out with them!

69
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,410
Hey.

70
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,010
That's fine.

71
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,110
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,810
We're going to put our heads together

73
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,610
and solve the mystery in no time.

74
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,710
To show all the people in Osaka

75
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,710
that we're smarter than the detectives in Tokyo!

76
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,710
But I'm from Tokyo.

77
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,410
Look, that's it!

78
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,310
That's Funaura Island where the unidentified body was found!

79
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,110
It's nicknamed Onikame Island.

80
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,710
Onikame Island?

81
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,010
Take a look.

82
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,610
The tip of the island looks like a turtle's head, doesn't it?

83
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,010
And then? So why are you and old Kogoro going there to solve a mystery?

84
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,710
I guess it's some sort of local event they came up with.

85
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,210
Mr. Kaneshiro's the mayor of that island we were just on,

86
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,710
he told me that members of his family have been kidnapped and robbed,

87
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,410
that's why the island has a bad reputation

88
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,910
and tourism has gone down the drain,

89
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,910
so he called the television station

90
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,810
and they came up with an idea to improve the island's image.

91
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,010
It seems the mayor owns that island, too.

92
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,910
I don't think solving the mystery behind a murder

93
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,010
is going to improve the island's image, though.

94
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,410
They're from the television station,

95
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,710
but Mr. Taketomi's the only one with television experience,

96
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,510
the others are locals who know this area well.

97
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,310
Where're you girls from?

98
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,810
Tokyo?

99
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,210
-Yes. -I'm from Osaka!

100
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,710
"Yoshizuki Kume (25)" -Then how about coming diving with us

101
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,310
after tomorrow's shoot?

102
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,010
"Noburou lkema (24)" -We live here so we know some great spots.

103
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,510
Oh no, no way!

104
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,810
Their schedule's full for today, tomorrow and the day after.

105
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,410
You can't expect them to stick a tube in their mouth

106
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,810
and put fins on their feet to make them look like penguins

107
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,310
so that they can waste time staring at fish in the ocean with you guys!

108
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,410
Huh? Who the hell are you?

109
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,310
Is that kid your boyfriend or something?

110
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,910
I'm glad you asked that.

111
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,910
She's my...

112
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,610
I'm his...

113
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,210
She's nothing

114
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,610
but just an old friend.

115
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,310
And she's a real pest, so you better not try anything with her!

116
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,810
He's not making a lot of sense...

117
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,710
So what's your business then?

118
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,210
Why are you on this boat anyway? You're not part of the crew.

119
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,610
He's Heiji Hatton, the detective from the East.

120
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,810
"Yoshie Taira (26)" -He's one of the main guests,

121
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,510
he's Kogoro Mouri's opponent.

122
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,310
This kid?

123
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,610
But he's still just a kid.

124
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,210
That's what makes it so interesting!

125
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,010
The popular high school detective...

126
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,710
challenges Kogoro Mouri. How's that?

127
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,210
I'm challenging that old fool?

128
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,610
Who cares about that?

129
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,010
Just do what you came here to do

130
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,010
and then let's get back as soon as possible.

131
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,010
"Mikihito Daito (47)" -They say that when it gets dark around here,

132
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,010
"guso's messenger" comes for the "mabui".

133
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,610
Right, captain?

134
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,510
"Takashi Shimoji (38), Crew"

135
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,810
Guso's messenger?

136
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,010
Comes for the mabui?

137
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,010
"Guso" means the nether world,

138
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,110
and "mabui" means soul.

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,510
It's an old Okinawa legend.

140
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,610
When a woman is up all night whiling time away...

141
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,910
The messenger from the other world dressed in death's robes

142
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,010
rises silently from the ocean

143
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,210
and sucks her soul out, so they say.

144
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,210
You're giving me the creeps!

145
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,310
I was planning on going for a swim when we go to the island.

146
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,210
It's probably white.

147
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,210
That girl's swimsuit, I bet it's a white high leg cut.

148
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,810
Who cares?

149
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,810
Hey, captain! Don't make so much waves!

150
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,110
She's wearing a black wetsuit.

151
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,810
Huh? That's strange.

152
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,610
From what I've heard, this island...

153
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,210
Heiji!

154
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,910
The director's calling you!

155
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,110
You've got to get to work now.

156
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,710
Yeah. I know...

157
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,310
"The princess sleeps, not in B but in A".

158
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,410
Are you sure the body was found in front of this pillar

159
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,210
with the words carved?

160
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,410
That's right.

161
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,910
He was leaning against it, the words behind him.

162
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,410
They found him a year ago, he died of starvation,

163
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,410
he hadn't eaten or drunk anything for who knows how long.

164
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,010
It was exactly a year ago that several big typhoons passed through here,

165
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,710
so everyone figured he was a crew member

166
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,810
from some shipwrecked ship and got washed up here,

167
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,610
that's what the locals told me.

168
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,910
These strange words puzzle me.

169
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,310
By the way, who built this place?

170
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,910
This island's uninhabited. Who's place is this?

171
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,110
It's Mayor Kaneshiro's.

172
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,710
It seems he used to use it as a vacation house.

173
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,810
It looks like he hasn't fixed it

174
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,410
the typhoon wrecked it, though.

175
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,410
I knew it was white.

176
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,610
You're right, it doesn't look Iike it did the last time I saw it.

177
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,610
I feel like I'm in another dimension.

178
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,210
You mean you come to this island a lot?

179
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,810
Yeah, until two years ago,

180
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,110
I used to look out at this from my ship.

181
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,710
The ocean around here's full of brown striped mackerel scad.

182
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,810
Brown striped mackerel scad?

183
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,910
You guys did too, didn't you?

184
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,710
Yeah. There's a great diving spot right at the tip of this island.

185
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,710
But ever since they found that body, nobody comes near here.

186
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,810
It gives them the creeps.

187
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,210
Oh, well,

188
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,310
Heiji and I will be discussing things around here,

189
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,610
so you go look for other spooky areas on this island.

190
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,410
Look for something that you think will solve this mystery.

191
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,710
Okay.

192
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,510
What?

193
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,410
He doesn't make this show sound so serious.

194
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,110
I bet he doesn't believe in me.

195
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,710
The princess sleeps, not in B but A.

196
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,410
A and B probably refers to 1, 2 and 3.

197
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,110
That means "The princess is sleeping in number 1, not 2".

198
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,010
Hey, Kudo. You got any ideas?

199
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,010
No, nothing.

200
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,510
You sure you haven't figured it out already,

201
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,710
but you don't want to tell me cause you want to beat me?

202
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,510
I wouldn't do that.

203
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,310
Listen, maybe it means the princess sleeping face is the prettiest?

204
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,310
Hey, wait.

205
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,610
Maybe it means

206
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,610
the princess who's usually pretty looks gross when she is sleeping?

207
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,110
That's not grossly impossible.

208
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,010
Hey! Pretty good!

209
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,110
Stop gabbing, ninnies!

210
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,010
Seriously!

211
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,010
Ms. Taira's late. I wonder where she is?

212
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,810
You're right.

213
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,410
It's been about an hour since the rest of us got back to the ship.

214
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,010
Do you think she's still diving?

215
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,310
It's possible.

216
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,510
-Wait up! -Heiji!

217
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,910
I'll search from this side up to the shore.

218
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,010
Okay. I'll take this side!

219
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,010
Hey, Miss Taira! Where are you?

220
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,410
Miss Taira! Miss Taira!

221
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,110
Hey!

222
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,410
Miss Taira.

223
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,610
Miss Taira!

224
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,110
"I am the 'guso's messenger'." (I Death's messenger)

225
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,810
What?

226
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,910
Miss Taira's been murdered?

227
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,610
I can't believe it.

228
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,310
You've got to be kidding!

229
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,510
She was killed about 2 hours ago.

230
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,510
She has strangled something like a thin rope.

231
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,310
She probably got those scratches on her arms and legs

232
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,310
when she struggled as she was being strangled.

233
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,110
Which means the murderer killed her in the woods,

234
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,610
then carried her out her to the beach,

235
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,610
and ran away not too long ago

236
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,710
after leaving this weird message in the sand.

237
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,810
"I am the 'guso's messenger'"?

238
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,810
Hey, young detective.

239
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,310
How do you know that the murderer ran away not too long ago?

240
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,110
It's easy!

241
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,910
Look over there!

242
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,510
The sand's wet up till there.

243
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,210
That means the water was up to there during the high tide.

244
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,910
But the waves are just below the words now,

245
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,910
you'd have had to write them recently

246
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,010
when the tide was low or the waves would wash them away.

247
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,010
Let me also add that

248
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,910
this place is exactly on the other side of the boat landing.

249
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,710
We were all on the boat an hour ago waiting for her to get back.

250
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,310
This kid and I were the first to go look for her,

251
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,310
we split up and went around the island,

252
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,310
then we found her body, which means...

253
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,910
there's somebody else on this island besides us.

254
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,010
And that person strangled her to death.

255
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,510
No way.

256
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,410
Somebody besides us?

257
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,010
Kazuha, you've got a digital camera, don't you?

258
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,310
Yes. I have it with me.

259
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,710
All right then, Kudo.

260
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,810
Let me have that glowing watch of yours and one side of your sandal.

261
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,210
I understand about the watch but why my sandal?

262
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,010
Oh, I get it.

263
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,410
You needed something to show how big the words were.

264
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,710
I have to take a picture now

265
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,310
or they'll get washed away at the next high tide.

266
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,410
Hey, what is this? You didn't need my watch.

267
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,210
I guess not.

268
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,410
Okay then, let's carry her body back to the boat

269
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,910
before she gets washed out to sea.

270
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,110
Okay.

271
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,610
Who'd want to kill her though?

272
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,510
Maybe there's something in the ocean?

273
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,510
Something inside the ocean?

274
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,710
You remember, she went snorkeling as soon as she got to this island.

275
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,810
I'm sure there's something there

276
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,310
for her to be so dead set on diving here.

277
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,810
What do you think they mean?

278
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,610
I don't know, but I think it'd be better if we went back to the boat now

279
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,510
and wait for daylight before we investigate.

280
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,510
I knew he'd say that.

281
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,710
Hey, what'd you done that for?

282
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,210
I don't believe him.

283
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,310
He threw my sandal knowing I'd see him and try to stop him.

284
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,510
Somebody stop Heiji!

285
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,310
He's going to go into the ocean!

286
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,210
So what? He's just going for a swim.

287
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,910
But the key to the murder's in the ocean?

288
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,010
That kid's got guts!

289
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,910
The current around here is fast and to dive at night is reckless,

290
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,110
even a professional diver could end up losing his life.

291
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,310
What?

292
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,010
I'm pretty sure it was around here.

293
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,010
Heiji, don't do it!

294
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,410
It's dangerous!

295
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,010
Heiji!

296
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,710
What's that?

297
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,910
There's something black down there.

298
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,910
That's...

299
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,610
an anchor?

300
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,810
Heiji!

301
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,810
Heiji!

302
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,110
There he is!

303
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,810
Heiji.

304
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,110
Hey, you swim pretty fast!

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,410
The current swept me away, you fool!

306
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,310
What? You mean you knew the current around here was fast?

307
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,910
Yeah.

308
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,810
Remember what those guys said?

309
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,810
About there is a lot of brown striped mackerel scads around here.

310
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,310
Well, they're migratory fish

311
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,710
that swim in waters where there's a fast current

312
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,410
and there were a lot of seagulls flying around trying to get the fish.

313
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,010
Is that why you rushed out to look for Miss Taira?

314
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,210
That's right.

315
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,610
I figured that if she was still diving at that time,

316
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,110
she might've been carried out to sea.

317
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,010
But Heiji, you try too hard to look good!

318
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,510
You dummy! I just wanted to solve this case as soon as possible.

319
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,010
Yeah, sure!

320
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,610
I'm sure Heiji wouldn't be so sneaky and cheat

321
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,210
by getting as much information possible beforehand

322
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,410
so that he can beat Uncle Kogoro tomorrow.

323
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,110
You know me. I wouldn't do that.

324
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,710
Anyway, let's take Miss Taira's body back to the cruiser first,

325
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,110
then talk things over.

326
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,410
Where did you say you were taking the body?

327
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,310
You heard me. I said the cruiser...

328
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,810
-What? -The cruiser's gone!

329
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,710
Hey, do you think that captain panicked

330
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,410
when he heard somebody got killed and left us here?

331
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,410
Fool! The only ones who know it was murder are us,

332
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,410
we're the ones who found the body.

333
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,910
Then maybe he's the murderer.

334
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,710
After we all left to look for Miss Taira,

335
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,710
he took the cruiser and got ahead of us,

336
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,810
carried her body out to the beach and wrote those words.

337
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,710
Impossible.

338
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,010
Conan and I were scouring the shoreline at that time.

339
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,610
We'd have noticed if the cruiser went past us.

340
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,510
It doesn't matter anyway.

341
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,410
It seems that the captain holds the key to this crime.

342
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,210
Well, anyway.

343
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,610
We just have to wait for someone to come rescue us.

344
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,410
Yes, you're right.

345
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,710
When the TV station realizes their staff hasn't returned by nightfall,

346
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,610
I'm sure they'll come looking.

347
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,010
Don't hold your breath.

348
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:25,010
We weren't supposed to come here until tomorrow.

349
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,610
We were having such a hard time getting the boat and setting things up,

350
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,010
so we decided to come here today instead,

351
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,410
and we didn't tell the producer.

352
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,710
You've got to be kidding!

353
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,810
Are you telling me no one knows we're on this deserted island?

354
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,410
Yeah.

355
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,610
I told them we'd get everything done tomorrow.

356
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,710
I just hope you and that captain didn't plan this

357
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,710
to bring the ratings up!

358
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,210
Of course, not.

359
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,510
Don't worry. Everything will be fine!

360
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,010
I'm sure Ran's father will notice we're not back,

361
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,110
he'll come looking for us.

362
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,410
Let's wait inside that house!

363
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,310
Boy, this "awamori" is the best!

364
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,410
Yes.

365
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,510
It is this is a well cured sake, I ordered it special so you'd relax

366
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,410
and your wits would be sharpened for tomorrow's match.

367
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,810
"Hyougo Kaneshiro (63)" -I'll be counting on you

368
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,210
to solve the mystery tomorrow, Detective Mouri.

369
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,710
Whatever the outcome, I'll be prepared for it.

370
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,910
I wonder what's keeping that Hattori fellow,

371
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,610
your daughter and the others?

372
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,710
Oh, you don't have to worry about them.

373
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,110
He probably doesn't want to face me the night before the match.

374
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,910
That seems pretty immature.

375
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,310
Let's forget about those kids,

376
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,910
I intend to drink until morning and sharpen my wits!

377
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,410
Here's to my victory!

378
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,810
I think we're in a lot of trouble here.

379
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,410
I think so, too.

380
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,600
"Automatic Pilot"

382
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,780
The next episode will present us with another mystery.

383
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:07,840
You can leave that to me!
The next episode will present us with another mystery.

384
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
You can leave that to me!

385
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:38,690
So you say but you seem to be having a very hard time.
