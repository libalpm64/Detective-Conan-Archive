1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,640
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,440
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
Danger is closing in, Haibara and Conan.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,240
There are many people appearing in this episode.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,940
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,190
On the way home from school,

10
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,890
Haibara and I ran into Gin's car.

11
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,790
One of the Black Organization members.

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,790
I set a transmitter and wiretap in his car

13
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,990
and pursue them!

14
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,190
However, Gin destroyed the wiretap when he found them.

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,690
They have realized the existence of Haibara!

16
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,290
We found out about their murder plans via wire tap.

17
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,090
So we headed to a farewell party of a movie director

18
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,490
which are held at the Haido City Hotel.

19
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,890
Hey, that politician's gone!

20
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,590
What?

21
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,690
What was that?

22
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,490
A handkerchief?

23
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:00,090
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Conan Part)"

24
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,290
The chandelier...

25
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,990
What happened?

26
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,490
This is...

27
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,490
What happened?

28
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,290
I don't know.

29
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,890
What is going on?

30
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,090
I wonder.

31
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,690
What on earth is it?

32
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,390
Hey! Will somebody explain what's going on?

33
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,190
Quiet please, everyone!

34
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,190
I am Inspector Megure of the police department!

35
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,690
You're here so early for a change.

36
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,690
I received a report from someone

37
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,590
saying that someone will commit a murder here tonight.

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,190
That someone was after the life of Mr. Nomiguchi!

39
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,090
How is he, Officer Takagi?

40
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,290
No good. He is not breathing.

41
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,490
I see. Contact the department right away.

42
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,890
Yes, sir!

43
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,190
He's the killer.

44
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,990
One of the Black Organization's mens who shrunk my body.

45
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,090
Codename, Pisco!

46
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,090
He's still somewhere in here!

47
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,390
Oh. I see.

48
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,590
Then you were the ones closest to Mr. Nomiguchi

49
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,590
when the chandelier came falling?

50
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,590
Yes.

51
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,990
Did you see anyone suspicious at that time?

52
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,490
"Yoshiharu Tawara (58)" -I didn't have time to look

53
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,690
because I was almost crushed by the chandelier too.

54
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,790
Take a look at this!

55
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,290
The chandelier skimmed my suit and it tore.

56
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,690
"Chris Vineyard (29) -I never saw any suspicious characters.

57
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,190
I see.

58
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,590
Inspector, she says she hasn't seen anyone suspicious.

59
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,190
It's an accident, a mere accident!

60
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,490
"Naoya Tarumi (35)" -The chain of the chandelier

61
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,090
old and broke off,

62
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,390
and the politician coincidentally got crushed to death under it.

63
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,890
But somebody reported that

64
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,090
there was going to be a murder, right?

65
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,290
What about that?

66
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,990
"Kenzo Masuyama (71)" -Before you suspect us,

67
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,590
I would sure like to know more

68
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,390
about the person who reported the murder.

69
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,190
After all, that person may be the murderer.

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,690
The person was using a voice changer

71
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,490
that we couldn't make out whether it was a man or woman.

72
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,590
"Naomichi Mugikura (43)" -It could've been a prank then.

73
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,590
Many people detested Nomiguchi

74
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,390
for being suspected of bribery.

75
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,890
That's right...

76
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,590
And the accident happened to

77
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,090
take place after the prank call.

78
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,790
"Yasuo Mihei (62)" -He was punished by the heavens!

79
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,290
You really can't get away with evil doings, right?

80
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,390
I don't see how you can eat in this situation.

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,890
I wish timid greenhorns would shut up!

82
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,190
Hey, somebody go get the chef!

83
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,390
What the matter?

84
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,690
Did you find a cockroach in there or something?

85
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,890
That's because you at a time like this.

86
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,090
You're being punished by the heavens too!

87
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,090
What?

88
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,990
-Come, now, let's all calm down. -This is...

89
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,290
A piece of broken chain from the chandelier?

90
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,790
Why is this in there?

91
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,890
"Mika Nanjo (38)" -Anyway, politician Nomiguchi died

92
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,390
because the chandelier falls on top of him, right?

93
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,490
If it were homicide,

94
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,790
then there would have had to be a rig of some kind,

95
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,390
and somebody would've had to lure him under the chandelier

96
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,890
after the place got dark.

97
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,390
But there seems to be

98
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,890
no such thing on the chandelier or the ceiling

99
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,390
that it was hanging from either.

100
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,890
Therefore, murder'd be impossible!

101
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,490
Now, that it's cleared.

102
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,390
May I please be excused?

103
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,590
That's true.

104
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,790
Dropping the chandelier on the target in the dark,

105
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,290
unless something were to be set up in advance, it's impossible.

106
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,690
But, the killer succeeded in doing so.

107
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,790
How?

108
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,090
Hey, where're we going?

109
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,390
We're getting out of here.

110
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,290
It's too dangerous to spend meaningless time here any longer!

111
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,490
Besides, if Inspector Megure and the others see us here,

112
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,690
how are we going to explain why we're here?

113
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,890
The only clue is the broken off piece of chain

114
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,490
that you picked up a while ago.

115
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,090
You couldn't possibly figure out

116
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,090
who the killer is with just that.

117
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,490
What if I have two clues?

118
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,090
After the chandelier fell and before the lights came back on,

119
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,690
something came falling.

120
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,390
This handkerchief.

121
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,690
So what?

122
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,590
The name of the killer is not written on it, is it?

123
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,390
See, look in the corner of this handkerchief the words,

124
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,390
"Farewell Party for Director Sakamaki" are sewn on.

125
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,190
The owner of this handkerchief

126
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,890
received it here at the reception desk!

127
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,590
Besides, look at everyone around you.

128
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,290
See, that man with the glass cup,

129
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,390
the plump lady next to him,

130
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,890
and the old man with the beard who is beyond,

131
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,590
they all have handkerchiefs.

132
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,890
The colors are different!

133
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,390
What does that mean?

134
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,690
Probably because they passed out handkerchieves of

135
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,790
seven different colors in memory of

136
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,290
Director Sakamaki's best movie, "Rainbow Colored Handkerchief"

137
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,690
In other words, if we check at the reception desk

138
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,290
on who received purple handkerchiefs,

139
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,190
we can more or less have a clue!

140
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,290
But, we won't be able to determine

141
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,490
whether the owner is involved with the killing.

142
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,390
Yeah. We still can't tell what it was used for

143
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,190
or whether it belongs to the killer or not.

144
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,590
But, the possibility that it has nothing to do with the killing

145
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,390
is not zero, right?

146
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,790
Excuse me, officer.

147
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,490
May I go to the restroom?

148
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,690
Okay.

149
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,290
Hey, hold it, what're you all doing here?

150
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,690
Is it true that politician Nomiguchi passed away?

151
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,490
I hear it was an accident?

152
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,890
How about it?

153
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,390
We'll explain everything later,

154
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,790
so stand back everyone!

155
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,790
Hey, wait!

156
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,590
Please answer us!

157
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,490
"Enter keyword"

158
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,790
Who did I gave the purple handkerchief to?

159
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,790
Yep! I picked that handkerchief up,

160
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,990
so I want to give it back to the owner!

161
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,590
That handkerchief was supposed to be used for something later, right?

162
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,590
Yes, at the end of the gathering,

163
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,690
a certain color of handkerchief was supposed be chosen,

164
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,890
and the people with it were supposed to make comments.

165
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,890
Can you give me the names!

166
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,390
I'll go look for the person who lost it.

167
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,290
What shall we do, Inspector?

168
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,790
If we hold them back any longer,

169
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,790
we may cause a racket.

170
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,590
It looks like an accident no matter how you look at it too,

171
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,390
so maybe we should let them go for now.

172
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,490
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,090
I've found the person, sonny!

174
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,390
This is the name of the seven people

175
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,390
who are in the room now.

176
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,890
-There! -Thank you!

177
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,190
I see.

178
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,990
Those seven people.

179
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,790
I can't be absolutely sure

180
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,790
but maybe one of their members Pisco is among the seven.

181
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,390
Hey, they're coming out!

182
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,390
Excuse me, were you nearby when the accident occurred?

183
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,290
I don't know! Get out of my way!

184
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,490
Please tell us the details of the accident

185
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,990
Ask the police, not me!

186
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,190
Darn it, let's go back to Dr. Agasa's car for now.

187
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,290
Haibara!

188
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,490
Hey, Haibara?

189
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,090
Where are you? Answer me!

190
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,790
Wait!

191
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,290
Hey, where are you?

192
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,690
Answer me!

193
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,190
Haibara!

194
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,270
Haibara.

195
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,470
Wake up, Haibara.

196
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,270
Haibara...

197
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,470
What's the matter?

198
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,270
We're having class now.

199
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,670
"The Giant Turnip. Grandfather. Grandmother."

200
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,670
Could it be because of your cold?

201
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,870
Maybe you should go rest in the infirmary after all.

202
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,070
A dream?

203
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,270
Right...

204
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,270
It can't be a coincidence that I ran into him in town.

205
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,170
All my dreams have been the same recently.

206
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,470
I wonder if I'm tired?

207
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,370
Haibara.

208
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,170
Answer me, Haibara.

209
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,470
-Who is it? -Hey, Haibara!

210
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,470
Who is it?

211
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,870
Haibara!

212
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,070
Who is it?

213
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,270
Haibara!

214
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,470
Kudo?

215
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,370
Haibara? Is that you, Haibara?

216
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,370
Where are you?

217
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,270
In Dr. Agasa's car in front of the hotel!

218
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm using the built in microphone and speaker in my glasses

219
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,970
and communicating with you.

220
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,170
What happened to me?

221
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,170
That's what I'd like to know!

222
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,070
What happened in the corridor in front of the hall?

223
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,770
In front of the hall?

224
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,270
Oh, I was swallowed by the crowd of people

225
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,470
and lost track of you.

226
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,270
Then somebody came at me from behind.

227
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,370
What did that person do from behind?

228
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,970
Somebody made me sniff something

229
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,770
and it looks like I'm confined in a wine cellar or something.

230
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,770
Hey, don't tell me that...

231
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,970
Yes. The one who committed the murder under police surveillance

232
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,170
under the very eyes of the police is one of

233
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,670
the members of the organization...

234
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,870
Pisco!

235
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,370
What?

236
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,570
Don't tell me that he is close to you?

237
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,270
No, that person is not here right now.

238
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,470
The door of this room is securely locked, though.

239
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,570
The only that I see here are

240
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,970
a cardboard box on a baggage cart,

241
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,470
and a janitor's overalls.

242
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,570
Overalls?

243
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,970
Yes. After I was made to sniff something,

244
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,470
he probably took me to the restroom

245
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,170
and changed into overalls,

246
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,770
then, he put me in this cardboard box

247
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,570
and brought me here.

248
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,470
I think that if he goofed killing that politician in the hall,

249
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,270
he was going to carry out the killing the restroom

250
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,770
and bring him here.

251
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,170
Okay, we've got to find a way to get out of there

252
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,470
and plan our next move.

253
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,870
Listen, Kudo. Listen very carefully.

254
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,070
The word "Apo" in the Apotoxin 4869

255
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,570
that shrunk our body, which stands for apoptosis.

256
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,670
In other words, it means the death of a program.

257
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,270
Yes. The cells have a self-destruction structure

258
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,470
and is existing because of a signal that keeps that in check.

259
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,570
Hey, Haibara.

260
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,470
But, this drug not only guides apoptosis,

261
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,670
it also waits for the activation of trimorphism

262
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,070
and increases cell multiplication efficiency.

263
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,470
Cut it out, Haibara!

264
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,570
I'll listen to all you have to say

265
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,070
after you get out of there.

266
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,070
Never mind, and just listen, will you?

267
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,870
Because I'm never going to be able to...

268
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,870
to talk to you again.

269
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,070
-What? -Can't you tell?

270
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,970
They kidnapped me and locked me here

271
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,670
despite me being a child.

272
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,070
Even if I were to able to get out of here,

273
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,270
they would track me down in a day or two.

274
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,570
If that happens,

275
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,470
they will annihilate Dr. Agasa, who had sheltered me,

276
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,370
as well as everyone I am involved with

277
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,770
in order to protect their secret.

278
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,170
Now, do you understand?

279
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,270
Whether I am killed here

280
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,570
or get out of here,

281
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:04,270
I will never be able to see all of you again.

282
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,170
Haibara.

283
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,570
That's why I'm going to give you

284
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,770
all the information on the drug while I can.

285
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,070
"The Great Adventure of Dr. Agasa Part II"!

286
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,170
Hey, what was that?

287
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,870
The game that Dr. Agasa made that Mitsuhiko gave back to me at school.

288
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,670
They probably checked the MO that was in my pocket.

289
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,770
A cellular phone connected to the computer means...

290
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,570
Just as I thought.

291
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,070
They were searching my face.

292
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,070
Hey, you're not tied up?

293
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,570
That's why I'm rushing!

294
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,970
They wouldn't leave me for a long time

295
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,970
without even tieing me up, would they?

296
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,470
No. They won't be back for a while yet.

297
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,570
After you disappeared, I called the Inspector immediately.

298
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,870
And told him not to let the seven

299
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,670
who received the purple handkerchief out of the Haido City Hotel.

300
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,170
Using Shinichi's voice!

301
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,270
The fact that you're not tied up,

302
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,170
and that the cellular is still connected to the computer

303
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,470
show that the guy who confined you

304
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,070
wanted to leave the hotel just for awhile for something

305
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,770
but was stopped at the door by the officers,

306
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,970
and is being questioned now!

307
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,770
Moreover, it is very likely

308
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,270
that he makes contact with those outside.

309
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,770
It's been an hour since you disappeared,

310
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,070
and yet, it's unthinkable that nobody

311
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,670
including the guy who kidnapped you, went back.

312
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,170
Just as I thought.

313
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,070
The guy who committed the murder is among the seven.

314
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,470
He assassinated his target and confined you there.

315
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,770
The guy called Pisco!

316
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,270
Then, you mean I'm still inside Haido City Hotel?

317
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,970
Yeah, most probably!

318
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,870
If we can find proof that he committed the murder

319
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,370
before he contacts the others,

320
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,770
and hand him over to the police,

321
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,870
you're still safe!

322
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,670
The longest the Inspector can keep them in the room is another hour.

323
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,170
I'll go ask the employee of the hotel

324
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,970
if they have a wine cellar that's not in use,

325
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,970
and get you out of there!

326
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,370
If I say that a girl is locked in...

327
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,670
You idiot.

328
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,270
Didn't I just tell you

329
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,870
what will happen to people who get involved with me?

330
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,170
It's not my fault

331
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,970
if something happens

332
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,970
to the employee who helps me out.

333
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,670
Then, why don't you find a way

334
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,070
to get out of there yourself?

335
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,070
In the meantime,

336
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,870
I'll go and figure out which of the seven is Pisco.

337
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,370
You say it like it's so simple,

338
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,870
but there is no escape route here.

339
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,870
Only an old fireplace.

340
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,970
Can't you climb up that fireplace?

341
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,670
Impossible. It's too wide to climb.

342
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,670
If I weren't this small,

343
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,970
I could probably use my hands and legs

344
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,670
and get out of here, but...

345
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,570
Isn't there a rope or something?

346
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,570
I wonder.

347
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,770
Would they have a rope in a wine cellar?

348
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,870
Are there all kinds of liquor in there?

349
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,770
Yes. It seems that they packed liquor from all over the world

350
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,870
into this room that is not being used anymore,

351
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,770
and turned it into a wine cellar.

352
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,670
Do you see something called Paikal there?

353
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,770
Paikal?

354
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,470
Yeah, it's a very strong Chinese liquor.

355
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,070
I don't know.

356
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,370
Look for it!

357
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,370
I wonder if I can.

358
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,170
Why do you want me to look for it, anyway?

359
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,370
How's your cold?

360
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,770
Didn't you say you were coming down with one this morning?

361
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,570
What are you, a scatterbrain?

362
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,570
Never mind that. How are you feeling?

363
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,870
Thanks to being left lying on the floor for a while,

364
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,270
I think my fever went up.

365
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,370
-I see. -Oh, my.

366
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,670
You sound a bit happy?

367
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,870
Sort of.

368
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,970
I found the Paikal.

369
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,970
But, what do I do with this liquor?

370
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,270
I'm going to help you get out of there.

371
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,270
I'm going to put a real fancy spell on you!

372
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,970
That was the scene right after the accident!

373
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,970
In a room located near the scene of the accident,

374
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,870
it seems that several people

375
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,570
have been called in for questioning.

376
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,970
The names of these people have not been announced.

377
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,870
This was brought to you live from the scene.

378
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,870
From the televised broadcast just now,

379
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,470
I've figured out the approximate positions of the seven people

380
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,370
right after the murder.

381
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,070
But, this isn't enough.

382
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,370
What's the spelling for Hercule Poirot?

383
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,570
What?

384
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,970
Hey, what're you doing?

385
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,970
Did you drink the Paikal like I told you to?

386
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,470
Yes, I did.

387
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,670
I don't know what you're trying to do,

388
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,470
but I'm feeling as bad as ever.

389
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,870
Give me the spelling for Poirot.

390
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,870
It's H. E. R. C. U. L. E. P. O. I. R. O. T.

391
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,970
Why do you want to know?

392
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,670
I'm trying to download the data of that drug

393
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,870
from this computer to Dr. Agasa's MO,

394
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,970
but it requires a password.

395
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,570
R.O.T.

396
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,870
"Wrong password"

397
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,470
No good. I can't open it with Poirot either.

398
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,370
What do you mean the password is Poirot?

399
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,770
The people of the organization

400
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,670
were calling the drug by this name

401
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,270
Changing serial number 4869 was coded Sherlock.

402
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,370
For an inefficient detective,

403
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,470
That's why I'm entering all the detective names

404
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,470
that I can think of one after the other.

405
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,870
I guess it's not all that easy.

406
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,770
Shelling Ford.

407
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,570
It's spelled, S. H. E. L. L. I. N. G. F. O. R. D.

408
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,270
Was there a detective by that name?

409
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,570
Never mind that, just enter it!

410
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,070
S. H. E. L. L. I. N. G. F. O. R. D.

411
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,670
It opened. Why?

412
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,870
The name Shelling Ford

413
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,770
is the temporary name that Conan Doyle

414
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,570
named the detective of his novel

415
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,570
before the detective was renamed Sherlock.

416
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,970
In other words, this detective was in his trial stage!

417
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,670
Oh. It's a pretty fancy thing for the organization to do.

418
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,270
We don't have much time left.

419
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,370
How're you doing?

420
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,370
Of course I'm doing terrible

421
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,470
after drinking that liquor.

422
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,170
I'm going to download the data of the drug into the MO,

423
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,370
and hide it here,

424
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,170
so come get it later, okay?

425
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,270
After they come to get me.

426
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,070
Hey.

427
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,070
Shinichi, in front there.

428
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,670
It's them.

429
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,570
Don't tell me they've come for Pisco.

430
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,470
No, no way!

431
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,470
Before the seven people are released,

432
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,970
the Inspector is supposed to call me.

433
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,370
Don't tell me that a transmitter was built in

434
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,370
to the computer that Haibara is using right now.

435
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,070
I see, since they couldn't get through by phone,

436
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,070
they followed the transmitter.

437
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,570
Haibara, big trouble!

438
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,770
They're coming!

439
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,470
Hide in the fireplace or something for now.

440
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,570
Hey, what's up?

441
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,670
Hey!

442
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,670
Inspector! It's Kudo!

443
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,870
What? Black organization?

444
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,480
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,200
"Fluorescent paint"

446
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,860
There is going to be a great turn of events in the next episode!

447
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,420
We should never drink too much

448
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,200
when we're not feeling good.
