1
00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:05,985
Hey, Ran.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,391
Ran?

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,591
Hey!

4
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:11,991
The tea's over flowing.

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:19,591
That glasses brat seems to have caught a cold.

6
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,891
Huh?

7
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:24,491
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,791
You must be true to yourself.

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,007
It's been a long time since they last saw each other.

10
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:30,491
So, the atmosphere between Ran and Shinichi is strangely awkward.

11
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:32,011
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,013
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:36,291
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,705
What lay waiting for us when we arrived in London

15
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,905
was a coded memo of what looked to be a forewarning

16
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:25,905
of a massacre that was about to happen.

17
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:31,005
Ran calls Shinichi to get help on deciphering the code.

18
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:32,131
But during the conversation,

19
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,133
I realized that the first sentence of the coded note

20
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:38,137
was referring to the famous clock tower, Big Ben,

21
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:41,805
and carelessly told her what I realized, in Shinichi's voice.

22
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:46,145
Since Ran firmly believed that Shinichi is also in London,

23
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,705
she persistently pursues me,

24
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:49,305
so I had no choice but to...

25
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:59,305
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Satan)"

26
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,805
From right about after he got the call from Ran last night,

27
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:05,205
he suddenly started shaking...

28
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:10,169
Since he ran around the city of London all sweaty,

29
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,805
then got cold in the night wind,

30
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:13,305
maybe he caught a cold.

31
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,505
Oh boy. I mean we're going to be

32
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:17,905
leaving for Japan tomorrow night already, and then...

33
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,805
Well, he drank his medicine

34
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:22,181
and his fever is coming down, too.

35
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,505
So if he sleeps a day, he'll be fine!

36
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,185
So...

37
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,187
Don't worry about me.

38
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:32,705
Ran and Pops, please decipher that code!

39
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,505
The seven sentences in that coded memo

40
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:40,199
is each probably some building somewhere or a place!

41
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,201
How do you know?

42
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:46,605
Shinichi told me so.

43
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:48,207
Shinichi did...

44
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:53,505
By the way, Shinichi was saying in front of Big Ben

45
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:56,905
that the first line that goes, "The loud ringing of the bell",

46
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,705
means the chime of Big Ben.

47
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,705
In front of Big Ben...

48
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:04,223
You mean that detective kid is here in London?

49
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,205
I mean, you knew about it, eh?

50
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,805
If I knew, I wouldn't have made a gift list!

51
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:15,205
At any rate, just leave Conan to me.

52
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:19,905
Ran and Kogoro, go ahead and decipher the code, all right?

53
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:26,805
We somehow managed to get through.

54
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,905
But I didn't think you'd go as far as to drink the antidote

55
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,705
you were supposed to use for returning to Japan.

56
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,905
I couldn't help it, could I?

57
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:36,005
If I didn't drink it, the fact that the boy Conan Edogawa

58
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:41,205
is the childhood form of Shinichi Kudo would've been exposed, right?

59
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,205
How do you intend to get back home?

60
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,605
There is no more drug left, you know!

61
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,905
I can't have Ai bring it over to me either.

62
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:51,005
Well, I guess I'll stay cooped up in my room

63
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,705
and think of something.

64
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,105
Huh? You're not going out?

65
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:57,005
You were planning to meet with Ran and the others

66
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,805
to decipher the code, weren't you?

67
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,305
You gotta be kidding!

68
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,505
How can I risk walking outside

69
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:03,105
when I don't have the slightest idea

70
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,305
when my body will turn into Conan again!

71
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:10,005
Beside, I really can't face up to her right now.

72
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:12,805
More important, look at this.

73
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:15,105
-This morning's paper. -Huh?

74
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,295
From the fingerprints that were detected

75
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,705
on the piece of paper with the code written on it,

76
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:21,605
they seemed to have come up with a suspect!

77
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,705
His name is Hades Sabara.

78
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:25,805
He's a serial killer on the run!

79
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:30,105
First, we've got to investigate on this guy.

80
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,905
But, if they've come up with a culprit,

81
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:34,313
I'm sure he'll soon be arrested.

82
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,005
Come on!

83
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:39,505
This guy deliberately left his fingerprints behind, you know?

84
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,005
Which means he's planning to do something,

85
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:43,205
despite risking being arrested!

86
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:48,327
If you say that the loud ringing bell is Big Ben,

87
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,972
it's quite convincing.

88
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:54,333
But there can't possibly be buildings

89
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,335
that look like eggs or pickles.

90
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:58,337
-Excuse me! -Yes?

91
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:03,672
Is there an egg-shaped building here in London?

92
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:07,472
Oh yes, there's a city hall near the Tower Bridge.

93
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:08,972
It's there!

94
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:14,072
"London City Hall"

95
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,172
It's unbelievable that

96
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,772
there would be a building shaped like this.

97
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:20,072
Then, for the 3rd sentence that goes...

98
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:22,361
"Fill an empty stomach on a boiled egg

99
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,363
as cold as a corpse" would mean...

100
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,365
this City Hall here!

101
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,672
What are these words? A code?

102
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,672
Do they mean a name?

103
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:36,375
The doll's name is Mazarin Stone!

104
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,377
Mazarin Stone...

105
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,379
Mazarin Stone!

106
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,372
Hi!

107
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:44,383
How did you get the doll?

108
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:48,387
The doll? I found it there beside the bench,

109
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,389
under the shrubs.

110
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:52,772
Can I see that?

111
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,672
You can keep it!

112
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:57,472
I've got plenty already!

113
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,372
-Goodbye! -Goodbye!

114
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,172
What's that?

115
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,472
It may have something to do with the code!

116
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:06,672
You see,

117
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:10,172
the culprit who was passing out the paper with the code

118
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:14,413
said, "If you can't solve it, ask Holmes", right?

119
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,672
If so, he may have scattered things

120
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,472
that have to do with Holmes near the places

121
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,421
indicated by the code, don't you think?

122
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,072
Shinichi told me some time ago,

123
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:29,072
that "Mazarin Stone" is the titles of one of Holmes' story.

124
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:33,772
Hey, I went out of my way to make you lunch,

125
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:36,172
but you haven't touched it at all!

126
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:39,372
Sorry, I was just checking on a case

127
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,672
that Inspector Megure told me to investigate.

128
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,572
Geez!

129
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,072
Getting carried away making deductions

130
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:47,972
to point of forgetting that you're hungry.

131
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:50,472
You're going to starve to death one day!

132
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:54,772
In a story called Mazarin Stone, Holmes said,

133
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:59,772
"The brain works better on an empty stomach!"

134
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,172
Holmes again?

135
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:05,772
"I'm all brains, Watson."

136
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:09,472
"The rest is just a continuation of add-on sentences!"

137
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:14,172
If only the top part of the sentences is important...

138
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:18,477
The head part is what is important.

139
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,172
Hey, just what're you doing?

140
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:24,483
Huh? Something's written!

141
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,872
What?

142
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,272
T.

143
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,772
T?

144
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,489
I get it!

145
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:33,972
Some alphabets are hidden in the places indicated by the code,

146
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,072
and if connected the alphabets,

147
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:38,497
probably form words. What do you think?

148
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:42,501
But after the "egg" is the "pickle", right?

149
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,272
A thin, flat building that looks like a pickle

150
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:48,172
couldn't possibly exist.

151
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:52,511
But the code said "Bite on the whole pickle."

152
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,872
So, it must be pickles before they are sliced.

153
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,515
Don't be silly!

154
00:08:56,515 --> 00:09:00,872
Pickles are young cucumbers immersed in vinegar, you know!

155
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,972
There's no way that such a long, narrow, round building

156
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:05,872
could exist in this world, you see...

157
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:14,533
That must be the one!

158
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,872
No way!

159
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:20,539
This Hades Sabara guy is really dangerous.

160
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,972
He seems to have started off as a serious office worker

161
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,972
but after his mother fell ill, of a rare disease,

162
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,972
he went out and borrowed money from his acquaintances

163
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,549
to gather funds for his mother's surgery.

164
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
Then he invested the money into stocks and bookies,

165
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,553
but lost everything.

166
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:37,272
Because of this, his mother couldn't undergo surgery,

167
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,672
and she passed away last year in July.

168
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:43,772
He slaughtered one man after the other,

169
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:45,672
not only his acquaintances

170
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,572
who kept hounding him for collection,

171
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:52,072
but also the people who suggested that he invest in stocks.

172
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:54,272
On top of that, he blew up the hospitals

173
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:57,272
that refused to perform surgery on his mother one after the other,

174
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,872
which resulted in a large number of casualties.

175
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:01,672
Blew up...

176
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:03,472
You mean he uses bombs, too?

177
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,583
Yeah.

178
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,872
While Hades was on the run,

179
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,587
he ran into a woman named Hestia,

180
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,972
a military outcast and expert on explosives.

181
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:14,593
She helped Hades carry out his revenge!

182
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,572
As for that woman,

183
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:21,072
it says that she blew herself up

184
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:23,572
when the police found her at her hide-out.

185
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,872
But since her body seems to have blown to pieces...

186
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,872
You mean the body that turned up was of someone else,

187
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:30,609
and that she is still alive?

188
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,772
Yeah.

189
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:34,613
But why is it that such a vicious criminal

190
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:36,972
still remains on the loose?

191
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,617
It seems that he's gone through

192
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,272
repeated plastic surgeries while on the run.

193
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:44,623
Well, with this guy, you can never tell what he'll do.

194
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,625
After all, he may have a grudge

195
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:48,627
against the entire country of Great Britain

196
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:52,631
which allows bookies to prey on anybody, in every way possible.

197
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,172
It's from Ran.

198
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:04,372
Sorry. Answer it for me, will you?

199
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,372
Huh? It'll be strange if I answer that phone!

200
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:10,672
I mean, hurry up and answer it!

201
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:14,372
She could've come up with something concerning the code!

202
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:15,772
True.

203
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,072
-Hello? -If you're there,

204
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,172
hurry up and answer the phone, stupid!

205
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:24,663
That's Ran's cell phone, isn't it?

206
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,672
Ran's all blushed and couldn't work up the courage to call you,

207
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:30,669
so I've decided to personally call you myself!

208
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,672
I mean, she also says that there's no one other than you

209
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,172
who knows about Sherlock Holmes the most!

210
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,675
About Holmes?

211
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:39,772
Yeah! The "egg" in the 3rd line

212
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:42,272
refers to the egg-shaped City Hall.

213
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,172
The "pickle" in the 4th line refers to

214
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,972
a building called the Gherkins

215
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,672
that is shaped like a young cucumber.

216
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,572
We've figured this out.

217
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:53,672
But the problem is, things having to do with Holmes

218
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,172
are scattered near all these places.

219
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,695
Like, what kind of things?

220
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,772
A doll was found by the City Hall, and on its chest...

221
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:02,701
A something Stone was written...

222
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,972
Mazarin Stone was written!

223
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,707
Since you once mentioned that

224
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,372
there was a scene in that story where Holmes said

225
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,711
"all the sentences except the top part are add-ons",

226
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,272
that's why I...

227
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:16,172
I pulled the head of the doll off

228
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:19,072
and found the letter "T"!

229
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,719
I see.

230
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,472
Taking into consideration Holmes' dialogues

231
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:24,723
that are in the story of that title...

232
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,272
they lead to key words that provide hints to solving the case.

233
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:31,772
Yep! I found a lot of strange scratched up pens on the ground,

234
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:34,733
near the building called the Gherkin too.

235
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,872
The words "Dancing Men" are written on the barrel of the pen.

236
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:40,739
This is the title of another one of Holmes' story, isn't it?

237
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,772
Yeah. Dancing men.

238
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:46,745
So, I thought there may be something hidden here too

239
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,672
and took off the caps on the top and bottom part,

240
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:51,472
but found nothing.

241
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,372
Then, take the caps of the top and bottom

242
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,172
and try matching the two up!

243
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:58,772
The scratches will most likely match up in a certain place.

244
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,672
I found it! It's the letter N!

245
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:05,872
But, how did you know?

246
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:09,372
He said so in the story!

247
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,272
"Get rid of all the deductions part way,

248
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:15,972
and indicate only the starting point and the conclusion.

249
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:17,572
Though it may seem meretricious,

250
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,772
it will have a sufficiently surprising effect!"

251
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:24,783
I see! That's why the barrel in the middle

252
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,772
had to be taken away before matching top and bottom caps together!

253
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:30,172
Then, maybe there's something near Big Ben

254
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,272
that was mentioned in the beginning too?

255
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,872
I thought so too and came here,

256
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:38,472
but I can't find anything.

257
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,799
There's a strange arrow drawn on the road

258
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:44,572
in front of the gate of Big Ben that dad found, but...

259
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:46,572
-An arrow? -Yep.

260
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,472
You know that there's a bridge right beside Big Ben, right?

261
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,672
It seems to be pointing in that direction.

262
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,472
I get it!

263
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,072
Part way across the bridge

264
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,572
beside the drain with the lid removed,

265
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,472
there was something written.

266
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,172
The Valley of Fear.

267
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,672
It's The Valley of Fear!

268
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:10,072
I found it! I found it, Shinichi!

269
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:12,831
Where is the keyword hidden?

270
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
The Valley of Fear...

271
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,835
It was a long story.

272
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,772
I wonder if any bridge came out in that story?

273
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,572
No, it doesn't necessarily have to be a bridge.

274
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:26,472
A drain... river... water...

275
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:27,672
Water?

276
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:30,072
Don't you see anything in the river?

277
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:31,372
Huh?

278
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,872
"If something heavy is gone near the water,

279
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:39,572
there's no doubt that something was sunk into the water."

280
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,672
This is Holmes' dialogue.

281
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,272
That's why I think that there's something sunk into the Thames.

282
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,869
On the lamppost that is on the railing of the bridge...

283
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,672
There is a thin rope tied on,

284
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,372
and the tip of the rope is sunk into the river!

285
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,272
It's the alphabet "A"! "A" is carved on it!

286
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,472
So, the letters you found are T, N, and A.

287
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:12,891
Hey, Shinichi.

288
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:17,372
I think the next place is going to be something like a cake,

289
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:19,472
but where should I go?

290
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,901
Talking on the phone is getting us nowhere!

291
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,472
You wait there, because I'll be right over!

292
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:35,941
The phone will do just fine.

293
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:38,917
You see, we somehow managed to find

294
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,919
the 3 keywords up to now, too.

295
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,941
Huh? If that detective kid is here in London,

296
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,441
wouldn't it be faster if we got together

297
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:48,927
and solved the code with him?

298
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:53,841
Or, do you have a reason for not wanting him to come?

299
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:55,341
No, it's nothing like that!

300
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,935
Oh?

301
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,941
You're the girl I ran into yesterday!

302
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,641
Minerva Grass!

303
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,741
Minerva Grass, that tennis player?

304
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,945
Is it alright for you to be walking around outside?

305
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,841
The finals for the ladies' single match is tomorrow, isn't it?

306
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:13,541
Yes. I'm taking a break from training right now.

307
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,441
Are you all right?

308
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,641
The thing that was bothering you last night.

309
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:20,941
Don't tell me that he's your boyfriend?

310
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:22,961
He's my father.

311
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,441
Besides, I'm more concerned over the code right now.

312
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:27,941
Code?

313
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,741
Then, it's the same as my younger brother Apollo!

314
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,741
My brother received a piece of paper from a strange man,

315
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,141
and seems to have given that paper with codes written on it

316
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,441
to a boy who claimed to be Holmes' disciple.

317
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,641
Holmes' disciple?

318
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,741
I think his name was Conan.

319
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:41,941
I see!

320
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:44,983
The Apollo that Conan was talking about was you!

321
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:47,841
Huh? Do you know him?

322
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,987
Yes.

323
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,241
But today's he's sleeping back at the hotel because of a cold.

324
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,741
Did you hear that? Shinichi!

325
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,841
I coincidentally ran into a boy named Apollo

326
00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:01,641
that gave the paper with the code on it to Conan.

327
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,001
Shinichi?

328
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,003
Sorry.

329
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:08,241
I've come up with an urgent matter,

330
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,541
and can't go over there.

331
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,011
Is that so?

332
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,541
Yeah. I just got mail from a client of another case

333
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,741
who says he's coming over to see me now.

334
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:22,241
Well, if it's urgent, it can't be helped.

335
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,041
Well, I'll be at the hotel,

336
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,241
so just call me anytime!

337
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,841
The one sending out the code

338
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,541
is a nefarious criminal called Hades Sabara,

339
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,441
we've got to decipher the code as soon as possible.

340
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:35,033
If that boy Apollo is with you,

341
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,541
have him go around with you!

342
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,037
Because I'm sure that he knows London more than you two do!

343
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,441
Okay, I got you!

344
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,341
You know what, Apollo!

345
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,541
Will you come along and help us decipher the code?

346
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,341
Yep! Okay!

347
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:50,441
I'll be at the hotel.

348
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:52,641
I've got a masseur coming.

349
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:55,641
Please take good care of him!

350
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,041
Sure thing!

351
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:02,141
But the next code is cake, isn't it?

352
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:05,641
Is there a building in London that's shaped like that?

353
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,065
Cake?

354
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,541
Yep, I know where it is!

355
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,641
-Huh? -Huh?

356
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,841
Wow! It really looks like a wedding cake!

357
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,841
Of course it looks just like one!

358
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,741
The wedding cake is said to have been designed

359
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:22,441
after the shape of this church!

360
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,541
Even the name is St. Bride Church.

361
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,841
It really sounds like a joke.

362
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,341
Apollo, I'm amazed you knew about it!

363
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:33,441
It's because big sis used to bring me here a lot.

364
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:36,141
She says that she going to get married to Ales

365
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:37,841
one day at this church.

366
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,441
Who's Ales?

367
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,441
Big sis' ex-coach!

368
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:45,641
Daddy used to be Ales' coach before though!

369
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,741
Your father died in a traffic accident.

370
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:52,541
Yep! On his way to watch Ales' match.

371
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,341
Big sis was at home that day with mother because of a cold,

372
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:59,641
and I was still in mother's stomach back then.

373
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,141
That's why I heard that Ales...

374
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,741
suddenly retired from being a player

375
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,041
and became big sis' coach!

376
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,127
Because it seems to have been daddy's dream

377
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,841
to make big sis a winner at the Wimbledon!

378
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:13,941
Then, his dream has been granted!

379
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,133
Yep!

380
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:21,641
But Ales still blames himself for the death of daddy.

381
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:24,141
So, he got into a fight with big sis

382
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,241
and quit being her coach.

383
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:29,141
I know that Ales likes big sis too, and yet...

384
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:31,541
He's bluffing being strong saying stuff like, "In Tennis, love is zero.

385
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,151
No matter how much you accumulate on zero,

386
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:37,155
all you get from it is defeat."

387
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,841
In tennis, love is zero.

388
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,741
I see. That's why she said what she did.

389
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,441
Then, you're troubled over love?

390
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:50,841
But I'm no longer troubled, though.

391
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,941
Love is zero.

392
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:55,941
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

393
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,941
the result is miserable defeat.

394
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,541
Rather, I completely forgot to tell her

395
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,441
what I was supposed to!

396
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:09,187
Who are you going to tell what to?

397
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,541
It's nothing.

398
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,941
Don't we have to look for it?

399
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:16,341
Somewhere in this church there is a hidden keyword

400
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,541
that has something to do with Holmes, right?

401
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,199
Right. We've got to look for it!

402
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,941
"A Scandal in Bohemia"

403
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:31,209
What?

404
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,541
You found paper on the ground around the church

405
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,641
that was shaped like a wedding cake?

406
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:38,241
And? What's written on the paper?

407
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:40,141
It's handwritten and reads...

408
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,221
"A Scandal in Bohemia."

409
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,641
A Scandal in Bohemia...

410
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:48,441
is the story that Irene Adler appears in.

411
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,441
And, is there anything besides the title

412
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,041
that is written on that paper

413
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,841
or is there something strange about it?

414
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:56,341
The color of the paper is light pink

415
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:59,541
and the words seem to be written in black ink.

416
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,241
There's nothing else strange about it.

417
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,741
The paper is thick and you can't see through it.

418
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,941
You can't tell because you're just looking at it

419
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,941
and not really scrutinizing it.

420
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:13,251
How rude! I am scrutinizing it!

421
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,241
No.

422
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,841
That's the dialogue that

423
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,641
Holmes said to Watson in that story.

424
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:19,941
There was a scene where Holmes

425
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,341
showed a letter of that color to Watson.

426
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,541
If I want to take a closer look at it,

427
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,841
I'll have to take it out of the plastic bag.

428
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,641
Huh? Is it in a plastic bag?

429
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:31,269
-Yep. -Then, take the paper out of the bag

430
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:33,041
and wet it with water!

431
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,341
The plastic bag is a hint that tells you to wet it!

432
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,541
The letters are fading because of the water.

433
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,541
Only the letter "S" is left clearly legible!

434
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,741
It seems that only the letter "S"

435
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,841
is written with an oil based pen.

436
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:55,293
Yeah! The paper is thick in order to hide this!

437
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:56,441
If the paper is thin,

438
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,641
only the letter that is written with an oil based pen will smear

439
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:01,299
and all the way to the back of the paper.

440
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,641
Which means...

441
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,641
that the keyword for the St. Bride Church

442
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,641
that is shaped like a cake is...

443
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:08,941
"S"!

444
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:11,309
The egg-shaped City Hall is...

445
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,641
"T"!

446
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:16,041
The pickle shaped building Gherkin is...

447
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,315
"N"!

448
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:20,241
And the loud ringing sound of Big Ben...

449
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,319
"A"!

450
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:25,041
In the coded sentences Big Ben comes out twice,

451
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,341
so I guess we can say that the letter "A" will appear twice.

452
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:32,641
Satan!

453
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,641
It's the devil.

454
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,220
"Saturn"

456
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,958
Shinichi, who's more important to you, me or Holmes?

457
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,100
Why, that's obvious. Of course it's...
