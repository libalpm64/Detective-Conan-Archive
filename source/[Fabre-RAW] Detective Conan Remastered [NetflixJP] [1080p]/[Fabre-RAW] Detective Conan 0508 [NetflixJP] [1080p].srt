1
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:04,443
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:05,985
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,987
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,343
High school girl Sonoko's deduction puts Kogoro to shame!

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,991
Solve the mystery of the missing weapon!

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,343
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:15,043
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:16,943
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,269
Eisuke Hondo who had been in the custody of the FBI

10
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,369
involving the case of Rena Mizunashi returns.

11
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,669
A suspicious man tails all of us who go to a karaoke shop

12
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,569
to celebrate Eisuke coming back to school.

13
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,669
Could he be a FBI agent who is watching and protecting Eisuke?

14
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,269
But that man is killed in a room of the karaoke shop.

15
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:26,125
The killer is among the customers who have come to the karaoke shop.

16
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,869
Don't tell me that Eisuke...

17
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,869
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop ( Part 2 )"

18
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,769
Then, let's start

19
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,669
-with Mr. Kunio Tamai who was in room number 1. -Yes.

20
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,669
"Kunio Tamai (63)" -I came here today

21
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:54,669
on my way home from fishing.

22
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:58,569
Oh, you came to this karaoke shop alone after fishing?

23
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,469
Is anything wrong with that?

24
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,969
You've fished quite a lot of fish.

25
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,669
To be honest, I bought most of the fish at the supermarket.

26
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,469
I was careless and my fishing rod drifted away.

27
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,669
But I promised my family that I would fish a lot of fish.

28
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,969
So having no other choice I went to buy the fish.

29
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:32,969
It's true there's no fishing rod in the case.

30
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:35,969
If I get home too early, my family would get suspicious,

31
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,769
so I decided to kill some time here.

32
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:44,669
Next, Mr. Kyota Honma who was using room number 2.

33
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:45,869
Yes.

34
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,469
"Kyoto Honma (32)" -I have a company karaoke contest

35
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,569
coming up soon, so I was practicing here.

36
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,769
Is your company near here?

37
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:54,869
No,

38
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,669
I'd be embarrassed if any of my colleagues found out.

39
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,669
So, I came all this way to a shop that's some distance away.

40
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:07,969
Do you buy cigarettes by the carton?

41
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,769
Yes, because I'm a heavy smoker.

42
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,869
Excuse me, I will need to check it.

43
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:22,569
Well, cigarettes cannot be used as a blunt weapon.

44
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,669
Oh, stopping by at a karaoke shop after school.

45
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,669
"Eisuke Hondo (17)" -Yes.

46
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,251
I tell you, young people nowadays.

47
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:39,869
Oh, a maracas!

48
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,769
I like this instrument!

49
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,369
The maracas can't be used either.

50
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:51,069
"Konji Arimoto (34)" -Next, Mr. Konji Arimoto of room 4.

51
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,769
I came here to sing karaoke with her after going to the gym.

52
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,569
No problem, is there?

53
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,869
Huh?

54
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:01,069
This is the new sparkling drink

55
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,969
that was introduced the other day, isn't it?

56
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,169
Yeah, I bought it because she wanted to try.

57
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,289
It was so junk that she only took a sip though.

58
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:15,569
A PET bottle can't kill either.

59
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,769
"Keep Out, Police Line"

60
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,069
We tried going around everyone's room

61
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,269
but there's no sign of the murder weapon.

62
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:29,269
True, I also checked the restrooms.

63
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,369
That's impossible.

64
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:35,069
I'm sure it's somewhere in this karaoke shop,

65
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,317
the blunt object that was used as the murder weapon.

66
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,269
Besides, I also want to confirm

67
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,969
if that man who was killed is a FBI agent.

68
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,569
The number you have called

69
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:48,327
cannot be reached because it is outside the service area

70
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,329
or switched off...

71
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,669
Why can't I get through to Ms. Jody?

72
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,169
Inspector!

73
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,337
The film that the victim had on him has been developed just now,

74
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,669
and we found out something unexpected.

75
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,669
Something unexpected?

76
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,069
Hey, what's this?

77
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,669
It's the picture of us! Gross.

78
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,469
Don't tell me he was a stalker?

79
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:14,069
I'm sure that's what he was. Yuck!

80
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,569
I guess this incident has nothing to do with us, then.

81
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,769
I guess not.

82
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,069
I've never seen the face of the victim either.

83
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:26,365
Are you saying that you all never even passed by him in the corridor?

84
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:27,769
No, we don't.

85
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:28,769
If we were to see the victim,

86
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,769
it would either be in the corridor or the men's room.

87
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:34,373
But I didn't see the face of anybody besides all those here.

88
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,375
As for me, I haven't seen any other customers

89
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,169
until this incident occurred.

90
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,869
Well, normal thinking would lead us to think

91
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,385
that the boy with the round glasses is the killer, no?

92
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,769
Right.

93
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,669
He probably killed the man because he was being stalked everywhere.

94
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,269
No.

95
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:00,069
Hey, take a good look.

96
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,969
I'm in the center of all of them.

97
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,569
I'm the one he was after.

98
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:08,407
It's not this glasses boy klutz he was after!

99
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,969
Oh, boy.

100
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,415
Officer, I think it's about time you let us go!

101
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,169
Right, officer!

102
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,169
It's true that Sonoko's in the middle of this picture too.

103
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,469
Then maybe the man who was killed wasn't a FBI agent, but...

104
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:29,369
Oh, wait a sec.

105
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,269
If I remember correctly...

106
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:33,969
It's already 7:30p.m.!

107
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,369
No, I can't let you go yet.

108
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:42,441
I don't mind staying here until all your doubts about me are cleared.

109
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,069
Please do so.

110
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,445
I just happen to have playing cards on me,

111
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:51,069
I'll be playing Poker or Black Jack with her and kill time.

112
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,453
Black Jack!

113
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,455
So, that trick could be used.

114
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,369
At any rate,

115
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,269
taking into consideration Mr. Moniwa's estimated time of death

116
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,269
who was killed in room number 5 of this karaoke shop,

117
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,669
the murder was committed between 18:00 to 18:20,

118
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,069
during a span of 30 minutes.

119
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,069
According to the surveillance camera,

120
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:23,869
the people who went in the direction of the victim's room are...

121
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,489
Mr. Kyota Honma, who left room number 2 at 17:50.

122
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:35,669
Mr. Eisuke Hondo, who left room number 3 at 18:03.

123
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,769
Mr. Konji Arimoto, who left room number 4 at 18:05.

124
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:46,069
And, Mr. Kunio Tamai, who left room number 1 at 18:07.

125
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:50,509
I'm certain that the killer is among you four.

126
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,969
I can't let you go yet.

127
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,769
But, the murder weapon is nowhere, right?

128
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,969
If I remember correctly, you mentioned it was some blunt object, right?

129
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:03,869
He did, I don't think he has the right to keep us here

130
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,869
because the murder weapon isn't found.

131
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:12,531
The murder weapon is here.

132
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,869
It's something that's unthinkable of being a murder weapon, though.

133
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,969
Sonoko! Your usual "thing" has come!

134
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:24,543
Oh, no. That wasn't me just now...

135
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,369
Just now?

136
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,869
Yes, I thought that

137
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,269
it doesn't have to be me to solve this simple case,

138
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,969
but I'll tell you why it's hard to find the murder weapon.

139
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:48,567
The trick involves the murder weapon changing shape

140
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,269
after the murder was committed

141
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,769
and disappearing, together with the killer who used it.

142
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:05,921
Yeah, if it's okay with you, please tell us how it was done, miss.

143
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,321
Hold it!

144
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,221
You're saying that it was a blunt object when the murder was committed,

145
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,591
but is gone now, right?

146
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:13,821
Yes.

147
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,321
I got it, then.

148
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,321
The murder weapon was probably a huge clump of ice!

149
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,601
And the murder had a cooler box

150
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,021
that he could keep the ice in for a long period of time.

151
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:28,321
Mr. Kunio Tamai. It's you!

152
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:29,921
What?

153
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,021
Too bad. Wrong.

154
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,021
It's true that if ice were used to strike the victim's head,

155
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:37,721
after the murder is committed, it would melt and disappear.

156
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,321
But if it were used,

157
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:42,621
shattered pieces of ice and drops of water would splatter,

158
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:45,321
and smears made by water should've been found.

159
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:48,221
No such smears were found anywhere.

160
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:51,321
And, judging from the splattered blood of the victim,

161
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,421
left as is, there is no trace of the killer having wiped the floor

162
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:55,321
after committing the murder.

163
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,721
The murderer put that hard something inside something and struck the victim,

164
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,641
after making sure that it wouldn't scatter.

165
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:04,921
I see, a PET bottle!

166
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,721
If the content is frozen stiff,

167
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:09,721
water wouldn't splatter as much!

168
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,649
In other words,

169
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,321
the culprit would be the one who had the PET bottle

170
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:15,121
with a sparkling drink in it,

171
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,221
in other words, you, Mr. Arimoto,

172
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:19,821
No, wrong!

173
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:23,221
Mr. Akimoto left the room at a little after 18:00.

174
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:27,521
Inspector, you checked the PET bottle at 19:30.

175
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,221
In an air conditioned room like this,

176
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,121
ice inside a 500 ml bottle

177
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:35,321
will not melt completely in an hour and a half.

178
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,121
Then, what is the hard thing that you're talking about?

179
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:43,821
Oh, I think you have some too, Inspector.

180
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,021
What?

181
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:49,621
Yes, it's an essential item that everyone has.

182
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,421
Coins, loose change!

183
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:54,693
And most probably ten yen coins!

184
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,921
-Ten... -Ten yen coin?

185
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:02,321
Miss, just how can somebody strike a person with a ten yen coin?

186
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,721
You are right, with just one ten yen coin,

187
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,421
the most a person can do is wound someone.

188
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,321
But with 300 coins,

189
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:14,121
it'll turn into a blunt object weighing 1.5 kilograms.

190
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,021
Although that's true, but...

191
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:19,421
Nobody had that many coins on them.

192
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,221
The person got rid of it after committing the murder.

193
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,021
Got rid of it?

194
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:27,321
By putting it into the machine behind you, Inspector.

195
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:33,021
-I see! -The cigarette vending machine!

196
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:36,221
In other words, 300 ten yen coins were put inside the PET bottle

197
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,221
and used as a murder weapon to beat the victim to death!

198
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:43,021
Then, later the coins were inserted into the vending machine and used.

199
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,743
No, no, no!

200
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,221
The mouth of the bottle of the sparkling drink is too small

201
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,521
to insert a ten yen coin.

202
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,621
Besides, if something like that were put inside the PET bottle,

203
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,753
it would be damaged from the inside and outside.

204
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,521
One look and it would be obvious.

205
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:59,321
But, what on earth were the coins put inside then?

206
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,221
Yes, just like the ten yen coin,

207
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,221
it's an essential item that everyone uses,

208
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:07,821
Moreover, if a lot of ten yen coins are stuffed inside it,

209
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,321
it turns into a weapon commonly called Black Jack.

210
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,771
A sock!

211
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,021
A sock?

212
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,121
Isn't that right,

213
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,777
Mr. Kyota Honma?

214
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:24,221
Why is it him?

215
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,785
Both Mr. Tamai and Eisuke are wearing socks, too.

216
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,789
Mr. Honma's shoes are tightly fitted, see?

217
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,521
Excuse me.

218
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:40,799
True.

219
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,803
When he came into our room once by mistake,

220
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,321
he bumped into Mr. Arimoto and fell,

221
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:51,221
but back then his shoe was not tight, so it came off.

222
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,321
Now, he's wearing the sock that he used

223
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,621
for the murder weapon over another sock.

224
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:58,821
He probably wanted to hide the victim's blood

225
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:02,221
that splattered on his sock when committing the murder.

226
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:06,221
Come to think of it, Mr. Honma had a carton of cigarettes.

227
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,827
If he has the wrapping paper of the carton beforehand,

228
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,521
after getting rid of the ten yen coins

229
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:13,821
that were used to commit the murder with the vending machine,

230
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,221
even if a lot of cigarettes come out,

231
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,421
he could put in the wrapping paper and get away with it.

232
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:21,221
If you check the vending machine for a large amount of ten yen coins,

233
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,121
that's conclusive evidence.

234
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,121
If blood is on his sock,

235
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:28,621
blood should also be found on the 10 yen coins inside.

236
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:32,021
I'm sure his fingerprints are on them, too.

237
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,921
I don't think the culprit who wanted to use up

238
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,121
all the ten yen coins as soon as possible and leave the scene,

239
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,857
would bother to use gloves.

240
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:43,521
Then, you lied when you said that you've never seen the victim?

241
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:45,421
Never seen him, my foot.

242
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,721
I'll bet you know him very well, isn't it?

243
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,867
What?

244
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,121
The victim's name is Tatsumi.

245
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,621
Just by the sound of the name

246
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:54,873
it's hard to tell whether the victim is a he or a she.

247
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:56,875
However, Mr. Honma mentioned that

248
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,877
if he were to see the victim,

249
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,221
it would be in the corridor or the men's room.

250
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:05,921
Didn't he say this because he knew the man already?

251
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:08,221
He would never run into a woman in the restroom

252
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:11,621
because the men's room and the ladies' room are separated.

253
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:21,821
Yeah, I knew him.

254
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,421
I'd never forget

255
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:26,905
that man's face!

256
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,521
I'll never forget that kidnapper's face!

257
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,121
Kidnapper?

258
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,421
Yeah.

259
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:37,221
That guy kidnapped my son,

260
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:41,321
and after learning that I reported it to the police...

261
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,927
he killed my son, who was only 4 years old,

262
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:50,929
just to get back at me.

263
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,321
Daddy!

264
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,021
Oh, no...

265
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,621
Officer,

266
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:02,221
do you remember the kidnapping case

267
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:04,621
that occurred in Okubocho, a year ago?

268
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:08,521
Yeah, I heard that the suspect was caught

269
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:11,321
but that he was acquitted due to insufficient evidence.

270
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:14,953
Right, the murder weapon wasn't found.

271
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:19,521
It seems that guy used the same trick I used too, though.

272
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,621
That's why you've been following him waiting for a chance

273
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,221
to find a place that would meet the condition for carrying out the trick.

274
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:28,967
In other words, you decided to carry out your revenge at this karaoke shop

275
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,969
that has individual rooms and a cigarette vending machine.

276
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,321
Yeah.

277
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,977
Well, I hope you're grateful.

278
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,521
Judging from the picture he had on him,

279
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:44,721
the next targets might've been you people.

280
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,621
Well, if my son were as cautious as you,

281
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:50,989
he wouldn't have been kidnapped in the first place.

282
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,991
By the same token, a parent who would do something so stupid like this

283
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,821
may not have existed either.

284
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,221
Some welcome back celebration it turned out to be.

285
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:08,421
But, I was really overwhelmed with emotion.

286
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:11,009
Your deduction show, Sonoko.

287
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,421
You were just like the Sleeping Kogoro!

288
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:14,421
Yeah...

289
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,021
Your deduction was just as good as if not better than Shinichi's.

290
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,121
Really?

291
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,621
I don't remember a thing.

292
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:25,321
Shinichi? You mean that high school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

293
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:28,621
Right. He also Ran's "working away from home" husband.

294
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,221
Sonoko!

295
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:32,321
You're high school students and married?

296
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,921
Of course we're not married.

297
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,033
Why would I marry a guy like that?

298
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,821
He says he's busy with a case

299
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,721
and is out on a long business trip, you see!

300
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:42,521
They're like a long separated couple.

301
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,043
No. In fact, I'm living with her.

302
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,821
Oh, I've got some other books I want to buy,

303
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:51,049
-so you can go ahead home. -What? Now?

304
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,321
Don't worry, I'll stay with him

305
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,021
and make sure to bring him back to the detective agency.

306
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:57,721
Okay.

307
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:07,821
So? What is it?

308
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,121
You went out of your way to stay with me.

309
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,821
So, you must want to talk to me, right?

310
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:14,621
Yeah, I was thinking about it,

311
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:17,821
but I've decided to go to the States.

312
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:21,079
Did you decide to accept the witness protection program?

313
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,821
No, I refused.

314
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:27,085
Like I told you before, I don't like being tied down.

315
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,621
I seem to be lucky so far that the guys of the bad organization

316
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:33,091
haven't found me yet, either.

317
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,093
Then, why are you leaving for the States?

318
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,521
In order to join the CIA like my father and older sister did!

319
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:42,421
I'm going to reveal their evil doings from corner to corner

320
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,103
and eventually bust the entire Organization together with big sis.

321
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,421
First, you've got to do something about your clumsiness,

322
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,421
or you're not going to make it as a CIA agent.

323
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,021
Yeah.

324
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,921
Besides, the CIA is an organization

325
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:00,821
that works for the national benefit of the US.

326
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:03,121
I wonder if he knows that?

327
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:06,921
But, if you decided on leaving,

328
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:09,121
why did you come back to school?

329
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,721
Although it was just for a short while,

330
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:14,121
I wanted to meet the friends I made here once more before going.

331
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:17,121
I wanted to confess to Ran that.

332
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,921
I fell in love at first sight with her.

333
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:27,721
I've never seen anyone so pretty and kind like her, you see.

334
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:31,149
But, she seems to like Shinichi,

335
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:35,153
although I don't know how he feels about her.

336
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:39,421
Oh, right. Do you know how to get in touch with Shinichi?

337
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,721
Yeah.

338
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,921
Then, will you ask him for me

339
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:46,721
whether it's okay to tell Ran how I feel about her?

340
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,821
I won't be like Shinichi

341
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:54,421
and leave Ran to fend for herself.

342
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:56,421
And also that I'm planning to take her to the States with me in the future

343
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:59,177
and live happily ever after.

344
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,121
You can't.

345
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:07,185
No, I'm not asking for your opinion, ask Shinichi for me.

346
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,821
That's why I'm telling you it won't work!

347
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:21,221
Then... Then, don't tell me that you're...

348
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,621
Yeah, I'm exactly who you think I am.

349
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:38,521
So, the mystery's been solved!

350
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:41,821
I went to the Mouri Detective Agency to begin with

351
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:44,221
because I heard that he had seen Rena Mizunashi

352
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:46,021
just before she disappeared.

353
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:48,221
Back then, I didn't know that she was my older sister

354
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:50,921
as well as a member of the CIA.

355
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:54,121
Therefore, I thought that Detective Mouri conspired with bad people

356
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:57,235
sheltering her somewhere.

357
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:02,021
That's why I was checking up on Detective Mouri on my own.

358
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,321
Then, I found something out.

359
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:07,921
Detective Mouri's deduction before he becomes the Sleeping Kogoro

360
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:11,249
and after he becomes it, is totally different.

361
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:15,621
Moreover, you're always somewhere near the Sleeping Kogoro.

362
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:18,921
I tried not to think of why you've shrunk,

363
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:22,421
but just as I thought you're Shinichi Kudo, aren't you?

364
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,021
What do you mean "just as I thought"?

365
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:26,121
You sound like you already know about everything.

366
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:28,521
Yes, I assumed things to be this way.

367
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,621
From the time the Sleeping Kogoro appeared,

368
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,521
you were absent from school.

369
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,721
And, there was just one time that I fell deliberately

370
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:38,021
and not because I was a klutz.

371
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:41,821
Do you remember what I said when I saw you for the first time?

372
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,283
Nice to meet you, Detective Mouri.

373
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,285
I'm honoured to see you.

374
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:50,921
Then, you did all this just so that you could get the truth out of me?

375
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:55,293
Oh, but it's true that I fell in love at first sight with Ran.

376
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,621
Make sure you make her happy.

377
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,421
Oh, right. Do you know?

378
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:31,721
Something seems to have happened at the FBI.

379
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,921
What do you mean?

380
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:38,721
It looked like someone passed away.

381
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,121
But, if you haven't heard anything,

382
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,403
I guess everything's okay.

383
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:56,721
Yeah, everything's okay.

384
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,423
"Diary"

386
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,850
Next expisode is red, white and yellow.

387
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,088
You mean tulips?

388
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:10,720
-The sports festival! -A bean-paste bun?
