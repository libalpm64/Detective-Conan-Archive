1
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,566
In order to confirm whether Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke's older sister

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,966
are one and the same person,

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,866
we go and visit the Okudaira residence

4
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:11,566
where his mother used to work as a housekeeper.

5
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:13,066
We get hold of Eisuke's mother's belongings,

6
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,566
including a mother-child booklet.

7
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,266
From these things and Mrs. Okudaira,

8
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,866
we find out that Rena and Eisuke's older sister

9
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,866
are two different people.

10
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,966
In the meantime, at the Okudaira residence,

11
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,666
a year ago, the oldest son of this family, Tango

12
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,166
had been killed by someone

13
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,866
and a year later today,

14
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:32,366
the head of this household, Kakuzo is also found dead.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,066
At his feet, a blood smeared book with the title,

16
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,017
"Murderer from the Land of the Dead" is found.

17
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:43,366
At any rate, if this is a dying message,

18
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,366
your husband Kakuzo

19
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:56,566
had to have been killed by one of you in this house.

20
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,266
Sizzling hot suspense.

21
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,766
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

22
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,666
The case is finally solved!

23
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,063
Who is the murderer from the Land of the Dead?

24
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,266
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,966
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,166
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:57,284 --> 00:03:03,184
"Red and Black Crash: Hades"

28
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:07,084
I guess I'll start by asking you some questions!

29
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:09,284
Before he was found,

30
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:12,784
where was your husband and what was he doing?

31
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,484
Oh, yes.

32
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:17,484
I showed Detective Mouri to the living room,

33
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,084
and after that...

34
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,784
I was planning to show him the pool but,

35
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:25,684
it started to rain

36
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:28,584
so I left that up to Kikuyo

37
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,684
who just happened to come back from shopping,

38
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:33,984
and went to serve my husband his coffee.

39
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:35,484
Where did you go shopping?

40
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:38,197
I went to the supermarket in the neighborhood

41
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,484
to get some cream to put inside Mr. Okudaira's coffee.

42
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:45,184
Oh, I have the the receipt I received too.

43
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,284
See.

44
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,884
I see.

45
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:52,784
And, how was Mr. Okudaira when you took him the coffee?

46
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,484
I was going to take it to him,

47
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,684
but the coffee server that was supposed to be in the kitchen was gone.

48
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:01,484
Oh, the coffee server that was supposed to be in the kitchen was gone,

49
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:03,084
and here instead?

50
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:07,984
I left to go shopping leaving the coffee server in the kitchen, though.

51
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:11,484
Which means, that between the time you, Kikuyo left to go shopping

52
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,233
and while Mrs. Okudaira was with me,

53
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,235
somebody put a sleeping drug inside the coffee server

54
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:18,784
that was left in the kitchen,

55
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:21,684
and you took it to your husband.

56
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,984
What? I didn't do it!

57
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:30,249
I was cleaning Tango's car, and after I finished,

58
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:34,584
I went to the living room where everyone was.

59
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,084
That was when I heard the vase crack.

60
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:41,084
He was definitely with us when we heard the crack.

61
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:42,284
I see.

62
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,784
And who's Tango?

63
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,884
He is Mr. Okudaira's oldest son

64
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:51,284
who was killed here by the pool a year ago.

65
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:55,584
I was summoned here to unravel the case of a year ago.

66
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:56,784
I see.

67
00:04:56,784 --> 00:05:02,984
But, that man was really looking forward to hearing Pop's deduction!

68
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:04,784
See! It's written on this memo sheet,

69
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:10,289
deduction show of the Sleeping Kogoro from 4:00 pm today.

70
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,984
Ow, ouch.

71
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:19,284
I tell you brat, going around sniffing around again.

72
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,584
In other words,

73
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,284
Mr. Okudaira was hoping that the incident of a year ago

74
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,584
would be solved at about sundown today,

75
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:28,984
and was trying to gather everyone in this house.

76
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:33,184
If so, the more it is unlikely that he committed suicide.

77
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:36,084
I guess you can say so.

78
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,317
This is...

79
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,084
a trace that it was wet.

80
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,084
Coffee?

81
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,584
The table top is clean.

82
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:50,084
There is no trace of coffee having spilt.

83
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,884
This means...

84
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:55,584
My god, though. What is with this stack of books?

85
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:57,884
Was he going all out cleaning out the room or something?

86
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:02,341
No, the large books that my husband ordered arrived today

87
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,343
and he moved the other books

88
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,084
to make space for the books that newly arrived.

89
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:11,884
I see and... where are those large books?

90
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,584
Well...

91
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,355
It's that book over there.

92
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:19,984
It sure is large.

93
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:24,884
But, why is the book that just arrived on the floor near the door?

94
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,884
Maybe the culprit put it there for some reason?

95
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:30,984
Like to carry out some kind of trick or something.

96
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:34,373
You're Eisuke Hondo, if I remember correctly?

97
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,784
What brings you here?

98
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:40,384
Yes, my mother used to work as a housekeeper here.

99
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,184
I got a call saying that her belongings were found

100
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,584
so I came to get then.

101
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:46,184
Your mother passed away?

102
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:48,784
Yes, about ten years ago.

103
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,384
A picture of her back then is...

104
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:54,084
Oh, I tripped by the pool and changed clothes.

105
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:57,384
I put those clothes in the washing machine a while ago.

106
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,384
There was no picture in the pockets.

107
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,184
What?

108
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:10,409
Don't tell me you dropped it when you tripped a while ago.

109
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:21,284
My mother's picture.

110
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:31,784
Be careful.

111
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,984
Yes, I know.

112
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:47,884
Gee, I told you to be careful!

113
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,449
Ouch.

114
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,453
Here. I'll hold the picture for you.

115
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,884
Oh, thanks! Please do.

116
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,684
I see, so that's the story.

117
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:12,471
Oh, don't lose the picture, okay?

118
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,884
Don't worry! I wrapped it in my handkerchief and put it away!

119
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:28,084
Here, tissue paper. Your face is soiled.

120
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,084
Oh, thank you.

121
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,384
We've got to do something about you being such a blooper.

122
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:42,284
Or else your sister will be shocked when you found her.

123
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,984
It's all right.

124
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:56,984
But, nothing's new about me being unlucky so,

125
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,517
I think that in my older sister's eyes,

126
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:02,521
Eisuke equals an unreliable younger brother.

127
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,384
I see. So, that's the story.

128
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,784
Conan? Where are you going?

129
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,784
To Pop's!

130
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:17,984
Did you find something out again?

131
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,984
Yeah, I sure did.

132
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:23,784
I've figured out who the ruthless killer is.

133
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:27,784
The killer from the Land of the Dead!

134
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:31,184
This is undoubtedly a dying message

135
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,284
left behind by Mr. Okudaira.

136
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:37,384
The meaning is Greek.

137
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:39,684
I'm sure it's just coincidental.

138
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:41,684
It could be that he just bit his lip right before he died

139
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:42,561
because he was really vexed,

140
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:46,084
and the blood that dripped just happened to look like a message.

141
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,784
Just a coincidence.

142
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:52,284
If that book is a dying message,

143
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:56,575
does that mean that the killer is among us here after all?

144
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,184
No, your husband committed suicide.

145
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,384
Please think it over well.

146
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,384
When the housekeeper and steward

147
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,584
heard the vase crack rushed over to the room,

148
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,384
and was about to open the door

149
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,984
when Mr. Okudaira shouted from inside.

150
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,984
This means he was still alive at that time.

151
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,784
Moreover, when they did open the door,

152
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:17,984
they say that his body was still swaying,

153
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,184
so there's probably no mistake in thinking that he committed suicide.

154
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:24,184
As for the vase, he didn't want anyone else to have it,

155
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:26,284
so he cracked it before he killed himself.

156
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,384
Then, what did he use as a steps tool?

157
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:31,984
He probably stacked the books that are scattered all over the floor up

158
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:33,984
and used them as a step stool...

159
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,617
Is Mr. Mouri all right?

160
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:39,684
Yes, most probably.

161
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:41,184
It's finally come.

162
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,984
Yes, I've finally realized

163
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:47,184
by my own words, "stack the books up."

164
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:48,627
I've figured out the truth about

165
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:51,284
the ruthless trick that was carried out in this room.

166
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:55,584
As well as the fact that the killer who committed the murder

167
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,984
is among the three who are here too.

168
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,994
You're saying that Mr. Okudaira did not commit suicide

169
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,594
but was killed?

170
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,094
Right, Inspector Megure.

171
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,094
As usual, he's saying the exact opposite

172
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:15,794
of what he just said a while ago.

173
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:17,994
Let's carry out the trick

174
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,659
that made Mr. Okudaira's death look like suicide.

175
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,094
Officer Takagi!

176
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:25,094
First of all, please put that cart right under the place

177
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,665
where Mr. Okudaira is suspended in air.

178
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,294
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:36,394
Then stack up the books that are scattered around about a meter high

180
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,094
and sit on it.

181
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:39,594
You want me to sit on it?

182
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:42,294
Oh, and make sure the books stay in place.

183
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:45,594
Oh, okay.

184
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,294
I'm sitting down on it.

185
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:02,494
Then, Inspector Megure, please close the door

186
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,703
and line the remaining books up lengthwise

187
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,994
from the tires of the cart to the door.

188
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:14,294
Like this?

189
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:20,719
Yes. Then, please put the large book in the foreground of the door.

190
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,994
That one?

191
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,694
Because the book that was closest to the door

192
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:27,094
when the body was found was that one.

193
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,294
All done.

194
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:34,733
Well, this is the way the rope was put around Mr. Okudaira's neck.

195
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:38,294
Now all that was needed to be done was for someone to open the door.

196
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,194
It... it's heavy.

197
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,743
But, if you open the door exerting a bit of strength,

198
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:47,094
the books will be pushed by the door and move.

199
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:48,494
The book will in turn push the cart,

200
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:50,194
and Mr. Okudaira who is on top of the stack of books

201
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,751
on the moving cart will lose balance

202
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,294
and slide down from the stack of books.

203
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:57,994
And, Mr. Okudaira's body

204
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,894
would be hanging with the rope around his neck

205
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:02,494
like when you found him.

206
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:03,794
I see.

207
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:06,765
But, no matter if he was made to sit on the stack of books,

208
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,194
he could've removed the rope that was around his neck

209
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,594
with both his hands, no?

210
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:13,394
But, glue was stuck on to the part connecting the rope,

211
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,694
so that it wouldn't come off easily.

212
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,894
But, didn't you remove that rope when you were getting the body down?

213
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:22,494
Yes, if Mr. Okudaira took his time and went about it carefully,

214
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:25,994
he may have been able to remove it without losing his balance.

215
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:28,787
But, it seems he couldn't do so.

216
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,194
He wasn't able to use both his hands.

217
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:32,791
Couldn't use both hands?

218
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,394
But, there were no traces of the hands being tied on the corpse.

219
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:40,194
More accurately, I would say both his hands were full.

220
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,194
Just what do you mean?

221
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:45,894
He was holding the vase he treasured

222
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:48,807
with both hands behind his back.

223
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:58,194
Please look at the mouth of the vase that is on the floor.

224
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:00,394
As proof that he was made to hold the vase

225
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,494
until both his hands started to perspire

226
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:04,394
the vase is a bit glossy, isn't it?

227
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,794
True.

228
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:08,194
But, no matter how much the vase meant to him,

229
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:11,194
won't he let it go if he's life is in danger?

230
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:14,394
If he lets go, what would happen to the vase?

231
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,294
It would fall to the floor and crack.

232
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,594
What'll happen to the vase if it cracks?

233
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,839
Of course a loud sound will be heard and...

234
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,394
I get it! If a loud sound is heard, someone will run over,

235
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:27,394
the door would be opened and he would be hung.

236
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:33,794
Yeah. That's why Mr. Okudaira shouted, "Don't open the door!"

237
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,294
I see!

238
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,794
But, how did the killer get out of the room

239
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,794
after setting up the trick?

240
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,594
Well, please take a look.

241
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,694
Hey, Conan, do it.

242
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,594
Okay, I got it.

243
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,867
First, you open the door,

244
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:52,871
then you lean the book against the door that is open,

245
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,873
sneak out of the space between the door

246
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,594
and close the door gently.

247
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:02,394
So, that's how!

248
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:06,294
This way, it can be made to look like suicide.

249
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:10,294
But it's still difficult to track the killer down.

250
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:11,494
True.

251
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,394
Then, can you figure out

252
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:16,594
why only the book in front of the door is large?

253
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:17,994
What do you mean why?

254
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:21,194
The killer had to open a large space using the large book

255
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:24,594
in order to get through the door.

256
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:27,594
And, that killer is...

257
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,694
you, housekeeper Kikuyo, isn't it?

258
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,915
No way, Kikuyo couldn't have!

259
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:42,494
But, Kikuyo was out shopping for milk to put in the coffee at that time.

260
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:44,923
She probably went to buy it after committing the murder.

261
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,925
As for the coffee, probably knowing that she would be asked to serve it,

262
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,894
she prepared it beforehand.

263
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:56,394
Yes. Kikuyo put a sleeping drug in the coffee

264
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:58,194
and put Mr. Okudaira to sleep

265
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:01,494
after letting him sit on the stack of books that she piled up.

266
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:05,594
She then put the rope around his neck, gluing on the connecting part

267
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,694
then abruptly woke him up,

268
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:10,949
after which she made him hold the vase on his hands behind his back.

269
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,294
She threatened him saying that if he didn't hold the vase,

270
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:14,953
it would drop right away, crack, the books would collapse,

271
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,494
and the rope would eventually choke him to death.

272
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:19,794
She then leaves the room in the way I explained a while ago,

273
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:22,294
rushed over to the room when the sound of the vase cracking was heard

274
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:24,294
and forced the door open.

275
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:27,394
At the same time, in order to conceal her trick,

276
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,967
she pretended to stop Mrs. Okudaira

277
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:33,394
by tripping over the books on the floor.

278
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:36,694
It sure is a well prepared and ruthless way of killing someone.

279
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,994
Yes, he didn't have a chance, if he got tired and dropped the vase,

280
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:42,594
he dies, neither could he call someone for help.

281
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:46,294
Yes, this ruthless murder method is exactly the same

282
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:48,494
as the method of murder that was committed here

283
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,989
at the pool a year ago, of Tango, his son,

284
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,993
who was drowned to death by the killer!

285
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,594
Are you saying that there was a trick to that murder too?

286
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:01,594
Yes. Only the pool trick was simpler

287
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:05,003
because all that needed to be done was to tie both his legs and hands,

288
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:09,007
cover his mouth with masking tape and throw him into the pool.

289
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,294
-Throw him inside? -What trick involved is there?

290
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:15,794
His son's height was almost the same as Eisuke.

291
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:17,494
The water stain left in the pool

292
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,394
was at just about the position of where Eisuke's eyebrow is,

293
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:24,694
so if he tiptoed, he could keep his nose out of the water.

294
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:26,494
The killer probably told Tango,

295
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:31,029
"If you can hold on for an hour, I'll drain the water of the pool out."

296
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,031
I see, if so,

297
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,394
the son probably tried to keep standing on tiptoe with all his might,

298
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:38,394
while the killer establishes an alibi.

299
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:42,094
If he is left as is, he is bound to get tired eventually and drown.

300
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,043
Yeah. Tango was into body building,

301
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,045
so even if he wanted to make his body float,

302
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:50,394
he couldn't because his muscles were too heavy.

303
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,394
Isn't that right, Kikuyo?

304
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,055
You mean the murderer of the case one year ago

305
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,294
is also the housekeeper?

306
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,594
Yeah, most probably

307
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:03,061
because the method of making the victim suffer till he dies

308
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,063
is much too similar.

309
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:09,067
But, you don't have proof that Kikuyo is the murderer, do you?

310
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:12,294
Mr. Segawa and I could've used that method to kill them too.

311
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,594
Right.

312
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,394
I think that the greater also serves the smaller.

313
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:21,794
And besides, if what was found is my husband's dying message,

314
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,394
how does the "Yomi" (Land of the Dead) and the hiragana "ko

315
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,083
connect to Kikuyo?

316
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,085
That's not the hiragana "ko"

317
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,794
but rather, the mathematical symbol meaning equal!

318
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,794
What that message is saying

319
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:33,091
is that "Yomi" (Land of the Dead) equals "Meido" (Hades).

320
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:35,093
And so, that lead us to "Maid" (Pronouced as Meido in Japanese).

321
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,094
Therefore, the housekeeper.

322
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:44,694
Moreover, there is more conclusive evidence than this dying message.

323
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,894
It's inside the right pocket of Kikuyo's apron!

324
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,194
Kikuyo.

325
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:53,394
You took the tissue that Mrs. Okudaira blew her nose with

326
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:55,894
and put it in your left pocket, didn't you?

327
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:59,494
You took the receipt from the supermarket out of the same pocket

328
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,694
and put it back in there again.

329
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:02,794
Most people would never put a receipt

330
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:06,394
that is deemed important in the same pocket with trash in it.

331
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:10,894
Then, it dawned on me that maybe in your right pocket,

332
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,094
you had something inside that

333
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:15,394
you didn't want the officers to find out about.

334
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:16,894
Excuse me.

335
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:21,894
Inspector! There's a handkerchief

336
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,294
with what looks to be a coffee stain on it.

337
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,094
She gave Mrs. Okudaira who was crying

338
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:29,594
a piece of tissue paper, instead of her handkerchief.

339
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:33,151
Although there was a trace of coffee under the table,

340
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,153
the tabletop was clean.

341
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:38,294
Your husband probably spilt the coffee with sleeping drug in

342
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,157
when drinking it.

343
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,694
She probably wiped the spill with the handkerchief

344
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:44,094
and still has it in her right pocket.

345
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:47,594
Okay, send that handkerchief to the forensic section.

346
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:49,994
If they detect the substance of a sleeping drug on it,

347
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:52,894
-that will serve as proof. -Yes, sir.

348
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:55,994
But why, Kikuyo?

349
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,175
Why would you do something like that?

350
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,594
It probably has something to do

351
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,794
with the accident involving the steward two years ago.

352
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:04,594
I think that the reason has something to do with Tango

353
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,185
who stopped riding his car around that time.

354
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:11,194
Nobody's driven his car for two years, right?

355
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,594
No.

356
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:15,194
Nobody could've ridden it.

357
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:20,094
Because Tango ran someone over with it.

358
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,594
Back then, Tango was driving a foreign made car

359
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:27,205
that the previous steward was driving to take Mr. Okudaira places.

360
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,594
After having taken the car out without permission,

361
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:32,794
he drove around to his heart's content, then ran over a person.

362
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:34,294
He went crying on his father's shoulder,

363
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:35,694
who was outraged at the previous steward

364
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,594
for urging Tango to turn himself in.

365
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:42,794
And two years ago today, his car went over the cliff.

366
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,094
Don't tell me that the accident...

367
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:50,294
Tango, who I drowned in the pool told me

368
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:53,231
that he cooperated with his father and got the previous steward drunk,

369
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:58,194
then made the car over the cliff in order to keep him from talking

370
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:02,294
as well as to hide the scratch on the car.

371
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,594
Then, you mean, my older brother was killed?

372
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:07,694
That's why you chose the day

373
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:10,594
that the previous steward died and killed the two.

374
00:21:10,594 --> 00:21:14,194
How did you find out that it wasn't an accident?

375
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:18,194
Although the car went over the cliff, he didn't have his gloves on.

376
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:23,594
He always wore those gloves when he drove,

377
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:27,265
because I gave it to him as a gift.

378
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,294
Hey, Ran!

379
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:43,694
We're heading home!

380
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:46,094
Where the heck is she?

381
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:50,694
I saw your daughter and the others by the bathroom just a while ago.

382
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,194
Bathroom?

383
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:56,094
Darn!

384
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,094
Hey.

385
00:21:57,094 --> 00:22:01,094
I tell you! I off my guard about things like this!

386
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:03,994
Hey, come off it, what a thing to do out of the blue like that!

387
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:05,594
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:07,305
Darn you!

389
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,294
Hi.

390
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:14,194
What're you doing?

391
00:22:14,194 --> 00:22:17,594
His clothes got dirty so he was changing back to his original clothes.

392
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:20,894
But, he starting taking them off right in front of me.

393
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:24,894
But, I used to change in front of my older sister all the time.

394
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:35,794
Don't tell me he's...

395
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,423
Seven children.

397
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,425
Seven children remind me of the children's song about crows.

398
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,427
-Crows are black. -Black brings to mind the Organization.
