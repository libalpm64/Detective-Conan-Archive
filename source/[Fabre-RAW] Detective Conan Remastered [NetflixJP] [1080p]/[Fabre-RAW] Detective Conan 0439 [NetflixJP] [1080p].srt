1
00:00:02,665 --> 00:00:04,065
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:05,865
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:07,265
A red trace is left behind at the site of the crime.

4
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:08,765
A case that goes according to a novel.

5
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:10,565
The mystery of the invisible culprit!

6
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,965
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:13,665
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,065
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,284 --> 00:02:00,170
"Beika Station"

10
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,670
"Yasutaro Sasamoto (32), Office Worker"

11
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,870
What is that?

12
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,970
Don't tell me that he was...

13
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,270
Shadow?

14
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,570
Hikage.

15
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,670
"Toshiyuki Kamio"

16
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,170
"Shadow"

17
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,470
Yes, this is Kamio.

18
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,770
This is Sasamoto. Are you sleeping?

19
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,470
I had to keep a writer company

20
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,470
and I came home in the wee hours of the morning.

21
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,470
What's up?

22
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,470
Hikage... Hikage appeared!

23
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,770
He attacked you?

24
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,670
Just now, on my way to the station.

25
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,370
I'll be right over so stay there.

26
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,070
If I grab a cab, I can be there in 30 minutes.

27
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,370
Do that, will you?

28
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,070
"Toshiyuki Kamio (32), Editor" -Kamio!

29
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,670
"Toshiyuki Kamio (32), Editor"

30
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,970
"Shadow" -No doubt about it.

31
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,070
It's just as you said, after all.

32
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,870
Let's report this to the police.

33
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,570
Kamio!

34
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,870
But I wonder if they'll believe us, though?

35
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,870
But, we don't have a choice.

36
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,370
Right! Let's hire a detective for now.

37
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,670
You were almost killed?

38
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,870
Please, protect us!

39
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,470
We know who the culprit is.

40
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,470
He's Teiichi Hikage, a member of the mystery research club

41
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,670
that we belonged to in our university days.

42
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,970
Why do you say that he's the culprit?

43
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,070
About six months ago, I got a manuscript from Hikage.

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,170
A manuscript?

45
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,670
Of a novel.

46
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,070
A novel that predicted friends of the past

47
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,870
would be killed one after the other.

48
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,770
A novel predicting murder.

49
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,270
A novel predicting murder?

50
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,370
"So, Disappear Everybody"

51
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,070
You would've been in big trouble if it hit you.

52
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,270
Unmistakably dead.

53
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,570
Just one word "Shadow" written in red paint...

54
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,970
How distasteful.

55
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,270
Hikage was always that way since our university days.

56
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,970
Although he used to type his novels,

57
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,270
the cover of his novels were always written in revolting red characters.

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,070
Sunglasses and long hair.

59
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,470
It's unmistakably Hikage.

60
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,670
So, you received the novel in question

61
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,270
from Mr. Hikage six months ago?

62
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,170
There were several members in the mystery research club,

63
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,170
but four of us in particular were passionately active members.

64
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,370
Sasamoto, myself,

65
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,170
Takeshi Nezu,

66
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,370
and Hikage.

67
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,970
But, we had practically no opportunity to see each other

68
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,870
since we graduated.

69
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,570
However, coincidentally six months ago, that manuscript

70
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,870
was delivered to the mystery magazine editing section that I work at.

71
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,770
Unfortunately, his novel, "So, Disappear Everybody",

72
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,970
it was not a work that could be called a mystery.

73
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,670
It had no tricks or mysteries.

74
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,870
It was just a story of revenge that pointed out that

75
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,270
the main character would kill three of his university friends

76
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,870
because of a grudge he had against them.

77
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,170
Even harder to understand

78
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,370
were the names of the three who are predicted to be killed.

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,670
Takeshi Nezu, Toshiyuki Kamio, and Yasutaro Sasamoto.

80
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,370
In other words, those are our names.

81
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,370
The meaning of the queer novel was finally clarified

82
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,670
the day before yesterday.

83
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,270
The day before yesterday?

84
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,470
The night before yesterday, the dead body of a man

85
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,370
who had been stabbed in the back with a knife

86
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,970
was found in Beika Park.

87
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,870
The man who was killed was a former member of our club, Takeshi Nezu.

88
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,970
And, also written in the novel that was sent by Hikage to me

89
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,970
Takeshi Nezu dies, stabbed in the back from behind

90
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,970
in a park at night.

91
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,770
Please let me read that novel!

92
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,870
I see.

93
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,470
The method of murder is also the same.

94
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,870
I guess this is no coincidence.

95
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,570
It's not a coincidence for sure.

96
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,070
This novel is indeed a prediction of murder.

97
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,070
But something's not right.

98
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,570
Although the details of the way Mr. Nezu will be killed is written,

99
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,270
when it comes to the way and place

100
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,270
Mr. Sasamoto and Mr. Kamio will be killed,

101
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,970
there is no detailed description.

102
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,170
Oh. That's right.

103
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,170
That's why it's so eerie.

104
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,070
We have no idea when and how he's going to attack us.

105
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,970
It says that his motive for revenge

106
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,970
is because the novel he wrote in the past

107
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,170
was severely criticized by all three of you?

108
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,770
It's true that there was a time when we did. Right?

109
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,670
There was, but...

110
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,670
But such a setting is impossible in this day and age.

111
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,170
Even the trick is sort of old fashioned.

112
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,370
Your writing style is... you know.

113
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,070
It's too emotional and exaggerated.

114
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,370
It's basically lacking reality.

115
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,870
But, it goes for all of us!

116
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,670
There was a time when Hikage really razzed Kamio's work too.

117
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,670
What's interesting about this story, Kamio?

118
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,870
I think it's pretty good.

119
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,570
Why don't you crack your head in two and wash your brains out?

120
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,470
This story is totally hopeless.

121
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,470
I mean we all said and heard our share and yet...

122
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,270
Why would he want to take revenge 10 years after graduation.

123
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,170
True. Why now?

124
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,270
Have you seen Mr. Hikage recently?

125
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,970
No, I haven't.

126
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,370
Rather...

127
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,770
I thought he died long ago.

128
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,070
Died?

129
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,370
Hikage suddenly disappeared three years ago.

130
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,470
He went mountain climbing alone

131
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,870
and never came back since.

132
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,670
So, we all thought that he had an accident in the mountains and died.

133
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,370
But, he was in fact, alive!

134
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,070
So, a man that everybody thought had died three years ago

135
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,170
suddenly began committing murder to take revenge.

136
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,770
Mr. Kamio.

137
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,170
There's a parcel here for you.

138
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,770
A parcel?

139
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,870
Did you win an award or something?

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,170
I wonder if I submitted and applied for something.

141
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,670
What? Don't tell me that it's...

142
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,870
Wait! Don't open!

143
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,570
Well, that was close.

144
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,270
It could've been worse if there was more gun powder inside.

145
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,270
He probably miscalculated the amount.

146
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,170
He miscalculated the amount of gun powder?

147
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,170
Was it a mistake or was it...

148
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,570
I guess it's safe to conclude that Teiichi Hikage did this.

149
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,570
This was enclosed inside the parcel with the explosive.

150
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,070
"Shadow"

151
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,970
It's Hikage after all.

152
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,070
As a matter of fact, although it hasn't been publicized,

153
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,670
"Shadow" -beneath the dead body of Mr. Takeshi Nezu...

154
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,270
I think that it'd be better if you keep yourself hidden here

155
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,370
at the hospital for a while, Mr. Kamio.

156
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,670
I'll keep guard over you.

157
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,370
I've already got approval from the editor

158
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,970
so you can work while staying here.

159
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,170
Oh.

160
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,470
Since you're a salesman, you can't be confined to a place.

161
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,370
We'll guard you, both Mr. Mouri and I together.

162
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,970
Please do, thank you.

163
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,670
And, as for you...

164
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,070
-I'll... -Go home immediately!

165
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,770
I thought you'd say that.

166
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,670
I'll be counting on you, then.

167
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,370
Goodbye.

168
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,870
As for the whereabouts of Mr. Teiichi Hikage,

169
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,970
the officers have split up to search for him.

170
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,270
I hope you get to find where he's hiding.

171
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,470
If I stay and keep tight watch over him...

172
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,970
Granny!

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,570
It hurts.

174
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,070
Are you all right?

175
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,770
My hips.

176
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,070
Look out!

177
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,970
Hold it!

178
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,570
It's Hi... Hikage.

179
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,770
Hikage!

180
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,870
Don't worry!

181
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,970
As long as I'm here with you, I won't let him kill you!

182
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,970
After the explosive, comes the car.

183
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,170
What's with this guy?

184
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,970
Just as I thought.

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,970
That car came charging but braked once along the way.

186
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,970
Something's not right.

187
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,370
The parcel with the explosives inside

188
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,470
lacked the correct amount of explosive.

189
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,870
It looks to be just plain threat.

190
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,470
But, the first man Mr. Takeshi Nezu was killed.

191
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,270
What is the difference that the killer is feeling

192
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,370
towards Mr. Nezu, Mr. Kamio and Mr. Sasamoto?

193
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,670
Why this inconsistency in the crime?

194
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,270
Good morning!

195
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,270
Oh, good morning.

196
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,170
I'm counting on you today, too.

197
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,570
Unfortunately, we lost track of the car yesterday,

198
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,070
but if he appears again, we'll arrest him for sure.

199
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,770
Oh, excuse me.

200
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,170
Who is it?

201
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,170
Yes?

202
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,770
Long time no see, it's me.

203
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,070
Hikage?

204
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,270
I'm not getting anywhere with you being guarded

205
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,270
by a detectives and police detectives

206
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,370
so I'm going to pull away for a while.

207
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,170
He's going to pull out?

208
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,170
But, it's not that I'm giving up.

209
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,170
I'll get to you one day when I get the chance.

210
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,570
Why, Hikage? Hikage?

211
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,770
Excuse me.

212
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,070
Mr. Kamio.

213
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,070
Hikage called and...

214
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,070
I got a call from him too just now.

215
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,970
It seems he's given up.

216
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,370
So, I'm relieved.

217
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,970
But, we can't just drop the case as is.

218
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,370
Of course not.

219
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,170
Teiichi Hikage has committed murder.

220
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,870
We've got to arrest him no matter what.

221
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,770
Oh, yes, this is Takagi.

222
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,770
Yes.

223
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,470
Is that right?

224
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,770
Okay, thanks.

225
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,570
What is it?

226
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,770
They can't find the whereabouts of Teiichi Hikage.

227
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,270
Since his disappearance three years ago,

228
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,570
nobody has had contact with him.

229
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,470
Darn it!

230
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,170
He should've written where he'd be hiding

231
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,470
while he was at it writing this stuff!

232
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,370
If his motive dates back to a grudge in the past,

233
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,170
there could be a clue in the novels he wrote in his university days.

234
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,470
Novels during our university days.

235
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,970
Do you have any?

236
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,970
I have some magazines issued by Mystery Investigation Club in my room.

237
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,070
Hikage's novels are printed in them too.

238
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,870
How is it? Anything there?

239
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,470
There seems to be no clue.

240
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,070
None here, either.

241
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,770
This style of writing, if I remember correctly...

242
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,870
Just as I thought!

243
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,070
But if so, why?

244
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,370
Why?

245
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,570
Why did he do something like this?

246
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,097
We struck at air, I guess.

247
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,297
He may be waiting for a chance to attack

248
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:25,397
after throwing us off guard by declaring to pull out for a while.

249
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:27,997
We've got to hurry and find Teiichi Hikage.

250
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:31,397
I have an appointment to see a writer today.

251
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:34,097
Okay. I'll accompany you.

252
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,597
Hey, Officer Takagi.

253
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,197
Conan?

254
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:40,797
What kind of a person was Mr. Takeshi Nezu, who was killed?

255
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:41,997
What?

256
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,797
I hate to say this,

257
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,997
but he didn't have a very good reputation.

258
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:49,697
They are people who say that they lent him money

259
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,797
but he never returned it.

260
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,997
Money?

261
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,397
You mean, Nezu to me?

262
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:02,297
Yes, did he say something about money to you?

263
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:03,597
Come to think of it,

264
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:07,197
he did mention he had money, he could count on to be coming in.

265
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,197
Although I can't be too sure about that.

266
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,697
He mentioned something about an incident

267
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,497
that occurred three years ago being involved.

268
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:13,997
Incident three years ago?

269
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,097
Is it about Mr. Hikage's disappearance?

270
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:20,497
Mr. Hikage was more down to earth than he looked.

271
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:23,097
He kept saying that he would become a professional writer

272
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,897
and continued to write day after day.

273
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,097
But, I guess it didn't work out the way he planned after all.

274
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,597
It didn't work out?

275
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:31,097
I think it was two or three days before he disappeared.

276
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:32,997
He was burning the novels he had written

277
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,397
in the open lot behind here.

278
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:36,897
He did so crying in front of his friend.

279
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,197
Friend?

280
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:42,497
Do you see that person in this picture?

281
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:45,097
Oh!

282
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:46,897
Him!

283
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:50,797
No good? You mean this masterpiece?

284
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:53,297
He told me so.

285
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,997
That it's totally hopeless.

286
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:59,197
I wonder what I worked so hard for all these seven years.

287
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:02,297
And, it was right afterwards that he disappeared, right?

288
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,597
So, I figured that

289
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:08,997
maybe he lost hope and committed suicide in the mountains.

290
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:10,997
So, that's the story.

291
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:16,497
What? I called all of you?

292
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:19,097
Yeah. You said that the mystery has been solved.

293
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,997
Solve or not solve,

294
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:24,297
as to the case this time, don't have the slightest idea.

295
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:30,997
Mr. Mouri? Did it start?

296
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,597
Sleeping Kogoro.

297
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,697
Grudge held back in the university days.

298
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:38,597
Behind the case this time, this is what is involved.

299
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:40,997
I mean all know that already, don't we?

300
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:45,497
Mr. Teiichi Hikage himself says so in his novel.

301
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:49,397
Mr. Hikage is not involved in the case this time.

302
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:52,197
-Pardon? -Not involved?

303
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,397
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

304
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:58,197
It seems that Mr. Hikage was seriously continuing

305
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:01,697
to write novels in hopes of becoming a professional writer

306
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:03,697
even after graduating from university.

307
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,597
I know that.

308
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,697
But, he was troubled by not being able to write something

309
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,397
he felt confident of.

310
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:13,297
However, three years ago, Mr. Hikage finally completed

311
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:16,497
a novel he was confident of a masterpiece.

312
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,397
He took this novel

313
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:20,797
to a friend who once belonged in the same club,

314
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,097
and one who is presently working

315
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,797
in the editing section of a mystery magazine, Mr. Kamio.

316
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:27,997
He brought it to you, didn't he, Mr. Kamio?

317
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:31,097
Is that true, Kamio?

318
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:34,097
You've got the talent to pick out good stories,

319
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:37,497
so you figured out right away that his story was a masterpiece.

320
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,297
However, you...

321
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,197
What do you think, Kamio?

322
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:44,897
It's totally hopeless.

323
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,397
You probably did so

324
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,997
to take revenge on him for rejecting your novel

325
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:54,797
that you were confident of in your university days.

326
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:59,597
Mr. Hikage took your words for fact and lost all hope.

327
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:01,297
As a result, he ended up taking his own life.

328
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:02,797
It can't be.

329
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,397
Mr. Kamio as well my life is being sought after by Hikage right now,

330
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,797
so how can that be? Right?

331
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:10,997
-Yeah. -When Mr. Hikage disappeared,

332
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,297
I'm sure Mr. Kamio understood that.

333
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:19,397
He may have driven Mr. Hikage to his death by his remark.

334
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:23,097
I'm sure Mr. Kamio suffered for three years regretting what he had done.

335
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:26,597
And moreover, tried to forget the whole thing.

336
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,397
But, half a month ago,

337
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,397
one of the members of the club in the past,

338
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,097
Mr. Takeshi Nezu appeared before you,

339
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:35,097
and started blackmailing you.

340
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:40,197
You drove Hikage to his death three years ago, didn't you?

341
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:42,297
I guess I hit the bull's eye.

342
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:44,897
I read that novel which Hikage wrote.

343
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:51,097
The thing is, I sort of need some money, you see.

344
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:55,397
I figure money was not much of a problem to you.

345
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:58,397
You just couldn't bear the fact that someone knew about

346
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:00,597
the bitter past that you wanted to forget.

347
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:04,497
You wanted to erase Mr. Nezu from this world.

348
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,297
But, if you killed him just like that,

349
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:09,397
you figured that you'd be suspected.

350
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:11,097
Therefore, you decided to make it look like

351
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:14,797
the doings of Mr. Teiichi Hikage, a person who didn't exist.

352
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:17,297
You thought up a motive for the murder,

353
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,197
which was a grudge that he held against everyone

354
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,097
for criticizing his work during university days.

355
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:26,597
But, Mr. Nezu wasn't the only one who criticized his work.

356
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,997
If it's a grudge revenge, it would be strange

357
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:31,597
if Mr. Sasamoto and yourself as well is not a target.

358
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:34,497
In order to make people believe that

359
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:37,297
Hikage was trying to exact his revenge,

360
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:41,497
you wrote "So, Disappear Everybody."

361
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,197
You wrote it?

362
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:47,197
Then, just as you had written,

363
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:49,897
you stabbed Mr. Nezu in the park at night.

364
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,997
Next, you disguised yourself as Mr. Hikage

365
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,097
and attacked Mr. Sasamoto.

366
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:56,697
Hikage appeared!

367
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,497
I'll be right over so stay there.

368
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,697
If I grab a cab, I can be there in 30 minutes.

369
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:03,697
You answered as if you took the call at your residence,

370
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,497
and got there 30 minutes later

371
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:09,097
pretending to have arrived there from your home.

372
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:11,297
You went on to make it look as if you, yourself

373
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:14,097
was also being attacked by Mr. Hikage.

374
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:17,797
You waited for an opportunity to sneak out of your hospital room.

375
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:20,297
You disguised yourself as Mr. Hikage

376
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,897
and attacked Mr. Sasamoto with a car.

377
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,697
Then, you lowered the curtains to your show

378
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,997
-by using Mr. Hikage's tone of voice. -Hikage?

379
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:29,997
This line of thinking fits everything in place.

380
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:33,397
It even explains the inconsistency in the culprit's actions.

381
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:35,597
The only person you wanted to kill

382
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:38,897
to begin with was Mr. Nezu.

383
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:41,797
Isn't that right, Mr. Kamio?

384
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,097
No way.

385
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,897
It's all deduction, Mr. Mouri.

386
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:48,597
You have no evidence whatsoever.

387
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:52,397
Mr. Sasamoto fortunately remembered.

388
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:56,197
The name of the company of the cab that you rode yesterday.

389
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,297
The driver remembered you and told us that

390
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,497
there was a queer man who flagged him down near the site of the crime,

391
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:04,797
but got off after riding only a several hundred meters.

392
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:07,197
That's only the testimony of an eye-witness.

393
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,497
It's possible that this man was someone who resembled you a lot.

394
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:12,597
But, that's not all.

395
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:14,597
Oh, this man!

396
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:15,797
Of all things, give me a break.

397
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,797
It just wouldn't come off, this thing.

398
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:21,297
When you got rid of the red paint,

399
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:24,797
you used some paint happened to stick to the back sole of your shoes.

400
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:28,397
Mr. Kamio, could you let us take a look

401
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,297
at the sole of your shoes?

402
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,897
Kamio.

403
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:38,197
When and how did you figure out

404
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,497
that I was the one who did it, Mr. Mouri?

405
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,297
That novel.

406
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:45,497
"So, Disappear Everybody"

407
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:49,997
From the time I realized that you, not Mr. Teiichi Hikage

408
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,997
wrote that novel.

409
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,997
The style. The writing style.

410
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,597
Style of writing?

411
00:20:56,597 --> 00:21:01,197
The writing style of that novel is obviously different from the one

412
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:04,297
that Mr. Hikage had written in the past.

413
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:10,197
Mr. Hikage's novel had a lot of marks that expressed emotion.

414
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:14,797
But, there was nothing like that in the novel you showed us.

415
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:17,297
You didn't even use the dotted lines to describe the spaces in between,

416
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,497
and you wrote everything using just plain underlines.

417
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:22,497
An extremely restrained way of writing.

418
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:28,097
Yes, very much like that novels that you used to write in the past.

419
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,297
Habits of writing style are not easy to revise

420
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:35,097
no matter how many years go by.

421
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:37,197
Writers in particular, tend to stick and have a special feeling

422
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,797
towards their writing style.

423
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,497
You have no way out, Mr. Kamio, from something that

424
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:46,097
you had harboured inside for a long period of time.

425
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,397
Kamio.

426
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:55,197
Harbored for a long period of time?

427
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:34,997
I'm going to wash my face.

428
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:46,197
Prediction of murder! Right here!

429
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:48,197
A red "shadow"! It's written right here!

430
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:49,797
See, right here.

431
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,297
Help me, Conan!

432
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,797
Call the police, will you?

433
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:58,397
I think that's a trace of you drooling.

434
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,140
"Two cars"

436
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,780
This time next week, we will bring to you Masked Yaiba.

437
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
-Hey, come off it, no way. -Oh, I guess not after all?
