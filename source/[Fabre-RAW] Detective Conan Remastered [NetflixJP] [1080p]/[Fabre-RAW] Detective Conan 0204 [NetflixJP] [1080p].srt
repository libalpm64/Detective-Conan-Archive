1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,840
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,440
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,040
Today, the case is solved. A most unexpected killer,

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,940
unexpected motive and unexpected trick.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,490
We took a summer trip and arrived at Hotel Arimori,

10
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,490
located in the mountains of Nagano.

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,190
We ran into business man Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,390
and his wife, actress Chizuru Bizen there.

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,890
The following day, Ran, Mr. Arimori

14
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,690
and Shinobu went to the highlands;

15
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,290
While Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe

16
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,790
went out fishing to the lake.

17
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,690
Night falls, and since Chizuru had not come out of her room at all,

18
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,290
we went to her room to check on her.

19
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,490
Chizuru didn't commit suicide!

20
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,890
She was killed by someone!

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,490
"The Black Wings Of Icarus (Part 2)"

22
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,990
"8 pm, at the highlands"

23
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,190
Mr. Arimori...

24
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,990
-Where are you? -Mr. Arimori!

25
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,490
Over here!

26
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,590
I was absorbed in watching the stars,

27
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,990
since they're so beautiful.

28
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,290
Come on, Mr. Arimori.

29
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,090
Hello? Oh, Minaho.

30
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,590
What?

31
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,690
All right, okay, I'll head back right away.

32
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,090
What's up?

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,890
Chizuru passed away.

34
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,090
What?

35
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,490
I'll just leave the van here. Let's hurry back to the hotel.

36
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,590
Okay!

37
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,190
"8:20 pm, at the hotel"

38
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,490
The victim is Chizuru Bizen, an actress, 30 years old.

39
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,190
She was staying at this hotel together

40
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,390
with her husband Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto.

41
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,190
And what is the estimated time of death?

42
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,590
The estimated time of death is between 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm.

43
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,390
The cause of death seems to be

44
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,390
suffocation by strangulation of the neck.

45
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,290
You said that when the corpse was found,

46
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,990
the door was locked using the door guard?

47
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,290
Yes, and we had no choice but to break the door open.

48
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,190
The window was also locked from the inside,

49
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,290
so I'm sure it was suicide.

50
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,590
But, isn't Chizuru Bizen a famous actress?

51
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,790
Did she have any reason for committing suicide?

52
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,990
Well, to tell you the truth, there was some hassle last night.

53
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,290
A hassle?

54
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,590
She was laid off from the part in a movie

55
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,490
that she was supposed to star in.

56
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,190
She seemed to be really shocked.

57
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,090
I see.

58
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,090
Hey, you!

59
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,190
You can't go in there, sonny!

60
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,790
But...

61
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,990
That kid again!

62
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,290
You just keep still, understand?

63
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,190
But there are strange scratches here.

64
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,890
What? Scratches?

65
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,690
That's the part that the metal part of the door guard used to be.

66
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,490
There are strange scratches on the metal on the floor part too.

67
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,590
These scratches could've been made

68
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,590
when someone tried to create a locked room from the outside.

69
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,890
What? What do you mean?

70
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,690
In other words, after the killer locked the window,

71
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,390
he probably used the screw driver

72
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,390
to remove the door guard from the wall.

73
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,990
Then he went out to the corridor from the door,

74
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,090
which after he hooked the metal part of the door guard on,

75
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,790
inserted his hand through the space between the door

76
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,390
and put the screw back on.

77
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,490
But since trying to screw the screw back on

78
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,890
from such a narrow space was too difficult,

79
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,990
the killer inadvertently left scratches in the vicinity.

80
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,190
The metal part probably fell off in one blow at the door

81
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,590
because the screw wasn't screwed on tightly enough.

82
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,090
Officer, Chizuru moved this table from the window

83
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,690
and climbed on it, right?

84
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,590
Yeah, that's right.

85
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,490
Then...

86
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,090
Don't bother the officer!

87
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,090
Are there foot prints on the soles of the legs too?

88
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,390
What? Of course!

89
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,190
Why don't you check your feet...

90
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,890
Wait! Chizuru had no shoes...

91
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,090
Barefoot!

92
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,590
Were Chizuru's footprints on the table?

93
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,790
No!

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,690
What? Which means that...

95
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,190
Someone carried Chizuru up and hung her.

96
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,190
Which means that this is homicide, not suicide.

97
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,990
Last night, Chizuru was arguing with someone in the restaurant.

98
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,690
Gosh. If only I had confirmed who it was back then...

99
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,290
I wonder if there is no other evidence.

100
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,790
What's this?

101
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,290
There's some white and powdery.

102
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,290
This room sure is hot.

103
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,990
The air conditioner!

104
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,190
It wasn't running since we found the corpse.

105
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,890
Did the killer turn it off?

106
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,790
I would like to ask you a few questions

107
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,290
about the victim, Chizuru Bizen.

108
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,090
First of all, Mr. Shiromoto.

109
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,690
Yes.

110
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,690
We hear you were on bad terms

111
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,490
regarding a divorce that was pending.

112
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,290
Well, the alimony she demanded was such a huge sum, so...

113
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,690
I see.

114
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,190
Next, Mr. Miyabe.

115
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,090
I hear you wanted her to drop the star role

116
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,290
she was originally supposed to play.

117
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,490
I'm not the one who dropped her.

118
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,790
I had no choice because that's what the sponsor wanted.

119
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,490
I see.

120
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,290
Now, I'd like to ask all of you.

121
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,890
It is estimated that Chizuru died

122
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,490
between the hours of 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm.

123
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,990
I would like to know what you were doing during that time.

124
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,790
Just what do you mean?

125
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,690
It's as if you're checking on our alibis.

126
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,990
Don't tell me that Chizuru was...

127
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,790
Judging from the circumstances at the scene,

128
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,790
it is highly probable that this is a homicide case.

129
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,390
-What? -No way!

130
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,190
I hear that both Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe

131
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,890
went to the lake together to go fishing.

132
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,190
Yes...

133
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,390
I left the hotel at 10 am in the morning

134
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,790
and was at the lake right through until we returned at 7 pm.

135
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,990
You too, Mr. Shiromoto?

136
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,390
No, I forgot my lunch

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,290
so I went back to the hotel once around 12:30 noon.

138
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,290
I had lunch with Mr. Mouri

139
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,990
and left the hotel at 1:30 pm.

140
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,990
Did you see Chizuru then?

141
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,990
I went to check on her as soon as I got back to the hotel,

142
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,690
but since she didn't answer the door when I knocked,

143
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,490
so I returned to the lobby.

144
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,090
Which means that Mr. Miyabe, you were all alone

145
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,190
while Mr. Shiromoto was back here at the hotel?

146
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,190
Yes, of course.

147
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,190
I was eating lunch at the lakeside.

148
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,090
How about you two? Mr. Arimori and Shinobu?

149
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,990
We went with Conan and Ran

150
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,790
to the highlands at the top of the mountain.

151
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,790
We left right after Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe left,

152
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,490
and arrived at the highlands around 11 am.

153
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,590
We were there all through

154
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,690
and started down at around 6 pm.

155
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,390
We got back to the hotel around 7 pm.

156
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,490
I hear only you, Mr. Arimori, remained at the highlands?

157
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,190
The engine of my van wasn't functioning too well.

158
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,490
When you went to pick him up, was Mr. Arimori there?

159
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,890
Of course.

160
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,390
I was with her, so there's no doubt about it.

161
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,690
How about you two, Minaho and Honami?

162
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,990
We were cleaning the hotel in the morning.

163
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,390
Since Mr. Shiromoto came back

164
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,690
and started eating lunch with Mr. Mouri,

165
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,190
we served them tea

166
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,190
and went to have lunch in the office.

167
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,690
After seeing Mr. Shiromoto off at 1:30 pm,

168
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,090
we watched TV till 4 pm.

169
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,790
After that, we were in the kitchen

170
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,290
making preparations for dinner until everyone returned.

171
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,490
When you did the cleaning,

172
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,090
what did you do about Chizuru's room?

173
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,490
The manager had told us not to disturb her, so...

174
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,890
We didn't go near her room.

175
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,190
Were you at the hotel right through, Mr. Mouri?

176
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,890
Yes, I was watching TV in the lobby right through.

177
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,090
After Mr. Shiromoto went to check on her at around 12:30 noon,

178
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,790
nobody used the stairs by the lobby.

179
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,790
Which means,

180
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,590
the killer must've entered the hotel from the emergency exit.

181
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,090
Please describe the emergency exit.

182
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,290
There are emergency exits at the end of the corridor on every floor.

183
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,790
The doors are auto-lockable,

184
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,690
but can be opened freely from the inside.

185
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,690
In order to come in from outside,

186
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,390
you need to use the master key to open the door.

187
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,290
Which means the killer as a personnel of the hotel!

188
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,290
No, because I had the master key with me.

189
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,090
They probably had made a spare key beforehand.

190
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,590
If so, the killers are...

191
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,390
-those two! -Huh?

192
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,090
We haven't done anything...

193
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,990
Those two were watching TV with me from 1:30 pm to 4 pm.

194
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,490
If so, then all three of you are in this together.

195
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,590
Don't be ridiculous!

196
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,590
Either I, who couldn't get a hold of the master key, am not the killer.

197
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,690
No. There is a way to come in

198
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,190
through the emergency exit even without the master key.

199
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,490
No. There is a way to come in

200
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,890
through the emergency exit even without the master key.

201
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,390
What?

202
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,790
For instance, Mr. Shiromoto,

203
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,990
when you went to check on Chizuru at 12:30 pm,

204
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,990
the door can be opened from the inside.

205
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,590
Then stick a pebble or something between the door

206
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,790
so that it won't close completely.

207
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,590
After making it look like you returned to the lakeside,

208
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,690
you actually entered the hotel from the emergency exit

209
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,690
and killed Chizuru.

210
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,190
No!

211
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,290
He's pretty good.

212
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,390
As for Miyabe,

213
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,990
if Mr. Shiromoto were his accomplice,

214
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,290
carrying out the murder would've been possible.

215
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,990
What a thing to say, officer!

216
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,090
If you returned to the hotel hidden in Mr. Shiromoto's car

217
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,090
and went into the hotel from the door that he had left opened...

218
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,890
That is enough!

219
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,290
You're treating us as if we were the killers.

220
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,390
Well, I don't mean...

221
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,890
What about you people?

222
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,490
Just what do you mean?

223
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,990
There is a possibility

224
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,590
that you people have spares to the master keys.

225
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,290
You could've secretly come down from the mountain.

226
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,690
Please don't say such silly things!

227
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,390
In order to return to this hotel

228
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,790
from the highlands and the lake,

229
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,090
it is necessary to cross the bridge over the Tani River,

230
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,990
that is under construction.

231
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,890
I confirmed with the workers there a while ago,

232
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,390
and was told that the only car that crossed that bridge

233
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,290
in the afternoon was Mr. Shiromoto's car.

234
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,390
In other words,

235
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,290
the people who were capable of committing the crime are...

236
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,990
Mr. Shiromoto,

237
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,590
Mr. Miyabe,

238
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,390
Minaho and Honami,

239
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,590
and you, Mr. Mouri.

240
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,390
Me too?

241
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,790
It's exactly as Officer Mito says,

242
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,290
but something's not right.

243
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,490
For instance...

244
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,990
The air conditioner that wasn't running.

245
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,090
The white powder that was on Chizuru's skirt.

246
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,890
What on earth was it?

247
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,090
I see! Maybe...

248
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,590
This is similar to a runway.

249
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,190
What's that?

250
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,190
It looks like a mark that was made by rope rubbing against the wall.

251
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,790
Officer.

252
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,590
Mr. Mouri told me to ask...

253
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,090
What?

254
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,990
So, I'd like you all, Mr. Shiromoto,

255
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,990
Mr. Miyabe, Minaho, Honami, and Mr. Mouri

256
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,590
to come to the station with me for more detailed questioning.

257
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,990
Just who do you think I am anyway?

258
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,490
Sleep is overtaking me.

259
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,290
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,290
Please wait! It's the beginning of the Sleeping Kogoro!

261
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,690
What? So this is the rumored...

262
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,190
Please leave the rest up to me.

263
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,590
You mean you know who the killer is?

264
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,990
Yes. I know who the killer is,

265
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,490
as well as the trick that was used.

266
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,690
The trick?

267
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,490
The killer has wings.

268
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,690
Magic wings which makes what seems to be impossible...

269
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,090
possible!

270
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,390
Yes, the killer is...

271
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,590
you!

272
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,980
Yes, the killer is you,

273
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,780
Mr. Mitsuhiko Arimori!

274
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,280
What?

275
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,080
What are you talking about?

276
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,880
I was with Ran and the others

277
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,680
up in the highlands right through, you know?

278
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,780
That's right! Mr. Arimori could never be the killer!

279
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,680
That's why I just said

280
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,780
that Mr. Arimori has magic wings.

281
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,280
What do you mean by magic wings?

282
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,180
What was that?

283
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,080
That's the magic wings.

284
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,780
This was in the store room on the roof.

285
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,880
It's a hang-glider.

286
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
What?

287
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,980
And there were marks of the wall of the roof being rubbed

288
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,580
against by a rope or something right above the victim's room.

289
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,780
I see! Mr. Arimori used that hand-glider

290
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,580
and flew from the highlands to the hotel,

291
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,080
then landed on the roof.

292
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,880
He went down to the veranda of Chizuru's room using a rope.

293
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,380
After killing her,

294
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,580
he flew back to the highlands with his hand glider.

295
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,480
That's impossible.

296
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
The only time I was away from everybody

297
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,220
is when I went back to the car to get the lunches, which took me only 4 to 5 minutes.

298
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,080
It would take at least 15 minutes

299
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,280
only to set the hand-glider up too.

300
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,880
Besides, judging from the direction of the wind and the height,

301
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,580
I think it'd be impossible to go

302
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
from the hotel back to the highlands.

303
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,280
-Mr. Mouri. -It is indeed as you all say.

304
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,680
But if only to strangle Chizuru,

305
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
4 to 5 minutes would be enough,

306
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,180
if she were near him!

307
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,180
-What? -What are you talking about?

308
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,780
Chizuru was back at the hotel.

309
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,480
I get it! The van!

310
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,180
Right.

311
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,080
Before leaving, Mr. Arimori said

312
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,480
he was going to check if the doors were locked

313
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,780
and let Shinobu and the others go on ahead of him.

314
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,080
He then went over to Chizuru's room,

315
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,480
passed her out with a stun gun or something,

316
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
loaded her into the car with the hand-glider

317
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,280
and headed off for the highlands.

318
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,480
Officer Mito. When you went to check the room,

319
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,880
did you realize that the air conditioner wasn't running?

320
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,480
Yes. What you're saying is that

321
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,980
Chizuru was not in her room since before noon?

322
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,680
Exactly.

323
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,880
And at about 2 pm,

324
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,480
after telling everybody that he was going to get the lunches,

325
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,780
he left them,

326
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,580
hung Chizuru, who was passed out in the van,

327
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,380
with a rope and killed her.

328
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,080
He stayed back at the highlands alone

329
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,580
saying that his van wasn't functioning right.

330
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,380
He then assembled the hand-glider,

331
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,280
carried Chizuru on his back

332
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,480
and flew off the highlands.

333
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,580
The roof is brightly lit so...

334
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,780
I don't think he had any problem getting to his destination.

335
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,980
After you landed on the roof,

336
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,780
you went down using a rope,

337
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,580
into the room from the window

338
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
that you had left opened beforehand

339
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,780
and hung the corpse.

340
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,080
After rigging the door guard and closing the door,

341
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
you left the hotel from the emergency exit.

342
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,580
Ridiculous!

343
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,580
So, how did I get back to the highlands after that?

344
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,580
Right! When Ran and I got to the highlands,

345
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,880
Mr. Arimori was there!

346
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Maybe he used a motorbike or something?

347
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,480
The workers at the bridge would see him, wouldn't they?

348
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,680
If he were to have flown off from this hotel

349
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,380
which is at a low position,

350
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,480
it wouldn't been impossible for him

351
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,880
to get back to the top of the mountain!

352
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,780
That's why I've been telling you, Mr. Arimori used magic.

353
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,280
Magic that would enable him to get back to the highlands

354
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,680
without anyone noticing him.

355
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,080
Not your incomprehensible remark again.

356
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
The seed of magic is your car, Shinobu.

357
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
What?

358
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,380
Mr. Arimori who asked you to come

359
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,880
to the highlands for him on his cell phone,

360
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,180
hid in the trunk of your car.

361
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,480
No way!

362
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,180
Without realizing it, you were used

363
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,480
as a means of transportation for Mr. Arimori.

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,080
When the car arrived in the highlands,

365
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,580
Mr. Arimori waited for Shinobu and Ran to walk away from the car

366
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,080
and snuck out of the trunk.

367
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Then he appeared before the two ladies

368
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,580
as if he had always been there.

369
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,280
Mr. Arimori.

370
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,080
That's... that's no more than plain assumption!

371
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Do you have any proof?

372
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,280
Yes.

373
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,580
Yes, that's right.

374
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,180
All right.

375
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,880
Mr. Mouri, the inspection officers have informed us

376
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,180
the powder that was on the victim's skirt

377
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,080
was the scale of the Miyama White Butterfly.

378
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,580
So, there it is.

379
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,080
It has been verified that

380
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,780
the scales of the Miyama White Butterfly

381
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,480
that exits only in the vicinity of the top of the mountains,

382
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,780
was found on the skirt of the victim,

383
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,580
who had not set a foot out of her room.

384
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,480
According to Ran,

385
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,580
the butterfly stopped on Mr. Arimori's shoulder and died, right?

386
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,480
The scales probably rubbed off on his shirt at that time.

387
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,180
Unaware, the scale rubbed off on Chizuru's skirt

388
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,580
when he carried her on his shoulder.

389
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,680
Why did you kill her?

390
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,580
To avenge my brother's death.

391
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,780
What?

392
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,880
Revenge?

393
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,680
When my younger brother Teruhiko

394
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,080
was going to a university in Tokyo,

395
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,980
he met Chizuru who was just starting her career as an actress.

396
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,980
Teruhiko instantly fell in love with beautiful Chizuru.

397
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,880
To Chizuru, it may just have been a playful love affair.

398
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,280
Rather, she was after his money to begin with.

399
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,580
She needed a huge amount of cash to get herself started.

400
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,380
Having acted in a drama,

401
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,780
she eventually started becoming popular.

402
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,680
That's when she started staying away from Teruhiko.

403
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,180
In order to keep Chizuru from parting from him any further,

404
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,080
he began spending more and more money on her.

405
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,580
He even went as far as to use this hotel,

406
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,180
that was the estate our father left us as collateral

407
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,980
for a mortgage without telling me.

408
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,080
What? Which means that this hotel is...

409
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,380
Someone else owns it now.

410
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,980
I'm working here as manager thanks to the owner's kindness.

411
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,380
And what is your brother doing now?

412
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,580
Teruhiko who was crushed with grief,

413
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,180
recklessly maneuvered the hand-glider and...

414
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,180
My younger brother got too close to the sun named Chizuru,

415
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,380
burned his wings and fell to his death.

416
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,180
He is the wretched Icarus.

417
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,180
You did it because of a grudge you had against her?

418
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,580
I invited Chizuru out to the restaurant last night.

419
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,680
I just wanted her to say one word of apology to my brother.

420
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,980
However...

421
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,180
I don't remember a thing. What's with this picture?

422
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,180
How should I know who he is?

423
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,280
I am your ex-boyfriend, Teruhiko Arimori's older brother.

424
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
What?

425
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,080
My brother died in grief.

426
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
What are you getting at?

427
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,380
I went with him only because he was really persistent!

428
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,780
He fell in love of his own choice

429
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,480
and died of his own choice!

430
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,980
It is not my intention to blame you for anything at this point.

431
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,280
My only wish is that you visit my brother's grave

432
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,480
and say a word of apology to him!

433
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,180
Cut it out, won't you?

434
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,080
What on earth did I do anyway? I have nothing to do with it!

435
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,580
That is when...

436
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,680
I decided to kill Chizuru.

437
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,780
I wonder if your younger brother is happy about this?

438
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,280
Butterflies are said to be the soul of the dead.

439
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
To me, it looks as though

440
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,380
your younger brother's soul tried to stop you

441
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,380
and stopped to rest on your shoulder.

442
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,780
Dad sure is late.

443
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,080
I wonder where he's buying the stuff.

444
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,780
Over there.

445
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,580
Hey, girlie! Let's have tea together!

446
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,780
Hey, there cutie-pie!

447
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,080
Dad!

448
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,300
This Icarus sure is helpless.

449
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,240
Next Conan's Hint:

450
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,220
"Station name board"

451
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,360
The stage for the next episode is the Metropolitan Police Station.

452
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,260
Hey, I wonder how Officer Takagi and Officer Sato is getting along?

453
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,100
Beats me.
