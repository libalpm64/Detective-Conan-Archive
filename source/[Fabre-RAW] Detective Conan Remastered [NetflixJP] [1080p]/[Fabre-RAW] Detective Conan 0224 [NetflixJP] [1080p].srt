1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,980
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,580
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,180
Today the mermaid case is solved.

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,180
Approaching the truth with hard-headed deduction.

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,580
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,280
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,780
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,790
Heiji Hattori receives a strange letter

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,990
that prompts us to come to Bikuni Island.

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,790
What awaited us was

11
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,090
a series of murders revolving around some Dugong Arrows

12
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,490
that are said to grant the bearer eternal youth.

13
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,690
Saori Kadowaki, the girl who wrote the letter is missing,

14
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,190
and her childhood friends Toshimi Ebihara and Nahoko Kuroe

15
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,590
are murdered one after the other,

16
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,290
and on top of that, the warehouse belonging to the shrine

17
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,790
goes up in flames,

18
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,090
and the body of Kimie Shimabukuro is discovered in the rubble.

19
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,990
Is Saori responsible for the murders?

20
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,290
We go to search her room for clues

21
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,890
and make a startling discovery.

22
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,390
It's like Kudo said after all,

23
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,790
so the murderers who he said it is...

24
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,290
Kazuha!

25
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,990
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Conclusion)"

26
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,490
Heiji.

27
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,890
Hang on, Kazuha.

28
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,090
I'm going to start pulling you up.

29
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,790
Oh, no. The branch...

30
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,790
It's going to break.

31
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,690
We'll both fall at this rate.

32
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,390
Forgive me, Heiji.

33
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,690
Live a long life for me too.

34
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,190
Kazuha?

35
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,590
Goodbye.

36
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,490
You fool!

37
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,290
"Rokuro Fukuyama (28), Saori's childhood friend, fisherman"

38
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,790
Okay, Mr. Detective.

39
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,590
I brought him here just like you told me to.

40
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,590
This guy's been running all over the forest.

41
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,590
So where's that kid who speaks with the Osaka accent?

42
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,390
Oh, yeah. I haven't seen him since we got separated in the forest.

43
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,690
Heiji.

44
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,290
I don't understand.

45
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,290
Why didn't you let go?

46
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,890
We'll both die if we stay like this.

47
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,990
Let go of my hand.

48
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,590
Kazuha!

49
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,690
Don't move.

50
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,990
I'll kill you if you move, you nut case!

51
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,390
Heiji.

52
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,690
Hattori, where are you?

53
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,390
Why aren't you here? What're you doing?

54
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,790
Come on already, how long do we have to wait?

55
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,790
We police officers have a lot of work to do.

56
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,790
"Mikoto Shimabukuro (130), Kimie's great-grandmother, the Holy Person"

57
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,590
It's the Holy Person.

58
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,990
Why is she here?

59
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,190
Now that all the actors are present, let me begin explaining.

60
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,190
I'm going to give you

61
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,890
the truth behind the 3 murders that occurred on this island.

62
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,490
The first murder which involved Toshimi being hung

63
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,490
in the Mermaid's Waterfall.

64
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,890
And the second, of Nahoko being strangled in in the nets

65
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:53,090
and lastly, the murder of Kimie who was burned in the warehouse.

66
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,190
The important issue here is the second murder.

67
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,890
Judging from the evidence,

68
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,590
it appeared as though the killer walked along the shoreline

69
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,090
to get to and from the scene of the murder, but...

70
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,590
That kid from Osaka explained that already...

71
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,890
Yes, he told me too.

72
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,590
Those footprints were put there by the killer before the murder

73
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,990
to throw us off track,

74
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,690
the killer actually went to the scene during the wake.

75
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,390
Those fish scales really had me fooled.

76
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,190
The killer dropped the scales around the footprints

77
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,090
then on Nahoko's clothes after killing her, that way,

78
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,590
with the scales leading to the water,

79
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,090
the killer made it look like a mermaid was responsible

80
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,390
and that it escaped into the ocean.

81
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,790
And, the only ones who could have left the wake that night,

82
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,890
were Rokuro and Benzo, you're the only ones.

83
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,690
What...

84
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,290
By the way, Benzo, I have a question for you.

85
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,990
On the morning of the festival,

86
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,490
you're the one who sold a Dugong Arrow for 1,000,000

87
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,590
to an elderly couple, aren't you?

88
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,790
Yeah.

89
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,990
That's the arrow my daughter Saori won the year before.

90
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,590
I'm her father, I had a right.

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,490
All that money must've made you greedier

92
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,390
so when you saw that Toshimi won one this year,

93
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,090
you told her to meet you by the waterfall and then you stole her platelet,

94
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,090
set her afloat on the swim ring

95
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,490
so that her neck would get caught.

96
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,790
And as for Nahoko who also won an arrow,

97
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,590
you called her out on the night of the wake, killed her

98
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,490
and took her arrow.

99
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,490
But if the list of names were checked,

100
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,390
everyone would know Toshimi's platelet was stolen.

101
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,990
So you went to Kimie's home before we got there

102
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,490
to steal the registry, but Kimie saw you

103
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,390
so you locked her in the warehouse and set fire to it.

104
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,090
This registry that you had in your possession

105
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,490
when you were arrested proves your guilt.

106
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,990
And we've also found your fingerprints

107
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,590
on the swim ring used in Toshimi's case.

108
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,590
You're mistaken, Benzo's not the killer.

109
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,690
If Benzo was the killer,

110
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,090
he would have burned the registry along with the warehouse.

111
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,790
Besides, everyone who lived on this island

112
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,290
knew where the registry was kept,

113
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,290
I don't think he'd have to rush over to steal it.

114
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,590
Another thing, it would have been very hard for him

115
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,890
to call Nahoko out.

116
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:18,690
Nahoko noticed that Toshimi won an arrow at the festival too,

117
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,990
and she was suspicious of Benzo who had that winning number.

118
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,490
Alright then, what about the fingerprints on the swim ring?

119
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,790
I'm pretty sure he touched it

120
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,790
when he found it along with the winning platelet

121
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,990
which was snagged somewhere on the river.

122
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,790
Yeah, the detective's right.

123
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,190
I didn't want people to think I was the killer

124
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,290
just because I just happened to find the winning platelet,

125
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,890
that's why I stole the registry.

126
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,490
Then Rokuro Fukuyama, you must be the killer.

127
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,090
That's ridiculous.

128
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,790
Toshimi was your fiancee, wasn't she?

129
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,490
She would have gone to meet you at the waterfall with no suspicions.

130
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,090
No, he's not the killer either.

131
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,390
What?

132
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,990
The killer used a swim ring to kill Toshimi

133
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,390
so that she'd float down the waterfall

134
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,690
without getting caught on anything,

135
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,190
that way, it would look like an accident,

136
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,090
but being a fisherman, Rokuro has very strong arms

137
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,290
and Toshimi wasn't very heavy

138
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,690
so it would have very easy for him to just toss her into the river.

139
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,190
He wouldn't have had to use a swim ring

140
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,290
which would only be left behind as evidence.

141
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,190
But if neither of them is the killer, then who is?

142
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,290
The killer

143
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,590
made it look like Toshimi's death was an accident

144
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,590
but made no attempt to hide the fact that Nahoko was murdered.

145
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,590
Do you know what that means?

146
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,340
Well...

147
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,540
No, I don't.

148
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,440
When Toshimi was killed,

149
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,740
the police didn't arrive right away because the sea was too rough.

150
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,640
Normally, the police would have arrived sometime that night.

151
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,140
And since it was a case of murder,

152
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,740
the investigation would have been intense,

153
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,040
the killer wouldn't have been able to move around freely.

154
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,440
The killer didn't want that to happen,

155
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,340
that's why it had to look like an accident.

156
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,040
Which means, the killer planned to kill Nahoko after Toshimi

157
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,140
from the very start.

158
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,240
But no one would have known Nahoko had won an arrow

159
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,940
until she came forward.

160
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,240
That's right.

161
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,840
The killer's motive wasn't to steal an arrow

162
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,040
nor was it to kill whoever won it.

163
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,640
It was only made to look that way to mislead the investigation.

164
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,140
That's...

165
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,440
The reason why the killer made it obvious

166
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,640
that Nahoko was murdered so that

167
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,240
everyone's attention was on the scene of the crime,

168
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,140
the killer used that time to carry out the third murder.

169
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,140
The killer planned and executed each crime very carefully.

170
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,440
It wasn't on a whim.

171
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,940
The only person who could have prepared everything

172
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,240
before the festival is...

173
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,940
No, you don't mean?

174
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,540
Someone who knew beforehand that Toshimi and Nahoko had won arrows.

175
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,040
That's right.

176
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,740
You are the killer.

177
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,590
That's right.

178
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,590
The killer is the Holy Person.

179
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,290
Yes, you.

180
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,990
You've got to be kidding.

181
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,390
How can a 130-year-old lady do those things?

182
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,890
What if she had an accomplice?

183
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,190
Accomplice?

184
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,990
If neither Rokuro nor Benzo could have killed killed Nahoko,

185
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,290
then the only other person who could have done it is...

186
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,090
Kimie.

187
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,890
That's nonsense!

188
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,690
Kimie was the third victim!

189
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,290
But what if it wasn't Kimie that was in the warehouse?

190
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,490
What?

191
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,590
Kimie's dental records

192
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,190
and the burn victim's dental records were identical.

193
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,890
Don't you remember?

194
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,690
Dad, you were there too, weren't you?

195
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,590
When she said she'd gone to the dentist.

196
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,390
Yes, I heard. She said she went with Saori.

197
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,490
You don't mean?

198
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,790
That's right.

199
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,490
It was Saori's teeth that got worked on.

200
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,090
Kimie went with Saori to see the dentist on the main land

201
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,790
and when Saori wasn't looking, she took her insurance I.D.

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,390
then she insisted Saori use her I.D. instead.

203
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,790
That's how Saori got her teeth fixed as Kimie.

204
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,290
Then she killed Saori in the warehouse,

205
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,190
and set it on fire with the body inside,

206
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,890
the dental records led us all to believe it was Kimie who died.

207
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,590
Then the brown-haired girl with glasses we saw in the garden was...

208
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,190
It was Kimie in disguise,

209
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,890
that's who the witnesses saw on the morning of the festival too.

210
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,990
It was to make us suspicious about the body found in the warehouse

211
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,890
and to make Saori look guilty.

212
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,990
But all this is just your theory.

213
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,790
I called the dentist and got verification.

214
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,090
The worked on had brown hair and wore glasses.

215
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,990
Which means, Kimie Shimabukuro

216
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,890
is still hiding somewhere on this island,

217
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,590
waiting for an opportunity to escape.

218
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,590
Alright then,

219
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,990
I'll have this entire island searched from top to bottom!

220
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,990
There's no need for that.

221
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,390
What?

222
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,390
Kimie is right here in this room.

223
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,390
What did you say? Where? Where is she?

224
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,390
That can't be.

225
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,690
I don't see her anywhere.

226
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,490
Rokuro told us that

227
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,190
Kimie's talent as a make-up artist is outstanding.

228
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,990
Yes, that's right.

229
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,790
Are you saying she's disguised herself as somebody?

230
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,290
This isn't a movie, it wouldn't work.

231
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,590
You're right,

232
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,890
it would be impossible to disguise herself perfectly,

233
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,890
but what if it's someone

234
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,590
who doesn't show herself to others very much?

235
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,490
And what if the only time everyone sees her

236
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,890
is at the festival when she has on very heavy make-up?

237
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,790
Now your choices have been narrowed down significantly.

238
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,590
That's impossible.

239
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,990
But, how do you account for the height difference?

240
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,890
Think back.

241
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,890
Remember the strange corpse you found

242
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,990
when the warehouse burned down 3 years ago?

243
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,490
There were no leg bones where there should have been

244
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,590
and the locals said it was a mermaid's body, yes, that case.

245
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,990
It was probably

246
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,790
the body of a woman who died in the fire

247
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,490
with her legs bent and tied with rope made of paper or something.

248
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,890
If my theory is right, that woman was Kimie's...

249
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,840
It was my mother.

250
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,640
She carried out the Holy Person's role that was grandmother's.

251
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
It was for all the people on the island,

252
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,940
she put her heart into the role.

253
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,540
I feel so sorry for her, look what it got her.

254
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,440
Kimie?

255
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,340
You're pretty good, Mr. Detective.

256
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,540
I was pretty confident nobody'd see through this disguise.

257
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,340
It was that time when we found that the register was missing.

258
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,740
Maybe that old lady took it?

259
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
She'd never do that.

260
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,040
I was suspicious about how quickly and confidently you replied.

261
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,440
I see.

262
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,240
But while we were talking to the Holy Person,

263
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,940
we heard Kimie's voice.

264
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,740
Great-grandmother. Your bath is ready.

265
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,040
Oh that, I recorded that on a cassette tape

266
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,540
and then replayed it.

267
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,840
But why, Kimie?

268
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,140
You four were close friends since you were kids!

269
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,940
The words childhood friends mean nothing

270
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,140
when it comes to avenging my own mother's death.

271
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,040
Do you mean those three are the ones who set fire

272
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
to the warehouse 3 years ago?

273
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Yes.

274
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,340
They were angry that they didn't win arrows at the festival

275
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,540
and then they got drunk and set it on fire.

276
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,240
Mother was disguised as the Holy Person

277
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,040
and when they saw her go into the warehouse,

278
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,040
they decided they wanted to see if she really had eternal life.

279
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,940
I didn't find out until a week ago when Saori told me,

280
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,140
she was in a panic because she lost her arrow,

281
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,640
I never dreamed they could do anything like that.

282
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,240
But I thought your mother

283
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,040
disappeared 5 years ago while she was out fishing.

284
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
Mother said it would be easier

285
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,240
to play just the Holy Person's role all through

286
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,440
instead of playing 2 roles at the same time.

287
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,840
Then why didn't you admit the truth after the fire?

288
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,640
Why didn't you tell everyone the body was your mother?

289
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,740
Mother called me on her cellular phone

290
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,140
while the flames burned around her.

291
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,040
Kimie. The rest is up to you.

292
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,940
I loved this island, that's why I played the Holy Person.

293
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,440
Don't let the Holy Person die, that was what she said

294
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,840
and yet all of mother's devotion meant nothing to them.

295
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,740
After Saori lost her arrow, she had the nerve to say.

296
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,540
If you won't give me another arrow,

297
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,040
then tell me where the mermaid's grave is.

298
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,940
The mermaid bones that the Holy Person

299
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,440
had hidden in the warehouse, where are they buried.

300
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,240
I want to be like her too, like the Holy Person.

301
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,040
To be in perfect condition after being engulfed in all those flames.

302
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,440
I want to live forever!

303
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,240
I couldn't forgive her, nor Toshimi, nor Nahoko.

304
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,440
Getting them to meet me was easy

305
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,240
when I told them I'd tell where the grave was

306
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,640
after they won the arrows at the festival,

307
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,840
the eyes of those two lit up with excitement.

308
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
It was mother's grave.

309
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,640
My mother and I worked so hard for everyone.

310
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,540
But you two weren't alone.

311
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,140
Hattori?

312
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,040
I'm pretty sure there were others who knew

313
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,340
what the Holy Person was up to, isn't that so?

314
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,540
You, old man. I heard you say that now that Kimie was dead,

315
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,440
there would be no more festivals.

316
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
I meant...

317
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,490
I'm sorry, Kimie.

318
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,990
Everyone on the island knew, except for the younger people.

319
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,190
I don't believe it.

320
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,090
We also knew that it was your mother

321
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,190
who died in that fire 3 years ago.

322
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,890
After the fire,

323
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,290
we went to tell you that the festival could be ended, but...

324
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,490
when you came out dressed like the Holy Person,

325
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,390
we just bring ourselves to tell you.

326
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,890
This is the mermaid's island

327
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,190
and if you decided you carry out the role...

328
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,690
We decided to keep quiet about it and help you whenever we could.

329
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,790
We thought were doing it for the island, forgive us.

330
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,390
Forgive us, Kimie.

331
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,590
-We're sorry. -Forgive us.

332
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,790
No...

333
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,190
Why didn't you say something sooner?

334
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,590
That's right.

335
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,190
You should all have awaken from this dream sooner.

336
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,290
This dream of gaining eternal life, it was just a nightmare.

337
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,490
Life comes to an end, that's why it's so precious.

338
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,490
Knowing it has an end makes us work harder to make a good life.

339
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,890
Isn't that right, Kazuha?

340
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,390
The next morning,

341
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,990
all the people on the island went to the pier to see Kimie off

342
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,790
as the Fukui Police were taking her to main island,

343
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,590
but the sea was rough once again

344
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,790
and the ship took a long time to leave the port.

345
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,690
It was as if the sea was unwilling to let go of the young girl

346
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,490
who tried singlehandedly to protect the ways of her people

347
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,390
for 3 years.

348
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,790
When I called Saori the first time,

349
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,490
that moan I heard,

350
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,590
that was probably Kimie crying.

351
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,390
She was probably crying

352
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,690
while looking at Saori's body in the warehouse.

353
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,190
But what I don't understand is

354
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,590
why Saori sent you letter addressed to me.

355
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,490
Maybe it was just coincidence.

356
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,990
Why, Mr. Mouri and Hattori.

357
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,790
I know you, aren't you?

358
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,290
That's how we met for the first time,

359
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,190
on that diplomat, Mr. Tsujimura's murder case.

360
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,690
That's the victim's son, Takayoshi and his girlfriend, Yukiko.

361
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,290
Long time no see.

362
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,390
Did you by chance,

363
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,290
go to Bikuni Island because Saori contacted you?

364
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,590
How did you know that?

365
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,490
Yukiko's from that island and Saori used to live next door,

366
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,490
she asked Yukiko for some advice.

367
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,890
I see Kudo didn't come with you, how disappointing,

368
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,690
after I told her he was the most reliable one.

369
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,290
So it was you. You were behind that misleading letter.

370
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,790
Now I remember,

371
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,390
I did change back into Shinichi that one time.

372
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,290
By the way, did something happen on the island?

373
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,890
We arrived on the island today

374
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,490
but everyone seemed to be in such a rush,

375
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,690
we just decided to take the next ship back.

376
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,890
Well... maybe it's better if you didn't know.

377
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,290
Why'd you pick to come today?

378
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,490
The festival was two days ago.

379
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,790
We didn't come for the festival,

380
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,290
we came for the seafood on this island.

381
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,690
It's cheap, delicious and the scenery's great.

382
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,990
People are starting to talk about it.

383
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,290
I see.

384
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,590
Even without the Dugong Festival,

385
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,190
the island will still attract tourists then.

386
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,090
Guess so. I just hope their wounds heal quickly.

387
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,590
Hattori, let me see your scar.

388
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,490
What for?

389
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,590
You know why, come on.

390
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,890
That's the wound of love Kazuha marked you with.

391
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,890
Ran, what are you saying?

392
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,690
Oh, that.

393
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,790
When I got up this morning,

394
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,590
the scar had come off and it had already healed.

395
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,690
I don't believe it.

396
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,590
I should have stabbed you deeper.

397
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,290
Why you...

398
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,290
But I'm glad it's healed.

399
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,290
Now I won't have to hear you say that I almost killed you.

400
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,390
Kazuha, wait up.

401
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,290
Fool, you've just made me more fired up.

402
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,690
I'm never...

403
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,490
going to let anything happen to that girl. Never.

404
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,790
What an actor.

405
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,880
"Palm reading"

407
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,580
The next episode is truly a unique mystery.

408
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,920
Your presence itself is most unique.
