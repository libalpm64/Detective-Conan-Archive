1
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:14,522
Ms. Mejiro.

2
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:17,122
Hello, we came to look at the farm.

3
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:19,999
Ran, you're early.

4
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:24,722
This is fantastic.

5
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:27,622
It's full of autumn vegetables.

6
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:30,009
Despite it being a week day, you're working hard in the fields.

7
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:32,322
"Misa Mejiro (45), clerk" -If it's watering the field and harvesting,

8
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:34,422
they can be done after work, you see.

9
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:36,015
It's convenient since it's nearby, isn't it?

10
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:38,017
Yes!

11
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:43,322
Oh boy. Who pulled off the insect repellent net?

12
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,422
"Shinichiro Taguchi (51), office worker" -After all the trouble

13
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:47,422
I went through to make it for my vegetables.

14
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,322
You're the one who did it, aren't you?

15
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:53,822
Beats me.

16
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,222
"Takehiko Nakamura (73), unemployed" -Although now,

17
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,522
my lot can get a lot of sunshine.

18
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:03,622
Only if Gramps Troublemaker weren't here, this place is super...

19
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:10,322
Don't throw the weeds that you pulled out onto my lot!

20
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,822
Beats me.

21
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,322
"Marie Inoue (26)" -How many times do I have to tell you?

22
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,522
Will you please cut it out?

23
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:18,057
Lay off! I told you I know nothing of it!

24
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:23,222
There was a time when my lot was soaked in water, you know.

25
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:26,065
What a troublemaker, the old man!

26
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:27,722
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:30,822
You had to see all this unpleasantness after coming here.

28
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:33,722
Hey, won't you come help pick the vegetables next time?

29
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:37,322
I'll share some of my organic vegetables with you, too.

30
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:39,822
Eating vegetables eaten by insects all over like that

31
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:42,722
won't taste good at all.

32
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,085
What's with this farm?

33
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:07,622
Brooding over passing seasons

34
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:09,422
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

35
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,422
A murder is committed on the roof far!

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,622
Today, scarecrow Kogoro makes his appearance!

37
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,322
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,122
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:19,222
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

40
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:48,953
"Trap of the Roof Farm"

41
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:53,653
Dad's really all for it.

42
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,217
I'm going to make French fries with the potatoes I pick from the garden

43
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:01,753
and eat them as snacks with beer!

44
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:04,223
Don't go making holes in the roof.

45
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,233
That's...

46
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,853
The old man we saw the other day?

47
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,153
No good.

48
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,653
A wound on his forehead, too?

49
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:41,653
The victim is Mr. Takehiko Nakamura, 73 years old.

50
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:44,263
He's an elderly man who lives in the neighborhood.

51
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,053
The estimated time of death

52
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,267
seems to be around 10:00 in the morning.

53
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,053
When you came to this roof farm,

54
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,753
you found Mr. Nakamura lying on the ground?

55
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:56,853
Yes, we found him about 11:00!

56
00:04:56,853 --> 00:05:00,279
By the way, why are you dressed like that?

57
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:01,653
I've come with my daughter to help

58
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:05,453
a person called Ms. Mejiro to pick vegetables!

59
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:10,653
Oh, well. Does Mr. Nakamura rent a lot here?

60
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:15,053
Yes. He seems to have been a habitual troublemaker,

61
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,753
and was called "Gramps Troublemaker"

62
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,253
by the others who rent lots here.

63
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,953
I see.

64
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:25,153
We'll have to check either way if we've got a case here or not.

65
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:27,153
The cause of death seems to be that

66
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:29,153
he hit the back of his head really hard.

67
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,653
He must've hit his head on the water container

68
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:33,753
that was in the field.

69
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:36,315
So he fell on his back.

70
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,753
There are traces that look like he slipped.

71
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,853
Why does he also have a wound on his forehead?

72
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,753
It's still new.

73
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:47,853
I wonder if he hit it some place?

74
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,553
Maybe he tried to wash his hands

75
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:51,853
and hit his forehead on the faucet.

76
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:54,353
He then was surprised, lurched backwards,

77
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,853
slipped and fell on his back.

78
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:58,337
What do you think?

79
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:02,953
That's why the towel was on the ground behind the faucet.

80
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,953
What's that dirty part?

81
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,953
I had the forensics check it and found that

82
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:10,349
it was the same substance as what's on the railing of the fence.

83
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,053
He probably hung it on the railing.

84
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:16,053
Why does he have two towels?

85
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,953
A cell phone was found near the body.

86
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:22,361
Check to see if it really belongs to Mr. Nakamura, will you?

87
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,253
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,353
Is there any other way in and out of here

89
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,053
besides that elevator?

90
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,153
The stairs of the emergency exit is under construction now.

91
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:33,853
So, there seems to be no stairs available to make access here.

92
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:37,853
Which means that, the only access here is by using that elevator.

93
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:40,379
There seems to be no buildings higher

94
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,053
than this one in the surroundings.

95
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:46,053
This building... the windows are all barred.

96
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,153
So, there's no way that anyone could climb out the window

97
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:51,553
and go up to the roof.

98
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:54,053
Check the images on the surveillance camera of the elevator

99
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:56,653
and see if anyone went in to or out of the roof!

100
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:58,053
Yes, sir!

101
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:00,853
I guess we should go talk to the people involved of this farm

102
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,401
to see if we've got a case here.

103
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,553
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:06,405
Takagi! Go gathered the people involved!

105
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,407
Yes, sir!

106
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:13,953
But this dead body sure is in a strange position.

107
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,253
What is it?

108
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,653
His position...

109
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:21,653
Don't... Don't tell me that...

110
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:24,053
What is it, Mouri?

111
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,953
Inspector! This dead body!

112
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:29,453
Doesn't it look like he's pointing his index finger at his own face?

113
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:33,653
I guess you could say that.

114
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,453
But, if you slip and fall,

115
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,437
there's a chance that you may end up this way, isn't there?

116
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:40,953
Ran!

117
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:43,753
Who are the other people that we met the other day on this farm

118
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:46,445
that are renting land besides Ms. Mejiro?

119
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:47,753
Uh...

120
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,153
Office worker, Mr. Taguchi,

121
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,953
office lady, Ms. Inoue... I think it was.

122
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:55,453
Inspector, there are people whose name have the kanji character

123
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:57,553
representing part of a face in their name!

124
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,453
Ms. Mejiro = Eye!

125
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,553
Mr. Taguchi = Mouth!

126
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,153
Maybe Mr. Nakamura was trying to tell us

127
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:05,153
who the one who murdered him is

128
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:07,353
by pointing to that part of his face!

129
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,853
Are you serious?

130
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:12,753
But it's difficult to determine

131
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,473
which part of his face he is pointing at.

132
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,153
Was it the eyes or the mouth?

133
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:23,053
The police wants to talk.

134
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,483
What on earth about?

135
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,853
Mr. Nakamura was found dead on the roof farm this morning.

136
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,353
What? Gramps Troublemaker?

137
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:35,053
So, our farm will find some peace from now.

138
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:38,753
I feel like my heart has suddenly gotten light.

139
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,153
Are you sure it's them, these three people?

140
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,553
Yes, sir. When I came to the farm the other day,

141
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:47,853
I heard that those people were being troubled by Mr. Nakamura.

142
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,509
He soaked Ms. Mejiro's lot in water.

143
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,653
Mr. Taguchi's insect repellent net was broken by him.

144
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:54,513
Ms. Inoue said that

145
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,353
he had disposed of the weeds he pulled out on her lot.

146
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:01,153
I'm sure that they had other things done to them, too.

147
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:03,253
So, all of the things he did accumulated hate after hate in them

148
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,523
and they finally...

149
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:07,453
Hey, you mean that old man was killed?

150
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,953
Don't tell me you think we did it?

151
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,053
Come, come...

152
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,153
We haven't concluded it's a murder yet.

153
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,253
We just want to hear what you have to say,

154
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,653
so would like to ask you to cooperate with us voluntarily.

155
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:21,753
Please tell me what you three were doing and where you were

156
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:26,545
around the estimated time of death of the victim.

157
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:31,853
Okay. Ms. Mejiro, I believe your lot was diagonally across

158
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:34,953
from Mr. Nakamura's, shall we start with you then?

159
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:39,453
I work at the office here on the first floor of this building.

160
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,153
Since I couldn't finish my accounting work yesterday,

161
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:45,953
I worked on my day off and came in about 08:30.

162
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,553
Where were you at 10:00?

163
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,253
Since Ran and the others were coming here

164
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:53,253
to help me pick vegetable around 11:00,

165
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:56,575
I was working in the office till then.

166
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,053
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

167
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,579
Since it's Saturday today,

168
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,753
there's nobody else in the office but me.

169
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:06,353
Since Ms Mejiro works in this building,

170
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:09,153
so she can come up here right away.

171
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:11,953
Maybe the finger of the dead body was pointing at his "eye".

172
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:17,753
Then, the officer worker that has a lot next to Mr. Nakamura's,

173
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:20,599
Mr. Taguchi, how about you?

174
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,353
I went to the home center in the morning

175
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,553
to buy some fertilizer and stuff.

176
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:28,607
The fact is, I was going to come to the farm from afternoon anyway.

177
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:31,053
Is there anybody who can prove that for you?

178
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,615
If the salesclerk at the home center remembers me...

179
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,619
Right! I've got the receipt!

180
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:43,253
Here it is!

181
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:50,953
A receipt that indicates 11:00 doesn't serve a proof.

182
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,953
Oh, no...

183
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:56,153
Maybe his dying message was him pointing at his "mouth".

184
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:01,353
Then, how about you, office worker Ms. Inoue,

185
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:04,643
whose lot is next to Mr. Nakamura's?

186
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:08,647
Since I'm off work today, I got up late.

187
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,253
And, how about around 10:00?

188
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,953
I wonder...

189
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:15,753
I think I was groggily watching TV after I got up.

190
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:20,053
I have nobody who can prove that since I live alone.

191
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,753
Ms. Inoue lives right below the roof,

192
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:28,153
but there's nothing in her name that represents the part of a face.

193
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:31,653
There's no one here that has a definite alibi.

194
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:34,673
You'll have to come with me to the site,

195
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,953
so I can ask you further questions.

196
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:41,753
Gramps Troublemaker troubles people even after he dies!

197
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,553
Be it an accident or murder,

198
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,453
there's no mistake that he brought it upon himself.

199
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:49,553
He goes and bumps his head on his own and dies.

200
00:11:49,553 --> 00:11:51,353
Then he gets us all messed up in this.

201
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,153
What a bummer.

202
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,713
Yes.

203
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,143
I see. I understand.

204
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,343
Inspector.

205
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:21,943
That cell phone was Mr. Nakamura's cell phone after all.

206
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,143
At around 10:00 in the morning,

207
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,143
he received a call from a non-displayed number.

208
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:29,043
It seems to have been dialed from a pre-paid cell phone.

209
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:31,943
We haven't figured out who the caller was.

210
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:34,733
-Check on it just to be sure! -Yes, sir.

211
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,443
What shall we do with the three people?

212
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,943
There seems to be no change in their attitude or testimony

213
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,043
even after seeing the site.

214
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,543
Inspector!

215
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:48,443
I've confirmed the images in the surveillance camera of the elevator.

216
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:51,543
Mr. Nakamura went up to the roof with the elevator at 09:00.

217
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:53,243
Then, until Mr. Mouri and his party

218
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,743
went up the elevator to the roof at 11:00,

219
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:57,943
no one else did.

220
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,443
So, no one other than Mr. Nakamura went up to the roof.

221
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:05,043
There seems to be nothing suspicious.

222
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,443
In other words,

223
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:10,143
this is an accident that frequently occurs to the aged.

224
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,943
After finishing his farming work,

225
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:14,343
he caner to the faucet to wash his hands.

226
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:15,943
Then, his cell phone rang,

227
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:17,943
so he got distracted and slipped

228
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:21,643
and hit the back of his head on the corner of the water container.

229
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,543
This seems to be what happened.

230
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:24,783
You mentioned earlier that

231
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,043
the strange position that the dead body was found,

232
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,443
it may have some meaning though?

233
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:32,443
Oh, no, well, I just meant that it could be a possibility.

234
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:35,943
When he slipped and fell,

235
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:38,797
he twisted his body in surprise.

236
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,243
How about the wound on his forehead?

237
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:41,743
It could be that the cell phone

238
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:45,343
that he was holding hit his forehead when he fell!

239
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,807
Okay. Let's conclude the case as an accident.

240
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:53,543
Something bothers me.

241
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,443
There are two suspicious points.

242
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,243
The wound on Mr. Nakamura's forehead,

243
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:00,143
and why is it that he had a towel around his neck

244
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,821
and yet, another towel was found on the ground.

245
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,843
Ran! If you touch anything at the scene,

246
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,943
the officer will get angry at you!

247
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,943
The prop was down, so I inadvertently...

248
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,837
This is...

249
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:29,543
I see. So, that's the story!

250
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,043
So, now we get to go.

251
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:32,851
If it's an accident,

252
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:34,853
they should just tell us it is from the beginning.

253
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:37,443
My day off's been totally wasted.

254
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,943
I'm counting on you, Pops.

255
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:51,343
Wait...

256
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:52,543
Oh, no!

257
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,873
Inspector!

258
00:14:54,873 --> 00:15:00,443
There's a person among the three who killed Mr. Nakamura,

259
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:03,243
and is deceiving the police by making it look like an accidental death!

260
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:04,643
-What? -What?

261
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,343
What're you talking about?

262
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,043
You yourself said a while ago,

263
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:10,543
that this was a case of accidental death, didn't you?

264
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,893
That was a lie to catch the killer off guard.

265
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,543
Will you please gather the suspects here?

266
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,443
Are you planning to make your deduction like that?

267
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:23,943
Who cares about how I'm dressed.

268
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:27,243
What's important is the truth of the matter!

269
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,743
Goodness. What on earth's going on?

270
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,643
Geez.

271
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:34,043
The one who killed Mr. Nakamura

272
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:38,143
used a certain trick to make it look like an accident.

273
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:40,143
-What? -Trick?

274
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,143
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

275
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,443
You're still going on?

276
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,443
I figured out that it was a trick

277
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,943
at seeing the wound on Mr. Nakamura's forehead.

278
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:51,843
He wouldn't have that wound if he actually did slip at the place

279
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,243
where the faucet was and fell on his back.

280
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,935
Something came flying and hit him on the forehead!

281
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:59,643
But, hasn't it already been confirmed

282
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,443
that there are no other buildings nearby

283
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,941
where something can be thrown from?

284
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,843
Yes, that's why we were all deceived.

285
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,843
Our boy found something interesting

286
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,643
among the Chinese cabbage field.

287
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:12,043
Hey, Conan!

288
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,243
Here it is.

289
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:14,943
I gathered it and put it together

290
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,243
and it became one block of brick.

291
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,243
This is...

292
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:22,643
There's a hole in the middle.

293
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:25,643
The pieces of the brick were scattered

294
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:29,343
near the borders of Mr. Nakamura and Ms. Inoue's field.

295
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,643
That came flying

296
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:33,343
and wounded Mr. Nakamura on the forehead.

297
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:37,943
It probably shattered because it hit the paving stone.

298
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:41,543
Came flying... from where?

299
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,843
The brick came flying

300
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,843
not from the side but from below.

301
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,743
From below?

302
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:49,343
The towel was on the ground

303
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,243
between the faucet and the fence, wasn't it?

304
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,343
I thought it was strange.

305
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:56,143
Despite Mr. Nakamura having a towel wrapped around his neck,

306
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:58,997
the fact that there was another towel at the site bothered me.

307
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,243
Come to think of it,

308
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:03,643
the old man had his initials embroidered on his towel.

309
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,743
There's none on that one.

310
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:08,243
Inspector, you remember that the paint from the railing

311
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,943
was stuck on the back of the towel, don't you?

312
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:15,013
Yeah, I heard the report.

313
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,015
But, what about it?

314
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,443
The remains of the paint

315
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:21,343
looked as if it had been scraped on strongly.

316
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,743
The towel was hung on the railing of the fence

317
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,943
and scraped along strongly against something

318
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,043
then eventually fell where it was found.

319
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:29,843
Just what do you mean?

320
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:34,243
The killer pulled a rope through the brick

321
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:37,035
which had a hole made in it

322
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,343
and the towel that was hung on the railing of the fence of the roof,

323
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:41,343
was probably sandwiched between the railing and the rope.

324
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:44,843
And, when Mr. Nakamura came in front of the railing,

325
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:47,443
the rope was pulled strongly from the floor below!

326
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:54,543
Mr. Nakamura then slipped,

327
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:56,343
and bumped his head on the water container

328
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,057
that was left there beforehand.

329
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:02,043
The brick that came flying hit the paving stone shattered

330
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:04,043
and fell into the field.

331
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:07,643
The killer pulled the rope and retrieved it,

332
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:11,069
but the towel was still left back at the scene of the crime.

333
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:12,843
She sandwiched the towel

334
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,343
in order to block Mr. Nakamura's vision

335
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:18,843
so that he wouldn't see the brick that was hanging.

336
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:22,243
In other words, the person who killed Mr. Nakamura...

337
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:30,143
is you, Ms. Inoue!

338
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,443
-What the? -What's this?

339
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:34,543
What?

340
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:37,095
Me? Why would I?

341
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,743
I see.

342
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,143
The only one who could've carried out this trick

343
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,843
is Ms. Inoue who lived right below!

344
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:45,443
The faucet is right below the window.

345
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:49,107
Besides, Mr. Nakamura left a dying message behind.

346
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:50,643
What?

347
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,111
After hitting her head on the faucet,

348
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,143
Mr. Nakamura realized that you had done this,

349
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:59,117
so he left a message behind pointing you out as the killer.

350
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,119
There's no part representing a part of the face

351
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,543
in the Kanji character of Ms. Inoue's name though?

352
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,123
No.

353
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:08,743
Mr. Nakamura's finger wasn't pointing at anything on his face,

354
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:10,843
but rather at the floor below.

355
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:14,843
In other words, it was a dying message saying that

356
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,135
Ms. Inoue who lived right below killed him.

357
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,743
I understand that by doing what you just explained,

358
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:24,143
it's possible to wound Mr. Nakamura's forehead and make him fall,

359
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:28,843
but how did she lure Mr. Nakamura over to the railing?

360
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,243
Right.

361
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:32,743
Are you saying that I shouted out loud or something?

362
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:36,043
If I do that, the neighbors would suspect me!

363
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:37,743
It's simple.

364
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,159
You used a prepaid cell phone.

365
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:45,843
After confirming that only Mr. Nakamura was on the roof,

366
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:49,167
you lured Mr. Nakamura over to the place where the towel was

367
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,169
by giving him whatever reason

368
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,171
and pulled the rope from below!

369
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:57,175
That only deduces that I was the only one

370
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,177
who could've used that trick, doesn't it?

371
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,343
The dying message sounds like

372
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,943
something you just put together for the heck of it.

373
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:03,843
Or, do you have any proof?

374
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,443
Concrete proof.

375
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:08,643
Before coming up to the roof, you said...

376
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:12,743
He goes and bumps his head on his own and dies.

377
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:14,543
Then he gets us all messed up in this.

378
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,443
What a bummer.

379
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:20,343
Back then, the police had not explained anything

380
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,543
as to Mr. Nakamura's cause of death yet?

381
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:26,943
The only person who could've made that remark

382
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:30,143
is the killer, Ms. Inoue!

383
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:35,213
Officer Chiba.

384
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,215
Was Ms. Inoue shown on the surveillance camera

385
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,743
of the elevator after 10:00?

386
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:42,643
No, not even once.

387
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:45,743
Which means that Ms. Inoue had not left her room since.

388
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:49,227
If so, it should still be in her room,

389
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:52,643
the rope that she used to kill Mr. Nakamura!

390
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:55,233
-Officer Takagi. -Yes, sir.

391
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,943
You don't mind us checking your room, do you?

392
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:04,443
You don't have to go out of your way to check.

393
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:06,943
Just as the detective said,

394
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,443
it's in my room

395
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,249
because I didn't have time to get rid of it.

396
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:14,243
Yes, I did it.

397
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:17,043
I killed that hateful troublemaker old man!

398
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,243
Oh, no. What a thing to do,

399
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:21,259
even if he did cause a lot of trouble to the people around him.

400
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,943
Trouble?

401
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,943
He did way more than cause trouble!

402
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,943
The vegetables that I gave all my love and care to

403
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,043
in raising over so many months

404
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:32,343
was all killed because of his insecticide!

405
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,143
That old fart...

406
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:37,275
Oh, so these were vegetables.

407
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,543
I thought they were weeds since they looked so flimsy,

408
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:42,043
so I poured insecticide on them.

409
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:46,043
They were vegetables that I raised from the seeds

410
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:49,943
that my father who died of an illness left behind for me!

411
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:54,943
I couldn't forgive him for insulting my vegetables that way!

412
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:29,043
Ms. Inoue seems to have been living with her father

413
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:33,391
who was a farmer from the time she was a child, just the two of them.

414
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,943
So, when her father died of an illness,

415
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:37,943
the only thing that kept her going on living

416
00:23:37,943 --> 00:23:40,743
were probably raising vegetables.

417
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:44,243
Huh?

418
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:46,443
I can't shake the feeling of having forgotten something.

419
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:59,417
Pops, play your role as Scarecrow Kogoro for a while longer.

420
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,423
"Coke"

422
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,425
Shake well before drink!

423
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:10,780
Hey, wait! Don't open the can pointed toward me!
