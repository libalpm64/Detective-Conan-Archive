1
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,755
I didn't think that it wouldn't be around anymore.

2
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,991
I hear they're going to build a condominium.

3
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,655
Too bad, because it was a delicious diner.

4
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:16,555
Too bad.

5
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:18,955
Well, let's go, then.

6
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:19,999
Come to think of it,

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:23,255
there are a lot of new buildings being constructed around here.

8
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:24,955
Over there, too.

9
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:28,007
Yes, that used to be a sweet dumplings shop.

10
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,055
Over there, too.

11
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:31,755
There used to be an old apartment there.

12
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:32,955
There, too.

13
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:35,455
That used to be a bookstore, I think.

14
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:36,855
Over here, too.

15
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:38,855
Take a good look. They're renovating the place.

16
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,021
Over here, too.

17
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,655
What about here?

18
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:46,025
This was an old public bath house.

19
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,027
I came here a few times, too.

20
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:52,031
It looks like this place is going to be a facility for bathing.

21
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,255
Gosh.

22
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:56,035
If so, they should've just left it as is a bath house.

23
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,655
You can say that again.

24
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:01,055
I guess that's what they call business.

25
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,255
But it's sort of sad to think that

26
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,955
things from the past are disappearing.

27
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:06,355
I guess so.

28
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:15,055
What's the matter?

29
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,455
Somebody, call an ambulance!

30
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:25,755
-Ran, get an ambulance! -Yes, sir.

31
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,855
Mr. Inomata's not here.

32
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:31,555
He was in the smoking room a while ago, so maybe...

33
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:32,555
Darn it.

34
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,355
Mr. Murase, hurry up!

35
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,855
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:51,355
Aiming for a 100% solution.

37
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,555
Clear all mysteries and codes.

38
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,355
Shocking sound at a construction site!

39
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,255
An awesome deadly trick is schemed.

40
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,855
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:00,955
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,355
His name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:50,209
"Unidentified Impact"

44
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,832
Okay, give me an outline of this case.

45
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,932
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,932
At about noon today, there was an accident

47
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,232
in which the pipes that are used as footings collapsed.

48
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:03,332
The victim is Mr. Yuji Inomata, age 56.

49
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:05,832
He seems to be the owner of this site.

50
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,227
The cause of death is bruises all over his body

51
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,832
due to being buried under collapsed pipes.

52
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,532
They say that it is most likely that he died instantly.

53
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:13,732
Inspector.

54
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:15,432
There was a trace on the band bunching the pipes together.

55
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:18,832
Someone deliberately making a slit on it.

56
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,232
I think would be reasonable to say that

57
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:24,243
this is a homicide rather than an accident.

58
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:28,247
But I wonder why Mr. Inomata was there?

59
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,132
There was an ashtray under the pipes that were collapsed.

60
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:34,032
Maybe it was the smoking area or something?

61
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,832
The smoking area?

62
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:37,132
I see.

63
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,432
Come to think of it, there were cigarette butts

64
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:42,032
found at the feet of the victim.

65
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,332
Mr. Inomata was a heavy smoker.

66
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,267
Anytime he had time, he'd go to take a puff.

67
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:51,732
They are people who were at the scene when the accident occurred.

68
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:54,273
They're all personnel of this construction site.

69
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:58,632
He's Mr. Inomata's chauffeur, Mr. Masao Kaneda.

70
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:03,432
He's Mr. Takeshi Nojima, the construction director of this site.

71
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:06,285
And he's Mr. Naoki Murase, an architect.

72
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,932
He seems to be in charge of designing this place.

73
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:12,932
Will you tell me your circumstances just before the accident?

74
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:15,132
Back then, I was told by Mr. Inomata

75
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,297
to go buy coffee or something for the guest.

76
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:22,301
I went to the vending machine behind the site to buy coffee.

77
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,832
When I got back, the pipes were collapsed.

78
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,632
Who was that guest?

79
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,309
It's me.

80
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:33,732
I came to talk out about details.

81
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,732
Details?

82
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,932
Rather, I came to discuss

83
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,332
the concept of the setting of this place.

84
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:42,932
And while Mr. Kaneda was out buying coffee,

85
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,932
I decided to call my office.

86
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,032
During that time,

87
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:50,329
Mr. Inomata left for the smoking area to take a puff.

88
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,132
After a while, I heard a loud noise.

89
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:55,532
I looked towards the smoking area...

90
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:58,032
I was on lunch break,

91
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,332
so I was here at the office.

92
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:03,532
Then, I heard a loud noise.

93
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,345
So you all came here

94
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,932
since you heard the loud noise, right?

95
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:12,132
No one saw the pipes was collapsing?

96
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:15,732
Is this an accident?

97
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,432
Or maybe...

98
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,432
We haven't put aside the possibility of homicide yet.

99
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,132
If I remember correctly,

100
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:30,369
Mr. Kaneda borrowed money from Mr. Inomata.

101
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,232
What the...

102
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:33,632
The other day, I heard Mr. Kaneda say

103
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:38,377
that if Inomata disappears, he can call it a wash.

104
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,379
Hey, hold on!

105
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,381
It's true that I did say that.

106
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:46,385
It was because I was a bit pissed back then.

107
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,132
What makes you think that I'd go as far as to kill somebody

108
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:49,532
just because of something like that?

109
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:53,132
I think you would.

110
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:56,395
If so, then you're just as prone to, aren't you?

111
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,032
You were arguing with Inomata

112
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,399
on whether to lower or higher the architectural fee, weren't you?

113
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,132
That's right. You're the one who specified

114
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,832
that place to be the smoking area too, right?

115
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,832
You specified that place so that you could

116
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:07,832
take your grudge out on Mr. Inomata, didn't you?

117
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:10,432
I have no grudge against Mr. Inomata.

118
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,432
Don't play dumb with me!

119
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,132
Mr. Kaneda, calm down.

120
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,232
Come to think of it, you're to be suspected too.

121
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,532
You were angry after Mr. Inomata turned

122
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:24,132
your concept of the plan down many times.

123
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:27,432
No. I would never do that.

124
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:31,332
Well, calm down, everyone.

125
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:34,132
At any rate, I didn't do it.

126
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,032
Inspector Megure.

127
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:44,132
From the blade of the knife that was found,

128
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,732
a band made of the same nylon

129
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,447
that was holding the pipes together was found.

130
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,132
Judging from the way the substance was stuck on,

131
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:52,232
there's seems to be no mistake

132
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:54,453
that the band was severed with this knife.

133
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,455
Good work.

134
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,932
Well, so this is it.

135
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:02,732
The culprit is Mr. Kaneda.

136
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,032
It's you.

137
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:05,732
Why me?

138
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:08,232
There's no use to play dumb.

139
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,132
This is yours, isn't it?

140
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,932
Your name is carved on it.

141
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:16,475
After Mr. Murase went outside to receive a phone call,

142
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,032
you pretended to go out to buy coffee

143
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,232
and went around behind where the pipes were stored.

144
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:22,481
You used the knife that you had with you

145
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:26,485
to cut the band that was holding the pipes together.

146
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,032
And after the pipes collapsed,

147
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,032
you ran over to the site of the accident

148
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:32,232
as if you knew nothing of it.

149
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:35,132
-But I don't think that was possible. -What?

150
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:38,497
Because out of all the pipes that were bundled together,

151
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:42,232
only the pipes nearest to the smoking area were collapsed.

152
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:43,432
There seems to be no space

153
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:47,132
for anyone to hide in an arm's reach, you see.

154
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:48,932
And yet, if the band holding the pipes together

155
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,032
were cut from smoking area side,

156
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:52,032
it would be in clear view from Mr. Inomata.

157
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,432
First of all, the culprit would also be at risk

158
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,032
of being struck by the pipes.

159
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:57,032
-So... -Shut up!

160
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:59,332
The culprit somehow managed to follow through.

161
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,132
How he managed it?

162
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:02,521
At any rate,

163
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,632
there's no doubt that Kaneda is the culprit.

164
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,532
The knife at the site is immovable evidence.

165
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:12,032
Wrong. I lost it yesterday.

166
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:15,732
You can make up an excuse like that any way you want.

167
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:17,332
Then, Mr. Kaneda,

168
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:18,532
would you please tell us about your knife

169
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:21,632
as well as some other details?

170
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:23,432
I don't mind.

171
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,332
But I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

172
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:28,832
May I excuse myself to go to the restroom?

173
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,532
I would like to make a call to my office.

174
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:32,551
All right.

175
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,332
I'd like to also talk to you two later,

176
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:37,632
so please don't leave the premises.

177
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,332
Even from what the forensics came up,

178
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:49,932
there's no doubt about the fact

179
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,332
that the band was cut with that knife.

180
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,573
But I wonder if anyone would risk doing something like that

181
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,932
knowing that he would also be endangering himself.

182
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,132
Besides, the sound back then...

183
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,832
This is...

184
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:38,617
Sir, what's this?

185
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,619
Oh, that?

186
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,332
That's the plan of the concept

187
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:45,532
that Mr. Murase showed Mr. Inomata.

188
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:49,532
But he seems to have thrown it away after it was turned down.

189
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,232
Isn't that the tile picture

190
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,132
that was in the public bath that used to be here?

191
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,632
It used to be in the bath tub

192
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:57,832
and looked like there was a real carp inside.

193
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:00,639
The men's restroom. Men's restroom.

194
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,532
Conan, there you are.

195
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,832
Stay put because it's dangerous.

196
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,432
Ran. I have to go to the restroom,

197
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:11,032
but Pops is in there now.

198
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:16,655
I'm so sorry to have to trouble you like this suddenly.

199
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,532
No problem at all.

200
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,632
Thank you, director.

201
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,032
Conan, are you all right?

202
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,432
Are you all right?

203
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,132
I'm sorry that it's slippery here

204
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:30,669
since the floor's just been waxed.

205
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,732
No, not at all. We're sorry for troubling you.

206
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,432
May I buy a bottle of tea at the vending machine?

207
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,232
Sure. I don't mind the least bit.

208
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,232
Go right ahead.

209
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,685
Huh? It's tepid.

210
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,687
It's still being cooled, I guess.

211
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,132
See.

212
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:52,232
"Cooling" -That's true.

213
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:53,332
Huh?

214
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:56,695
Did the vending machine man come today?

215
00:11:56,932 --> 00:12:00,699
No. We're not doing business today because of renovations.

216
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,701
Director, could I speak to you for a minute?

217
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,703
Yes, I'll be right over.

218
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,232
I'll have to go.

219
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:09,432
Come again and visit us after we open, okay?

220
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:10,709
Sure.

221
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,132
Okay, let's head back then.

222
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,132
Hey, Conan.

223
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,232
You'll fall again, you know.

224
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,719
"Electrical room"

225
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,432
This is...

226
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:44,743
Conan. What's the matter?

227
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:45,932
Conan?

228
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,287
The fingerprints have been verified.

229
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:05,087
The prints on the knife are undoubtedly Mr. Kaneda's.

230
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,087
Good work.

231
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,773
Then, we'll have Mr. Kaneda come with us to the station.

232
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,587
Why did it turn up like this?

233
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,587
May I return to the main office?

234
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:22,787
Me, too.

235
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,783
Well then, as to both of you,

236
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,785
we'll be contacting you again if necessary.

237
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:28,787
You may go for today.

238
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,587
Thank you.

239
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:32,087
Is he going voluntarily?

240
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:35,187
I'm sorry, but could you bring the car around?

241
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:36,795
Roger, sir.

242
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,387
Officer Chiba.

243
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,487
What is it, Conan?

244
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,087
-Mr. Mouri? -Yes.

245
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:53,187
Hey, enough already.

246
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,087
I didn't do it, I tell you.

247
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:59,087
We'll hear you out, all you want at the station.

248
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,987
Dad?

249
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,987
Please wait, everyone.

250
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,487
Mr. Kaneda is not the culprit.

251
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,587
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

252
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,887
His fingerprints were also found on the knife, you know.

253
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:21,687
Besides, you even said that he was the culprit.

254
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:23,987
It's true I did say that,

255
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:27,687
but I'd like to revise all the deductions I made thus far.

256
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:31,587
The culprit is among the people here.

257
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,887
I thought it was strange

258
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,855
that the knife would be left behind at the site.

259
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,887
It's true that it's thinkable that the culprit may have dropped it.

260
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,987
But if so, what should also be here is missing.

261
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:45,787
What should also be here?

262
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,387
What is that?

263
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,867
Please take another good look

264
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,587
at where the knife was found on the ground.

265
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:55,187
Right near it is the ashtray.

266
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,687
Because of the pipes, it's totally crushed.

267
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:58,887
It smashed under the weight

268
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,879
and sunk deep into the ground.

269
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,487
That's true.

270
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:06,087
But what about the knife?

271
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:07,787
There's no sign of it being sunk in the ground.

272
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,287
Exactly.

273
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,187
It's heavy enough to kill a person.

274
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,893
Therefore, it's hard to think that

275
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,687
there is no trace of the knife having sunk deep.

276
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,487
What does that mean?

277
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,287
It was placed there by the culprit

278
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,903
after the pipes collapsed.

279
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,187
What?

280
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:27,987
Is that true?

281
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:32,911
The culprit probably stole the knife from Mr. Kaneda last night.

282
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:38,917
He used it to inconspicuously slit the back side of the band.

283
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,887
Then, he banded the pipes a bit firmly together.

284
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:44,487
After confirming that Mr. Inomata began smoking

285
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:47,987
and Mr. Kaneda left the site,

286
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:50,387
the culprit also left.

287
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,933
Didn't the culprit cut the band with the knife?

288
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,187
No. Because if he directly cut the band,

289
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:01,287
he would also be endangering himself.

290
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:04,943
That's why the culprit used a certain something to cut the band.

291
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:06,945
A certain something?

292
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,387
Please look at the next building behind me.

293
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,487
You mean the amusement facility?

294
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,487
From the window on the second floor

295
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:14,953
of the prefab of the construction site,

296
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,587
you can see the emergency door next to it, can't you?

297
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:20,987
What about it?

298
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,087
Officer Chiba.

299
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,087
From what I confirmed,

300
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,387
the window of the 2nd floor of the prefab was open

301
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,287
and it was possible to look straight at the pipes

302
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,487
from the amusement facility.

303
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,971
Don't tell me you're saying that the culprit

304
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,587
severed the band holding the pipes together from there?

305
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:37,487
No way.

306
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,987
Officer Chiba, please go ahead.

307
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,487
Yes, sir.

308
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,987
The culprit operated the breaker

309
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,687
that is on the 1st floor of that building,

310
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:48,987
made a certain something on the 2nd floor move

311
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,287
and committed the crime.

312
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:55,387
Mr. Mouri, what is that certain something?

313
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,587
This is...

314
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,587
A pitching machine?

315
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,887
Exactly.

316
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:08,087
At around noon today when the incident occurred,

317
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:11,009
the window of the prefab was open.

318
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,011
When I confirmed further,

319
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,013
the amusement facility was undergoing renovation,

320
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:18,087
so the door of the emergency door was also open.

321
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:22,787
Neither the nets nor the glass was set up yet.

322
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,287
In other words, at the time of the incident

323
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,287
from the site where the pipes

324
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,587
were to the pitching machine on the 2nd floor,

325
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:31,587
a path was formed.

326
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,987
The culprit probably set the pitching machine up beforehand

327
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:37,887
to throwing position

328
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:40,487
and turned down the breaker of the building.

329
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:43,887
After confirming that Mr. Inomata was in the smoking area,

330
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,087
he turned the breaker back on.

331
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,187
In other words, the culprit used the impact of the ball

332
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,687
going through a narrow path and made the pipes collapse

333
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:01,987
to kill Mr. Inomata.

334
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:06,287
And the culprit who committed the crime probably...

335
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:14,587
is you, Mr. Murase.

336
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,087
You...

337
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:22,787
I hope you have evidence to back up what you're saying.

338
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:24,687
The evidence is your shoe.

339
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,087
To be more exact, the sole of your shoe.

340
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,687
Ran, show me the sole of your shoe.

341
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,687
What? Mine?

342
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,587
Okay.

343
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:38,587
What's this red yarn?

344
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:42,387
It's the yarn from the rug of the amusement facility, Funfun.

345
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,987
If the same thing found on Ran's shoe

346
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,787
is found on the sole of Mr. Murase's shoe,

347
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:49,787
it would be evidence that he went to Funfun.

348
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:52,587
Excuse me, but will you show it to me?

349
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,387
It's there.

350
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:59,117
But this is only circumstantial evidence, isn't it?

351
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,587
I won't have a mere yarn making me as a culprit.

352
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:04,687
It's natural that there's no concrete evidence.

353
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:08,487
However, it's certain that the trace of a ball was found,

354
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:11,587
together with the prints of Mr. Murase's shoes.

355
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,787
After running over to the scene of the crime,

356
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,987
you hid the ball that is evidence, didn't you?

357
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,887
Where's that proof?

358
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,487
Probably inside that debris?

359
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:25,143
After all, Mr. Murase hasn't gone off the premises at all.

360
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,587
Officer Takagi.

361
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:27,987
Yes, sir.

362
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,187
I found it.

363
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,087
This is it, right?

364
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:42,087
Why would Mr. Murase want to kill Mr. Inomata?

365
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:45,787
Because your concept was turned down?

366
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:47,787
Wrong.

367
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,787
It's because...

368
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,787
I hated Inomata.

369
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,173
Up until now,

370
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,187
he bought up land cheaply using ruthless methods.

371
00:19:58,187 --> 00:19:59,687
He established a large scale chain

372
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,787
of multi-purpose bathing facilities.

373
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,087
Among one of the lands that he bought at an extremely cheap price

374
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:07,987
was my parental home's public bath house.

375
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:12,587
My mother fell ill because of this and died.

376
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:16,787
My father committed suicide as if going after her.

377
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,487
But I didn't do it because I hated him for that.

378
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,887
I found out that this construction site

379
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,987
was once a public bathing house

380
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:28,287
and built in an architectural concept

381
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,209
hoping to at least leave a slight trace of what it used to be.

382
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:33,211
But he...

383
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:38,387
He snickered saying that public bathing houses were out of date.

384
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,487
He remarked that there was no need

385
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:44,787
for such old fashioned and moldy things anymore.

386
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,987
He called me names.

387
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,587
A lot of memories...

388
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:58,387
of my Dad and I are packed in the public bathing house.

389
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:02,687
All those memories, he had the nerve to...

390
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,251
That's why I killed him!

391
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,687
All my precious memories,

392
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,487
he stepped all over them and crushed them.

393
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,687
That's why I killed Inomata.

394
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,787
Mr. Murase.

395
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:25,787
It's not that I don't understand how you feel.

396
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,087
However,

397
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:32,487
just because he stepped all over your memories and crushed them,

398
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:36,987
it doesn't give you the right to kill anyone.

399
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:38,687
Besides, Mr. Murase,

400
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,987
Mr. Inomata also has a family

401
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:44,487
and I'm sure they had precious memories, too.

402
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:48,787
You destroyed their memories, you know.

403
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,087
Dad, hang in there!

404
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:22,487
Shut up!

405
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,687
I'm trying to concentrate.

406
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:29,987
I'll show you my ultra super technique now.

407
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,387
My hips!

408
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,887
It sure is an ultra super technique all right.

409
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,958
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,700
"Cleaning robot"

411
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:53,411
Appetite, sports and maple leaves bring to mind.

412
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,420
-Beer! -Autumn, you idiot.
