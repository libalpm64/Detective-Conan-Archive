1
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:05,716
Rikumichi Kusuda a member of the Black Organization

2
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:09,216
that snuck into the hospital where Rena Mizunashi is hospitalized...

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,216
commits suicide after being pursued by agent Akai and I.

4
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,416
Agent Akai declares that since if Kusuda was able to make contact,

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,616
the Organization would single out this hospital.

6
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:24,316
The FBI works out remedial measures.

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,916
But, there are many patients

8
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,916
who cannot move from here, you know?

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,816
We can't just do nothing and wait

10
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,016
when we know that the guys of the Organization

11
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:36,015
will be raiding this place.

12
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,616
We're not just going to wait,

13
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:38,816
we're pulling out.

14
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:40,616
Pulling out?

15
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,716
You mean we're leaving her behind and pulling out?

16
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,023
No.

17
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,716
We're pulling out the strings and waiting.

18
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,816
Let's meet our enemy,

19
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,316
the black wolves who've come

20
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:55,116
to retrieve their straying colleague?

21
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:56,816
We find out that agent Akai had in the past

22
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:59,316
snuck into the Black Organization

23
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:03,316
and became the boyfriend of Haibara's older sister, Akemi Miyano.

24
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:11,016
Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job,

25
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:15,016
will you go out with me as my real boyfriend?

26
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,716
"Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job"

27
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,416
"will you go out with me as my real boyfriend? Akemi"

28
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:28,067
Hey.

29
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,516
May I talk to you for a while?

30
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,616
If you're thinking of the strategy to counter-attack them,

31
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,916
I'm still thinking about it.

32
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:39,016
But, I was looking at you,

33
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,616
and thought that maybe you're thinking exactly

34
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:43,416
what I'm thinking.

35
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,616
In the meantime,

36
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:54,093
Eisuke Hondo who is searching for the whereabouts of his older sister,

37
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:57,216
tracks down Rena Mizunashi's room.

38
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:02,616
Hey, get up, Rena Mizunashi.

39
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,105
If you don't wake up,

40
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:10,109
I can't ask you how my older sister Hidemi is doing!

41
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:12,416
Hey, get up! Please get up!

42
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,816
You're going to be taken somewhere again, aren't you?

43
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,115
Before that happens!

44
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:17,416
Please open your eyes!

45
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,916
Hey!

46
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:24,116
I'm telling you, open your eyes!

47
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,129
No, Ei-chan.

48
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:36,135
Oh, wait.

49
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,137
Are you one of the agents that have been summoned here?

50
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:40,716
Oh, yes.

51
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,516
I'm Andre Camel.

52
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,916
I just happened to get a call from my wife.

53
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,016
Then, please hang up quickly.

54
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,416
We're having a strategy meeting.

55
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,416
Yes, just as planned.

56
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,816
You never fail to surprise me, sonny.

57
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,816
I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Akai.

58
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:21,716
Thank god we've got you too, sonny.

59
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,016
And what now, Mr. Akai?

60
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:41,316
You think...

61
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,516
we should take on the risk?

62
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:53,816
Are you willing to try it?

63
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,231
Sizzling hot suspense.

64
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,916
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

65
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,916
Abnormal incidents occur everywhere.

66
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,916
Every incident leads to the hospital.

67
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,239
He sees through the one and only truth.

68
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,241
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

69
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,016
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

70
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:58,004
"Red and Black Crash: Confusion"

71
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:01,004
We got ready three stretchers for moving patients

72
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:04,343
as well as three vehicles we could load the stretchers onto.

73
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:05,504
If worse comes to worse,

74
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:06,604
we were going to use these

75
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,347
to confuse the guys of the Organization,

76
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,104
while we attempt to take Rena Mizunashi

77
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,351
out of this hospital and flee.

78
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,704
It's a strategy that we would most like to avoid using though.

79
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,357
Any questions?

80
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,359
May I?

81
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,004
And about communication methods,

82
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:24,363
we can't use the cell phone or the wireless, is that right?

83
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,104
No, this is a hospital,

84
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:28,367
so please try to avoid using electronic devices,

85
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,369
they may interfere with medical equipment.

86
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,104
Cell phones are easy to tap, besides.

87
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,904
If anything comes up,

88
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,404
notify the leader of your block verbally.

89
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:38,904
Leaders, go outside to the parking lot

90
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,104
and notify James who is waiting there,

91
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,704
by wireless and get orders from him.

92
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,404
Talk about tedious.

93
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:51,504
Playing a telephone game like that,

94
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:55,404
is like giving them a chance to get what they want.

95
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:58,397
If all preparation for escape is ready,

96
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:02,401
I think it would be way better to move her out now.

97
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:06,004
No, that would be the last resort.

98
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:09,804
It's too dangerous to make a move from our side

99
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,104
when those guys still don't know where is Rena Mizunashi's room.

100
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,413
The guys of the Organization are probably keeping their eyes wide open

101
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:18,004
for cars that come out of the hospital.

102
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,104
Judging from the fact that the car of the guy Kusuda

103
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,204
secretly had a heat detecting thermography equipped to it,

104
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,104
it's likely that they'll discover which is our car

105
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,427
from the number of people in the car,

106
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:31,604
thus making the FBI targets for their snipers.

107
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:37,204
Then, we'd have to flee through the shower of their bullets.

108
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:39,104
But, I wonder about not being able to make contact

109
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,204
during an emergency.

110
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:43,704
Of course in such case,

111
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:46,004
call me directly on the wireless.

112
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:47,804
I'll leave it to your discretion.

113
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:48,904
Yes, sir...

114
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:52,451
Well, I don't think they'll make a grand entrance,

115
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,004
arming themselves with guns and machine guns,

116
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,804
because they don't want the world to know that they exist.

117
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,404
Right, I agree.

118
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:04,004
They approach like a shadow

119
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,804
and vanish like a fog.

120
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:10,469
That's how they usually do their job.

121
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:11,704
Hey...

122
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,304
where were you?

123
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:15,104
The strategy meeting is over.

124
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,475
No problem.

125
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,804
With the three stretchers

126
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,804
and the three vans that are parked at the parking lot,

127
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:24,483
I already know the strategy.

128
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,804
I wouldn't call it a great strategy,

129
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,487
but I knew it was coming.

130
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,489
Right, sonny?

131
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:31,904
Yep!

132
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,404
What... what's with you two?

133
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,804
Besides, Conan...

134
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,504
isn't it time you head on home?

135
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:43,904
I'll be just fine.

136
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:46,904
I told everybody that I'll be sleeping over at Doc's tonight.

137
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:49,204
And I also took a cat nap.

138
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:50,509
Really...

139
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,204
Okay then.

140
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:54,513
I'll go stand in position for now.

141
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,404
But, please let me know

142
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,519
if you plan to split from here.

143
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,525
I'm pretty confident about my driving technique.

144
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
Hey, Shu.

145
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,004
Doesn't that guy look familiar?

146
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:12,304
Huh?

147
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:13,804
He's among the additional agents

148
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,604
that were dispatched.

149
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:17,204
Well...

150
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:19,404
I'm not sure of the faces of people on our side.

151
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,543
I never forget the faces of my enemies though.

152
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,904
I guess it's only natural that he looks familiar.

153
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,549
After all he's an FBI agent just like us.

154
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:31,804
Yes.

155
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,704
But, when I look at him,

156
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,304
it makes me feel uneasy.

157
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,104
Hey... are you okay?

158
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:49,304
Yeah.

159
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,204
I see that you haven't been sleeping much.

160
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,104
You've got black circles around your eyes.

161
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,104
No, he always had them.

162
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:57,204
Well, I'll go get a breath of fresh air

163
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:59,004
while I patrol the area.

164
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:00,204
Yeah.

165
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,504
Maybe Shu is getting too personally involved in this

166
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,504
because of his girlfriend who was killed.

167
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,404
No, in his case,

168
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:12,004
the more involved he is the better.

169
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,604
Akai who had been in that Organization before

170
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:17,104
and is aware of their way of doing things,

171
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,104
is an arch enemy

172
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:21,604
that they had tried to get rid of time and again.

173
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:26,104
For we, the FBI, he's an absolute ace is the hole.

175
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:40,619
Sir?

176
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:43,804
Has something happened?

177
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:46,625
My stomach suddenly...

178
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:51,504
I'm sorry, same here...

179
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:53,204
The Tohto Kanjo outward track train

will be arriving at platform number four.

181
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:58,004
Please stand behind the white line to prevent accidents.

182
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:01,904
My throat...

183
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:04,404
-My eyes... -Don't you smell something strange?

184
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:06,304
Station master, please call an ambulance!

185
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:07,304
Okay!

"Yoko Okino starring in Kiss Note"

187

I've got to get that notebook back as soon as possible

188
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,604
or else everybody's heart will be broken.

189
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:17,304
A fire has broken out.

190
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:19,104
Please obey instructions from the person in charge.

191
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:20,404
-No joke... -Give me a break?

192
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,204
Fire!

193
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,673
Huh? Mr. James Black?

194
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,504
There's no such patient by the name here.

195
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,104
No, I heard that he's not a patient here,

196
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:41,504
but a helper accompanying a patient...

197
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,904
I know him.

198
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,685
Oh, yes! Here's a delivery for him!

199
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,404
Who is it from? And what is it?

200
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,004
That...

201
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,504
The sender is...

202
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,004
It's from a Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda.

203
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,104
Rikumichi Kususda?

204
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,604
Yes, it's from a Mr. Kusuda,

205
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:06,204
and this is the delivery.

206
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:09,804
Flower?

207
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,304
A Columbine.

208
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:14,713
It's called Odamaki in Japanese.

209
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,004
The Organization sent this to me?

210
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:19,704
Yes. They used the name of one of their members

211
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:23,104
who committed suicide last night as the sender,

212
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:24,504
so there's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:26,725
Our agents are disguised as security officers

214
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,404
and checking the bags of everyone entering the hospital,

215
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:32,004
we even checked delivery packages.

216
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:34,733
Why would they send me a flower like this?

217
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,504
This Columbine is the state flower of Colorado.

218
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:39,804
It means getting hold of something for sure.

219
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:42,004
In the language of flowers that what it means.

220
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:45,604
It has another meaning which is determined to win too.

221
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:48,304
Declaration of war.

222
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:49,804
Right?

223
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,104
Yeah, I guess so.

224
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:54,753
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

225
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,204
We're at the hospital now!

226
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:02,004
I wonder if they're victims of the fire that we just saw a while ago.

227
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:05,604
This is Maiya calling from the front entrance!

228
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:07,704
James Black here! Is something wrong?

229
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:12,504
So many ill patients and others are flooding the hospital!

230
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,204
I can't check them all!

231
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,904
What?

232
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:33,907
According to the wounded,

233
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,607
it seems that three different incidents

234
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,607
occurred in this vicinity at almost the same time.

235
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,507
Three incidents happened simultaneously?

236
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:41,807
Yes, group food poisoning,

237
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:44,307
bad odor chaos, and a break out of fire!

238
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:45,907
The Organization's done it?

239
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:47,907
The bad odor chaos and fire

240
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,007
can deliberately be caused at the same time,

241
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,707
but the incubation period for food poisoning

242
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,107
differs from person to person.

243
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:55,807
They probably used some kind of poisoning

244
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,707
that would result in a similar symptom.

245
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,407
Just like the other two cases,

246
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:02,307
their purpose is to come up with a lot of victims

247
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:03,707
without having to kill any of them,

248
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:06,107
but have them crowding over to this hospital.

249
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:09,707
Moreover, after excluding those with surface injuries

250
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:12,107
such as burns or cuts,

251
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:15,407
it's still difficult to determine

252
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:18,407
who is faking pain in their stomach, throat and eyes.

253
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:22,007
In other words, it's easy to make a large number of their members

254
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:25,807
sneak into the hospital.

255
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,807
Their purpose is to find

256
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,607
which room Rena Mizunashi is in.

257
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:34,853
If they use sheer force of numbers to look around for her,

258
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,207
they'll probably do it in no time at all.

259
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,207
No.

260
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,507
Not possible.

261
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:42,861
-Huh? -If they send in that many members

262
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,507
and start suspicious movement like that,

263
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:48,207
the number of members who would get caught

264
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,869
by the FBI may skyrocket.

265
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,907
They're not people who would risk doing something like that.

266
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,507
Then, what's all this racket for?

267
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:59,507
Yeah, they're probably after something else.

268
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,907
Hey, did you hear something just then?

269
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,107
That planter.

270
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,707
Huh...

271
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,507
Besides, the sound seems to be...

272
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:21,807
getting louder and louder.

273
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,607
Now that he mentioned it, very true.

274
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,907
Put in on the floor slowly and pull away from it.

275
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,707
Bomb?

276
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,007
Didn't you check inside the planter?

277
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,507
I... I'm sorry.

278
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:14,407
I was distracted by the flower. Besides...

279
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,607
Setting a bomb to this planter

280
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:20,307
would only succeed in killing a few agents.

281
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:22,961
If the Japanese police come here because of a bomb explodes,

282
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,807
searching for Rena Mizunashi would be difficult.

283
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,607
They could gain nothing from it.

284
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:29,907
That's what you thought, right?

285
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:30,969
Yes.

286
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,607
At any rate, we've got to do something about that bomb.

287
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,407
It looks to be full of traps

288
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,977
and it may take some time disassembling it.

289
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,607
So, I think it would be safer to take it to a place

290
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:43,507
where there're no people and dispose of it.

291
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:46,407
If this time is correct,

292
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:50,507
there is 31 minutes and 14 seconds to go.

293
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:53,007
Okay, Akai, we're counting on you.

294
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:56,207
-Okay. -No, you stay here, Shu.

295
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:57,507
I'll go.

296
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,707
There's a trash dump seven kilometers from here,

297
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:01,707
so I'll drive over there.

298
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:05,003
Use my car, then.

299
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:10,107
I wonder if you can get there in time?

300
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:12,507
Because three incidents happened at once,

301
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:15,007
all the major roads are jammed.

302
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,507
Getting there in 30 minutes isn't going to be easy.

303
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,507
Well, if you were to take a navigator

304
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,807
who knows the roads in this vicinity,

305
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,907
it would be a different story, though.

306
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:25,023
Hey you!

307
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,307
What do you think you're doing leaving your post?

308
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,307
I heard about the terrible traffic jam

309
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,029
from the people who came to this hospital,

310
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,031
so I came to report it to you.

311
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,607
I happen to be posted close by,

312
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:38,807
so I thought it was faster to directly report it myself.

313
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,039
We have no time to waste talking!

314
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,807
You two both go and take care of the bomb!

315
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,043
Roger...

316
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,507
Something bothers me.

317
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,047
Huh? You mean Camel?

318
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,207
It's true he doesn't have the most amiable looks.

319
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,807
No, I mean the bomb.

320
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,407
It was set deliberately, so that the time indicator would show,

321
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,707
and moreover rigged so that it would gradually get louder.

322
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,807
It's as if they wanted us to find the bomb.

323
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:07,065
Also, isn't it strange that they gave us more than 30 minutes?

324
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,507
It's as if they set the time ahead,

325
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:15,073
so that the FBI agents would take the bomb elsewhere to explode.

326
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,507
Then, what the heck is that bomb for?

327
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:20,107
I wonder what they're after?

328
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:31,907
Hey! Are you really sure

329
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,107
that this is the short cut to the trash dump?

330
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:36,007
How strange.

331
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:39,507
This was completely empty two years ago.

332
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:41,099
Two years ago?

333
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,407
By the way, is there a clock

334
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,807
or something in the trunk behind?

335
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:48,407
The noisy ticking has been bugging me for some time now.

336
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,007
What? Oh God!

337
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:51,607
Why didn't you hurry up and say so?

338
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:59,807
Hey! There's no clock in here!

339
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:02,707
Hey! Did you really hear something like that?

340
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,907
-He's gone? -You'd better hurry inside

341
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,125
or I'm going to leave you behind.

342
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:14,007
Why are you sitting in the driver's seat?

343
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:17,407
It's too much trouble trying to verbally explain the back roads.

344
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,007
And I've got better driving skills.

345
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:24,007
Besides, we don't seem to have much time left either.

346
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:27,507
So, you lied to me about the clock in the trunk?

347
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:29,807
Yes, circumstances may justify a lie.

348
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:33,607
Hey... just what do you think you're doing?

349
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,153
Hang on tight!

350
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,007
Hey?

351
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:38,807
Hey...

352
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:55,173
Hey! The trash dump is in the direction opposite from here!

353
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,107
I've given up going there

354
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,175
because there's no time left.

355
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,307
Huh?

356
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:01,207
All we need is an unoccupied place, right?

357
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,207
Quick, will you examine her?

358
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,107
You idiot! We were here first!

359
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,607
There are a lot of deliverymen around.

360
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,707
Yeah, there sure are a lot of them.

361
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:18,307
What shall I do...

362
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,507
Sorry.

363
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,607
Excuse me.

364
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,507
Kusuda...

365
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,707
Rikumichi Kusuda.

366
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:35,207
Jodie, is everything okay on your side?

367
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:37,007
It's about time the bomb explodes.

368
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,807
Well...

369
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:41,219
Agent Camel forced me off the wheels and he's driving now...

370
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,227
What're you doing by opening the roof?

371
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,007
-The wheels... -What?

372
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,907
Steer please!

373
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:55,007
What?

374
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,007
Hey!

375
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,707
What was that sound just now?

376
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,707
Jodie?

377
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:15,253
Yes, sir. The bomb was gotten rid of just now.

378
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:18,107
Good work, Jodie.

379
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:19,257
Oh, no.

380
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:21,707
Agent Camel is the one who should be given credit for it.

381
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:23,707
I hate to think what would have happened

382
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:24,907
without his driving technique.

383
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:28,807
By the way, how are things over there?

384
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:33,271
Akai and Conan found a clue

385
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,407
as to what the Organization is up to doing.

386
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:37,275
Yes?

387
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,277
Excuse me, I'm a security officer.

388
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:42,607
I'm sure the nurse brought you a delivery just now.

389
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,707
Oh, yes, this is it.

390
00:21:44,707 --> 00:21:46,807
Isn't it from a person named Kusuda?

391
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:51,289
Yes, but I don't know anyone by that name.

392
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,707
Excuse me.

393
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,107
It's a bomb after all.

394
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:05,107
What is that?

395
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,707
It's a wiretap.

396
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:12,507
A new type of fraud is widespread nowadays using this device.

397
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,207
A Bomb?

398
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,107
The contents of the get well gift

399
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:17,315
was a bomb after all?

400
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:18,607
Yes.

401
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:20,107
This plastic bomb alone

402
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:23,907
is only capable of blowing up one room.

403
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,707
But if several of these go off together...

404
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,807
This hospital will unmistakably collapse.

405
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,423
Driving Technique.

407
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,720
March 3rd is Ear Day.

408
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,427
-It's Girl's Day. -Goldfish Day.

409
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,020
Oh, really?
