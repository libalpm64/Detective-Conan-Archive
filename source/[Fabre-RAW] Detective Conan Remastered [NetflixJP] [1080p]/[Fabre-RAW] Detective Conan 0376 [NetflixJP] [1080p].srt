1
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:24,588
Today, everyone encounters a real pinch.

2
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,088
The tent is mistaken for another.

3
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:27,888
And Ran encounters an unexpected pinch!

4
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,388
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:31,188
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:33,288
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:05,244
"We're going driving, driving."

8
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:07,644
It's hard to believe it was raining so hard yesterday!

9
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:10,044
True, not even a cloud is in sight.

10
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:15,144
I guess this is what you call a passing typhoon.

11
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,844
Did you finish reading it?

12
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,544
It was so interesting I stayed up all night reading it.

13
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,544
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

14
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,744
"Sleeping Princess in a Pinch"?

15
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:37,344
Yes. It's a story about many men trying to wake a princess

16
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:40,144
who has been asleep for many years.

17
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:43,144
The one who succeeds in waking her up gets to marry her.

18
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,144
How romantic.

19
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,644
Well, but she wouldn't be alive if she were sleeping for so many years.

20
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:53,844
If she gets nutrition through intravenous drip, she'll be fine.

21
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:56,644
I'll bet she just pretended to be asleep all the while, right?

22
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,144
Because no man of her choice happen to come by.

23
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,544
Conan, did you read the book?

24
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,444
You're spoiling my dream.

25
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:14,044
"Time Limit is 15:00"

26
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,544
Let's take the best place.

27
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,844
Under the tree has been taken.

28
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,844
That's the only place with a shade.

29
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,944
All set.

30
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:42,044
"Shoji Horikoshi (20)" -Misa, can you get that peg over there for me?

31
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:44,044
"Misa Tsuneyama (19)" -Huh? Peg...

32
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:45,044
What?

33
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,544
That little stick to poke into the ground.

34
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,044
That one.

35
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:52,744
Why don't you say so in the first place?

36
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,844
After all, this is the first time I've come camping.

37
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,644
Sorry, sorry.

38
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,644
Never mind, I'll get it myself.

39
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:01,544
By the way, why do we have to stay in such a cheap tent.

40
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:04,144
Couldn't you get something like that? You see, like that!

41
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,444
There are no such rental tents.

42
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:10,144
That's why I'm asking you why our tent is a rented one?

43
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,544
Why didn't you go out and buy one?

44
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,444
If you're going to bring me to camp, isn't that plain common sense?

45
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:19,044
Go and buy one right this minute.

46
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:22,244
She's super unreal, that lady.

47
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,344
You know I can't do that.

48
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:26,444
Let's go to a pension then!

49
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:28,844
I don't like this tent.

50
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:32,744
What? I brought you to camp because I wanted to show you

51
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,044
how enjoyable it would be!

52
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:35,744
Seems like we've got guests already.

53
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,844
We've got no choice,

54
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,044
so why don't we set it up somewhere around here.

55
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,944
Okay, hurry! Let's go get the rental tents!

56
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:52,844
All done!

57
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:57,544
Okay, let's set up the tent for the girls on that side next.

58
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:00,044
Hey, wait up!

59
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:02,244
No! I can't take this anymore.

60
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:05,144
Don't be like that, Misa.

61
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,844
I'm really going home.

62
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:07,844
Misa!

63
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:13,244
All right, it seems that they're leaving.

64
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:15,444
How lucky! Hurry, let's go, Conan!

65
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,444
Slave driver.

66
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,344
You really set it up fast this time.

67
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:24,544
Yes. The second time around is easy.

68
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:31,744
Don't push yourself. Maybe you should sleep for a while?

69
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,344
I'm fine.

70
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:36,344
I'll stick it out until I finish making the curry,

71
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,944
because I'll bet you're all hungry, right?

72
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:45,544
Hey, what's going on here?

73
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,844
How come there's a tent standing in our place?

74
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:50,144
This is our place.

75
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:55,744
You said you were leaving, didn't you?

76
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:56,944
Miss.

77
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:59,444
You did say so, didn't you?

78
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,244
Well, I guess I did.

79
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,644
You changed your mind.

80
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:08,544
Hey, what's this? No joke.

81
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:10,444
This is our place!

82
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:13,044
But we already put up our tent.

83
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,344
I just went to exchange the tent

84
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,444
because there was a hole in the one I just got.

85
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:21,044
Get on with it and move your tents out of the way!

86
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:23,644
Okay, let's clear the tent out of the way.

87
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:29,044
Well, it is a fact that they were here first.

88
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,444
Okay, so hurry on and get it out of the way.

89
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:41,244
You can leave it as is.

90
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,244
Huh? What do you think you're saying, Misa?

91
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,344
They're saying they're going to move, you know.

92
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:48,444
We can set the tent up somewhere around there.

93
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,244
This is the best place there is,

94
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,044
right under this tree!

95
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:56,744
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,172
Darn it!

97
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,772
You should cut it into smaller pieces.

98
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,072
Huh?

99
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,772
When you make curry at home,

100
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,872
you can spend a long time boiling the contents.

101
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,872
But you can't do that here, right?

102
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:24,472
You seem used to this.

103
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:26,172
Here let me do it.

104
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:29,272
I may not look it, but I'm pretty much a homemaker, too.

105
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,472
Amazing!

106
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,172
What happened to your boyfriend?

107
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:41,872
Who cares?

108
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,372
Huh?

109
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:44,572
It's over with us.

110
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:52,072
Women can sense things like this.

111
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:57,572
I guess this is it.

112
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,372
Just great.

113
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:01,872
They sure have everything here.

114
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,172
These recent camping grounds.

115
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:05,572
Yes.

116
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:31,072
Oh, I wonder if she already woke up?

117
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:40,872
Somebody!

118
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:43,072
Somebody, come quick!

119
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:48,172
-What seems to be the matter? -Ran was kidnapped!

120
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,572
My God!

121
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:55,372
-Ran! -Ran!

122
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:58,272
Darn it, where did that guy go?

123
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,772
They're not over here!

124
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,972
Darn it! Why'd he take Ran?

125
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:15,372
Ran!

126
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,372
Conan!

127
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,272
I wonder who he is?

128
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:41,972
There is a smell of a drug inside.

129
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,672
It seems she was put to sleep with a drug.

130
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:48,672
The car that fled was reported to be a stolen car,

131
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,072
so I'm sure we'll be able to find it right away.

132
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,272
I sure hope so.

133
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:57,272
The point is why the culprit kidnapped Ran.

134
00:09:57,272 --> 00:10:00,972
There are so many other people on this camping ground, and yet...

135
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:03,372
What a thing to say! How irresponsible!

136
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,972
You're the one who said you wanted to stay over at a pension,

137
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,272
so let's hurry up and head over.

138
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,772
A friend of the people we got to know on the camping ground was kidnapped!

139
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:11,072
I can't just leave.

140
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,372
Misa, this has nothing to do with us.

141
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,672
Yes, it does.

142
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,872
He's still breathing!

143
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:33,472
Is this the sneaker that the man who kidnapped Ran was wearing?

144
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:34,772
No doubt about it.

145
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:36,772
It's the same as the one the man was wearing.

146
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,072
Which means that you caught the kidnapper?

147
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:42,672
A car fell over a cliff near here.

148
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:45,872
This is the shoe that the driver of the car was wearing.

149
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,372
His unconscious and in the hospital now.

150
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:50,472
Then, Ran...

151
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,972
Doc, what about Ran?

152
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:54,272
I don't know about Ran.

153
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:58,272
The car was a regular sedan and Ran was nowhere in sight.

154
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:00,272
We found from his driver's license

155
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:02,872
that he is Masayuki Takada, age 25.

156
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,872
There seems to have been a half-written mail that hasn't been sent out,

157
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,672
hinting that he had committed the crime left on his cell phone.

158
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:11,272
The police seem to have concluded that the accident was caused

159
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:14,372
probably because he was keying in mail while driving.

160
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:16,072
And, what about that mail?

161
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:19,972
He seems to have an accomplice.

162
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,772
I guess Takada was the one who carried out the crime for somebody else.

163
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:26,872
There seems to be another file.

164
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:28,572
Doc, will you lend it to me?

165
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,872
Sneaker.

166
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,972
This is rubber boots used when fishing.

167
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:40,072
Why's this thing here?

168
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:43,172
Ran? No, it's not.

169
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:01,572
I see! The tent.

170
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:03,772
It's the tent!

171
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,087
If you insist on going home just like that,

172
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,187
I swear I'll despise you forever.

173
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:14,487
Go ahead and suit yourself.

174
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:18,287
I don't intend to stick around with a stuck up like you for life.

175
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:22,187
I'm nothing more to you than some slave to humor you,

176
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,887
so I'm done with you.

177
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,287
Why didn't you answer the call?

178
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:30,887
I've tried calling you many times.

179
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,987
You kidnapped the wrong woman.

180
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:41,887
Masayuki Takada is hospitalized now because of the car accident.

181
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,687
The police called from his cell phone.

182
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:47,187
Hey! Where's Ran?

183
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:49,987
I don't know. I don't know.

184
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,287
I asked Takada to get the woman who was in the tent under that tree.

185
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,187
But thanks to a small mistake,

186
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:03,787
the place was taken by someone else.

187
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:05,587
I tried to contact him about it,

188
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,987
but Takada had his cell phone turned off.

189
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,687
This picture is pretty blurred.

190
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,887
Depending on how you look at it, it sort of looks like Ran.

191
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:16,587
What's your connection with Takada?

192
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,087
One morning at a certain station,

193
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:22,687
I saw the man called Takada, kick a man onto the railroad.

194
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,987
I reflexively followed Takada

195
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,187
and made sure that I could contact him.

196
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:35,187
Several days later, when I asked him to kill Misa,

197
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:37,487
he didn't refuse

198
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,787
because I told him I'd pay him 1,000,000 yen.

199
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,087
Why'd you want to do such a thing to Misa?

200
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,787
She was in the way.

201
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:47,487
I couldn't live my own way.

202
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:51,887
She's selfish, extravagant and to top it off, a busy-body.

203
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,387
I just couldn't call it off with her.

204
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:58,287
I wasn't going waste my life just for her.

205
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,587
That's for Misa to say.

206
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,987
You're the pits.

207
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:05,287
I don't mind you holding a grudge against me.

208
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:08,287
But I won't ever forgive you for endanger the life of someone

209
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:09,687
that has nothing to do with us.

210
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,487
Where is she?

211
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:14,287
Beats me. She may already be dead.

212
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,287
I know that Ran's alive.

213
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,887
Conan.

214
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:25,487
At least until 15:00.

215
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:28,287
Written on the mail that wasn't sent out,

216
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,387
it said, the woman dies at 15:00.

217
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,987
Let's go look for her.

218
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,987
We've only got 30 minutes!

219
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,587
Let's hurry!

220
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,887
Shall we go then?

221
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,787
We'll hear you out at the station.

222
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,287
Why are we looking by the river?

223
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,787
The executor of the crime, Takada,

224
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,887
had long rubber boots used for fishing.

225
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,387
It was approximately 40 minutes from the time

226
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,787
when he kidnapped Ran to when he had the accident.

227
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,587
They couldn't have gone far.

228
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:58,687
Right.

229
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:00,587
In the mean time, he changed cars

230
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:03,687
and wear long rubber boots that went up to his chest.

231
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:04,987
It has to be somewhere around here.

232
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,387
20 minutes to go.

233
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:13,687
If Takada changed cars, Ran is probably left as is.

234
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,387
Let's look for the 4WD!

235
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:17,987
Okay...

236
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,587
Don't do anything reckless.

237
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,087
Let me know when you find her!

238
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:38,787
Where on earth are you, Ran?

239
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,487
A dam?

240
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,187
The reservoir lake of the dam.

241
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,987
Doc, the dam!

242
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:50,187
Let's search the reservoir of the dam.

243
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:52,887
All right.

244
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,487
But there isn't enough time so I'll go.

245
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,187
"Drainage Alert"

246
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,487
The water's going to be discharge!

247
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:29,587
So this was what 15:00 that was written in Takada's mail meant.

248
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,087
I got it.

249
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,987
It's where the water will be released and the car will sink!

250
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:37,687
Doc! Doc!

251
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,587
No good, I can't get through.

252
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,287
Look at that!

253
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,487
There's moss on it.

254
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,487
Which means that water level will come to that point.

255
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,487
Even cars will sink.

256
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,687
There it is!

257
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,287
No joke!

258
00:16:58,287 --> 00:16:59,587
Conan!

259
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,587
You guys stay here!

260
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,087
Stay right there.

261
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,287
Ran. Thank goodness.

262
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:24,587
No good, it's locked.

263
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:28,587
Let's try cracking the glass with this.

264
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,387
It's so hard.

265
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:42,987
Execute periodic water discharge!

266
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:43,987
Roger!

267
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,087
What's with this siren?

268
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:53,887
No, don't tell me that...

269
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:11,187
All right!

270
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:15,587
Ran, wake up! Get up!

271
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:22,187
The alarm...

272
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,887
Stopped.

273
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,087
Looks bad, Conan!

274
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,287
It seems like the water level is rising!

275
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,987
Both of you go back.

276
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,687
-But... -Never mind.

277
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,487
Just leave everything to me and go.

278
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,687
Hey, wait up!

279
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,187
Just what do you think you're doing?

280
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,987
This is an authorized personnel only zone!

281
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,187
I'm fully aware of that.

282
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:20,587
The riverbank. The children are at the riverbank.

283
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,987
Stop the water!

284
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,487
What?

285
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,187
Conan!

286
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:37,387
I've got only one chance to try and make an escape.

287
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:54,987
Conan's really in trouble.

288
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,287
It's dangerous here, too. Let's go up the bank!

289
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,587
-Conan! -Conan!

290
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,287
Now!

291
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,487
Genta, catch this!

292
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:29,787
Okay, leave it to me!

293
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,887
Okay, everybody. Pull!

294
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,687
Okay! Leave it to me.

295
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:54,687
-Okay! -Okay!

296
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:09,387
Are all of you all right?

297
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,987
Conan.

298
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:14,487
-Conan. -Conan.

299
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,887
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,687
It's all because of me.

301
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:20,887
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:23,187
I guess I really overslept.

303
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:25,687
I'd like some curry, too.

304
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,787
What's wrong everybody?

305
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:32,187
Nothing. We're just tired.

306
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,887
Where is Conan?

307
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:37,987
He's exhausted and asleep in the boy's tent.

308
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:41,787
He's always like that.

309
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,287
He doesn't think of what happens

310
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:47,487
after he exhausts himself playing and sacks out.

311
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:49,587
Oh, well...

312
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:53,387
Why am I wearing pajamas?

313
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,887
How come? How embarrassing.

314
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,187
Hey.

315
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:34,314
Next Conan's Hint:

316
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:36,314
"Mirrored image"

317
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:38,714
-In the next episode... -I'll tell only you about it, Conan.

318
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:40,414
The fact is I...

319
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,118
Huh?
