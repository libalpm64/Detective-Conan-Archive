1
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:05,985
A new tragedy occurs at the House of Death.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,508
Mr. Shusaku Akashi,

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,708
husband of Aoi who passed away three year ago

4
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,993
was confined to a room and starved to death.

5
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:15,995
Just before his death,

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,999
Mr. Akashi had painted the wall on one side of the room entirely red.

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,308
What on earth did he want to relay?

8
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:27,308
Just when questioning of the former residents of the house began,

9
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:32,308
one of them, musician Shiro Naoki, is murdered.

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,808
Like Mr. Akashi, he was found sitting on a chair

11
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:38,508
facing the wall that was painted entirely red.

12
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:41,408
Inspector Morofushi, who used to be one of Aoi's classmates,

13
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:45,008
despite the warning of another classmate, Inspector Yamato,

14
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,008
goes off to investigate on his own.

15
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,908
A text mail comes from Inspector Morofushi,

16
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:53,408
and written is the sentence,

17
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,808
Koume dies.

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,608
The House of Death is enveloped in flames.

19
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:03,508
Although Inspector Morofushi is rescued from the fire

20
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:05,108
by Officer Uehara in the nick of time,

21
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,508
Inspector Morofushi is unconscious due to a blow on his head.

22
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,049
The meaning of the sentence, Koume dies, is still unknown,

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,008
the mystery of the case seemed unfathomable.

24
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:15,208
However, Ran's casual remark

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,057
drops a ray of light onto the mystery.

26
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,208
It is...

27
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,808
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

28
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,208
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

29
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,208
We're finally approaching the climax.

30
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,408
It's time to unravel the mystery of the red wall and real killer.

31
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,108
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,808
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:35,408
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,504
I get it!

35
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,185
Just looking at this red wall

36
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:30,189
isn't going to help us get to the answer of the dying message.

37
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:37,204
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Empty Fort Strategy)"

38
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:41,104
I see.

39
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,904
That's why the chairs of the first murder site

40
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:46,904
were painted black and white.

41
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:48,207
Yep!

42
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,204
It seemed that the victim, Mr. Akashi

43
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,004
liked chess too!

44
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:56,215
If so, why did the culprit

45
00:03:56,215 --> 00:04:00,219
paint the wall of the second murder red?

46
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,504
Because he was convinced that even if it were left that way,

47
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:05,904
no one would be able to figure it out.

48
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:06,904
I get it!

49
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:08,504
The dying message...

50
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:10,704
Was not the red wall to begin with!

51
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:14,504
Someone other than the culprit who would've had to do so is...

52
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,237
Nobody else but Shiro Naoki!

53
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:19,604
Finally...

54
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,104
You've finally reached that conclusion.

55
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:27,104
Ko... Koume?

56
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,304
You've regained consciousness!

57
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:32,604
Are you okay, moving around like that?

58
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,253
Yes. I guess so.

59
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:38,257
If so, let's go nab the culprit on the double!

60
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,504
Mochi that is drawn on the ground

61
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,263
cannot be consumed.

62
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,404
It's a pity that the deductions that we have reached

63
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,504
are no more than mochi drawn on the ground.

64
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:52,004
It's not edible at all.

65
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,804
In other words, you're saying that we have no proof.

66
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:58,804
But Mr. Shiro Naoki said

67
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:02,281
that he would soon be going to a place called Lecce in Italy,

68
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,704
so if you want to find him, come look for him there, right?

69
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,291
Oh, that's very meaningful.

70
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,604
If so, I've got a great idea.

71
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,295
That goes for me too.

72
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,604
Hey!

73
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:19,904
Leave this to me, of the Prefecture Police Department Headquarters!

74
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,304
Oh, no way.

75
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:24,704
How about doing this, then?

76
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,904
Describe your strategy in one word

77
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:29,104
and display it on the screen of your cell phones

78
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,804
and show it to each other?

79
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:34,804
Just like Koume and Zhou did before the Battle of Red Cliffs!

80
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,104
All right.

81
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,304
Geez, what a hassle.

82
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:45,704
Here goes.

83
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:47,604
Ready, get set.

84
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:54,333
Just as I thought after all.

85
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,804
The Empty Fort Strategy!

86
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,804
"Empty"

87
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,804
I wish you'd cut it out, inspector.

88
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:05,904
Being called out like this so many times.

89
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,347
You're going to run us out of business.

90
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:12,351
It's true that we used to live in this house before.

91
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,353
But, I think it's just a coincidence

92
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:18,357
that all of our alibis for last night are ambiguous.

93
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,504
Didn't I tell you that

94
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,704
we were near the house that burned down

95
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:24,904
because we were summoned over by text mail?

96
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:28,704
In the first place, did you solve the mystery of the red wall?

97
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:31,704
We haven't solved that mystery yet.

98
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:35,704
But, it seems that Mr. Shiro Naoki who became the second victim,

99
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,377
have caught on to something.

100
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,104
Do you have any idea what it could be?

101
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:41,704
I wonder.

102
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:44,383
I only know that he was in need of money.

103
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,904
He was saying he was going on a trip soon.

104
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:52,391
That's right, to a place in Italy called Lecce.

105
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,404
Then maybe he was going to walk over there

106
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:57,304
to the place called Lecce

107
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,399
to hide something important!

108
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,204
Besides, it seems that he also said

109
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:06,404
to come to look for him there after he's gone.

110
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:08,407
Why would he walk over?

111
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:12,004
Because Italy is shaped like a shoe, isn't it?

112
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:14,104
At any rate!

113
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:17,204
If you want to investigate us any further...

114
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,419
Do that after you find necessary proof.

115
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:23,204
We don't have all the time in the world too, you see.

116
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:24,804
See you.

117
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:26,104
If you will excuse me then.

118
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:32,431
We've done what needs to be done,

119
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,804
so now we sit and wait, right?

120
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,204
Those who travel a 100 miles

121
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:39,504
regard 90 miles as only half.

122
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:41,604
We should keep on our guard.

123
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,204
Yeah.

124
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:46,204
We can't afford not solving this case, after we've come this far.

125
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,704
PC60, PC60.

126
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,704
A taxi robbery occurred in the industry area...

127
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:00,459
Darn. Just as I thought,

128
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,604
there are officers staked out even in back of Shiro's apartment.

129
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:06,104
So, it was a trap after all.

130
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,467
What? A taxi robbery?

131
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,604
Near here?

132
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:12,104
Yeah, they want us there on the double.

133
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:20,104
What happened? Are they going to leave?

134
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:23,004
Which means that, this apartment is going to be empty.

135
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,489
No, wait.

136
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:33,704
The drunkard that fell forward in front of the apartment just now

137
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:34,493
and the man wearing the mask

138
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:37,004
that've been loitering around from a while ago.

139
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:40,499
One of them could be an officer.

140
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:45,704
Sir, you'll catch cold sleeping in a place like this!

141
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:48,507
Shut up! Stay out of this!

142
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:51,704
Idiot! Who gives a hoot about the chairman...

143
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:55,004
I guess the drunkard's not an officer.

144
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:57,504
Hey, you. Are you all right?

145
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,704
You're so drunk.

146
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:04,523
I can go another two or three shops!

147
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,104
Hey!

148
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:08,527
Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:13,804
I broke my leg!

150
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,535
Are you all right?

151
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:18,537
Hey, jerk!

152
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:21,104
Give me a million yen to pay for what you did!

153
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,004
1 million yen?

154
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,204
I don't have that much money!

155
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:27,704
Then, give me your wallet and all!

156
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,904
No!

157
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,549
He's mugging the man?

158
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,204
If the man wearing the mask is an officer,

159
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:36,004
he would never overlook this.

160
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,704
Now I can go drink some more.

161
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,804
Are you sure?

162
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:51,704
Darn it.

163
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,573
What should I tell my mother?

164
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,579
What?

165
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,804
Don't tell me that the man is an underwear thief?

166
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:12,604
Hey! He's going into Shiro's room now.

167
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,604
Absurd! If he does that...

168
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:23,804
The officers staking out outside of the apartment will get him.

169
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:27,904
They're gone.

170
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:30,304
Right, the police cars that were staking out here

171
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,304
went to the taxi robbery site too.

172
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:39,804
The man who went in a while ago's

173
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,804
coming out from Shiro's room.

174
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:45,704
A mugger, underwear thief and a break in.

175
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:49,004
No doubt about it! The police aren't staking out.

176
00:10:57,204 --> 00:11:00,304
I'll go get the stuff now while they're gone, then.

177
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,204
Which one? Which one?

178
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,204
Which shoe did he hide it in?

179
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:07,904
Could it be that...

180
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:13,004
you're looking for this shoe?

181
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,655
This shoe is a bit different, isn't it?

182
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
The heel comes off

183
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:23,604
and the memory card of a cell phone is inside!

184
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,004
Yes.

185
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,004
Right where Lecce of Italy is located on the map,

186
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:29,404
by the heel of the shoe!

187
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:33,404
Too bad you couldn't find it before I did.

188
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,404
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa?

189
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,285
Who the heck are you?

190
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:50,685
Oh, come on.

191
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:54,085
We've met so many times, have you forgotten?

192
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:57,085
Conan Edogawa.

193
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,485
A detective.

194
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,699
It's you?

195
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,285
But, I'm sure...

196
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,985
You...

197
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,485
Haven't forgotten...

198
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:07,985
Us!

199
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,485
Then the mugging

200
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,385
and thief breaking in that I saw a while ago were...

201
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:12,711
Yeah.

202
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:16,285
It's the Empty Fort Strategy!

203
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,285
The Empty Fort Strategy?

204
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,785
With only the police cars withdrawing,

205
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:25,385
you may suspect that the officers are still hiding,

206
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,785
but if in the midst of this psychological circumstance,

207
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,385
the people who were around the apartment

208
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:32,731
act unlike police officers

209
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,185
and further crimes are committed,

210
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:39,685
your suspicion will soon subside.

211
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:42,085
The Empty Fort Strategy

212
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:44,743
is when someone deliberately loosens one's guard

213
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:46,745
under the pretense of luring the enemy over,

214
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
when actually he keeps the enemy away.

215
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,885
But ours has the opposite effect.

216
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:57,785
So, you talked about the shoe at the station

217
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:01,785
to lure me out here after all.

218
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:07,385
No, we knew from the start that you would show up here.

219
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,285
It bothered me to begin with.

220
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,985
I couldn't understand why the culprit also left behind

221
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:16,085
the dying message of the victim of the first murder site,

222
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:18,777
at the second murder site.

223
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,185
But, if that red wall was not

224
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:24,783
a dying message left behind by the victim...

225
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,585
Right. If it were painted not by the victim nor the culprit,

226
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:29,385
but rather, a third person...

227
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:32,785
It's understandable that the culprit would deliberately

228
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:35,885
leave behind the red wall at the second murder site

229
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:39,185
in order to confuse investigation of the police.

230
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,185
Are you saying that the third person

231
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:43,085
is Mr. Shiro Naoki?

232
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:44,803
Yeah.

233
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:45,885
If someone other than the culprit

234
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:49,585
were to have painted over Mr. Akashi's red paint,

235
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:53,585
the only thinkable thing is that he would've written in katakana.

236
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:57,985
"I was killed by Naoki".

237
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,485
In other words, that you,

238
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,821
Naoki Midorikawa is the culprit!

239
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:05,985
I see. So, Mr. Shiro Naoki who came to beg for money,

240
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:09,185
happened to coincidentally find the message,

241
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,829
thought it was referring to him

242
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:14,585
and painted the wall entirely red.

243
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:17,385
If it were written in katakana rather than Chinese characters,

244
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:19,185
he wouldn't have made that mistake.

245
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:22,841
That's probably because he wrote using spray paint.

246
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,685
The fine details of the characters would disappear with spray.

247
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:30,485
And, while he was spraying red paint on the wall,

248
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,851
he realized that

249
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,853
the "Naoki" that was written there

250
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,285
was not his last name, Naoki, but, rather,

251
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:39,985
the name of the only person that Mr. Akashi used to call by name,

252
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:44,885
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, he was referring to you.

253
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,867
And, he took a picture of the half-erased characters with cell phone,

254
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,685
and decided to blackmail you.

255
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:52,871
Isn't that right?

256
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,873
Yeah, right.

257
00:14:54,873 --> 00:15:00,885
That's why I strangled Shiro in this room where he called me over to.

258
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:02,485
Darn!

259
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,285
If only Shiro didn't come into the room

260
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,185
where I starved Shusaku to death.

261
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:09,385
If only I had painted the entire wall red.

262
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:11,185
Don't tell me

263
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:14,885
you still don't understand the meaning of the red wall, sir?

264
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:18,485
The dying message would only be complete

265
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,285
after the culprit himself paints the entire wall red.

266
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,385
What do you mean?

267
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,985
Do you know what an after image of a complementary color is?

268
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,985
After image of a complementary color?

269
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,985
It's a phenomenon of which after staring at a certain color for some time,

270
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,885
then looking at a different place after that,

271
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:36,585
the complementary color that was being looked at a while ago remains!

272
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:39,585
You see, the surgical gown that surgeons wear

273
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,585
is light green colored, right?

274
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:44,923
That's because when they have to look at red blood during surgery,

275
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,185
the after image of the complementary color green

276
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,685
gets in the way of concentration.

277
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:49,885
Therefore, wearing a gown of the same green color

278
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,585
softens the effect.

279
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,933
In other words, that red wall was also a dying message

280
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:57,685
using the after image supplementary color effect!

281
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,485
In that room,

282
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:02,085
the white chair faced the red wall

283
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,985
and the black chair was facing the white wall,

284
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,585
and both were nailed to the floor.

285
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:09,485
This was done to set the rail to solve the message!

286
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:12,951
Mr. Shusaku used to like playing chess.

287
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,585
In chess, the white piece gets to go first

288
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:16,485
and the black follow.

289
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:17,585
In other words,

290
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:21,685
after sitting in the white chair staring at the red wall,

291
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:24,685
if you sit in the black chair and stare at the white wall,

292
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:27,785
the after image of green, the complementary color of red,

293
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:32,971
will show up vividly on the white wall.

294
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,685
Midori (green), which means you,

295
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:37,385
Mr. Midorikawa.

296
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,685
That's why Mr. Akashi

297
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,185
threw out all the other paints he had from the window,

298
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:44,685
except for the red paint.

299
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:47,885
So that the wall wouldn't be painted using any other color.

300
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,885
In other words, he assumed that

301
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:54,285
you would be the first to discover his dead body

302
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:57,485
and erase whatever he wrote and left behind.

303
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:59,485
He outwitted you by scheming it

304
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,985
so that you would disclose yourself as the culprit

305
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,685
by painting the entire wall.

306
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,085
That was the dying message he left behind.

307
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,185
It's indeed as the saying goes,

308
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:11,885
"Koume's men follow his orders even after his death!"

309
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,285
Exactly.

310
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:20,485
By me painting the entire wall, eh?

311
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:24,585
What a guy.

312
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,025
He goes and paints over an important portrait

313
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:31,585
and ruthlessly kills a precious person, and yet...

314
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,085
You mean, that portrait...

315
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,785
Yeah.

316
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,035
The portrait that Aoi kept looking for

317
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,385
until she collapsed from a heart attack

318
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:44,385
that Shusaku drew of her long ago.

319
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:47,045
That portrait was found!

320
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,385
It was underneath another totally different portrait

321
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,485
that I bought a year ago!

322
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,685
Underneath?

323
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:57,885
I bought it because it looked a bit like Aoi.

324
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,985
But, I decided to check for myself anyway.

325
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:02,485
I had it checked by X-Ray,

326
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,063
and found Aoi's portrait as it emerged

327
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,985
from underneath that drawing!

328
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,585
That guy Shusaku

329
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:12,385
painted Aoi's portrait all white

330
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:15,085
and drew another drawing in place of it!

331
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:17,385
Oh no.

332
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:18,785
It's true that Shusaku's drawings

333
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:21,885
started to gain attention these past two to three years.

334
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:25,083
I understand that he couldn't help but do something like that back then,

335
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,087
because when he drew that picture,

336
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,485
he didn't even have the money to buy a canvas.

337
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,685
Why didn't he tell Aoi about it?

338
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:39,097
If he had only said something about it to Aoi,

339
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,101
she wouldn't have had to die.

340
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,285
Why did he keep quiet

341
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:46,885
and locked himself in room to continue painting?

342
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,107
I locked him in the room to give him a taste of his own medicine,

343
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:53,111
to understand how terrible Aoi may have felt.

344
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:57,115
The day after Aoi passed away.

345
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,785
When I visited that house,

346
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,685
a portrait was being burned in the yard.

347
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:10,885
It was Aoi's portrait with paint

348
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:13,585
that wasn't completely dried yet.

349
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,685
Do you mean that

350
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:17,985
the picture that Mr. Akashi was drawing locked up in his room was...

351
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,685
I'm sure it was that picture.

352
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,685
He probably locked himself in his room

353
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,143
and kept drawing her portrait in order to finish it in time

354
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,485
and surprise her with the drawing on her birthday,

355
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,685
that was the following day.

356
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:34,385
No!

357
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,085
Just what have I done?

358
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,885
Aoi.

359
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:43,485
Shusaku.

360
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,167
No one should interfere with the intimate relationship of others.

361
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,485
In other words, no third-party interference is needed

362
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:56,285
when two people have an intimate relationship with each other.

363
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:23,585
Okay, Koume,

364
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:25,785
I'll leave the rest for you to finish then!

365
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:30,785
Well, you're the one who first solved the mystery of the red wall.

366
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,185
It bugs me a bit,

367
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:35,273
but I'll leave submitting the report of the case to you!

368
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:37,985
It's just as I thought, after all.

369
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:42,385
It seems that you said you stuck that boy to me

370
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,283
so that he could watch over me.

371
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:50,185
But, doing something like that would be risking too much

372
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,085
being that I was on the list of suspects too.

373
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:57,295
You had no doubt that I was innocent to begin with,

374
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:02,085
but made that boy accompany me anyway, didn't you?

375
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:04,985
You chose him as a partner to pierce through the truth of the case.

376
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:07,985
Hey, he's still a kid, you know.

377
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:11,309
When we the police were getting frustrated

378
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,985
at the scene of the second murder,

379
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:16,685
deducing that it was the culprit challenging the police,

380
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,085
that boy kept his cool and remarked.

381
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:23,685
But, I wonder if the culprit wasn't scared?

382
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:26,385
To copy the dying message without even knowing

383
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:30,485
about the murder site in detail!

384
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:32,585
If he didn't mention what he did,

385
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,685
I wonder if we would've ever arrived at the truth of the red wall.

386
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,337
Much less, the place where the evidence was hidden.

387
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:42,085
We arrived at the answer because the boy

388
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,885
mentioned information about Lecce.

389
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:48,285
You planned it so that I would solve the case this way,

390
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,785
give me credit for it

391
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,385
and get me to return to the Nagano Prefectural Police Station...

392
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:57,085
but that's all uncalled for.

393
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,085
If our positions were reversed,

394
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:03,361
you would've done the same, wouldn't you?

395
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:08,185
I would've worked it out more cleverly.

396
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:11,369
So, you wouldn't have realized a tinge of what I was doing.

397
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,785
Oh, I see, I get it!

398
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,373
This case is mine!

399
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:17,985
You can stay at the local police for life, then!

400
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,985
But, Kansuke.

401
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:30,485
I really appreciate you letting me meet the boy.

402
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:33,185
Thanks to him, it's come back to me.

403
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:39,785
A phrase that I love, from a book that I love with all my heart,

404
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:45,403
"The boy, as if he had seen through the entire truth,"

405
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,405
"remarked quietly with cool eyes"

406
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:48,785
"and seriously,"

407
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:52,885
"started disclosing the truth."

408
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:54,085
"Right."

409
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,785
"Just like that famed strategist,"

410
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:58,185
"Koume Shokatsuryo."

411
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,580
The rainbow colored trademark is what makes it popular!
