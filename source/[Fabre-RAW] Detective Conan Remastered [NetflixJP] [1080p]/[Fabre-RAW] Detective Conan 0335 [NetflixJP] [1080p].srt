1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,740
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,840
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,440
We'll get to see the Yaiba movie that we had been looking forward to.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
A surprising incident occurs just before watching it.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,160
"Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 1)"

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,560
2958cc, 220 horse power,

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
V-6 cylinder, 24 bulb,

11
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,660
equipped with DOHC engine...

12
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,960
Hey. Couldn't you find any other rental car, or what?

13
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,960
What's wrong with this? This car is just the car for me!

14
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,860
I think you're speeding too much.

15
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,260
Don't worry.

16
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,660
They don't have any "speed traps" here,

17
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,760
and I'm being very careful, too.

18
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,560
Hey, idiot!

19
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,360
What you gotta be careful of is not the police, but the speedometer!

20
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,560
Could I ask you something?

21
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,260
What is it?

22
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,860
Where are we headed?

23
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,260
It's about time you tell us.

24
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,160
Please!

25
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,160
To a place that you'd all love to go.

26
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,560
How mean!

27
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Mrs. Edogawa.

28
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,760
I told you that she's not my mother,

29
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,060
but a middle aged relative of mine.

30
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,560
She's my aunt.

31
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,860
Hello?

32
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,560
What's wrong with calling her middle aged, when that's what she is?

33
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,660
Yes.

34
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,260
Mr. Karata.

35
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,760
What?

36
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,360
You're having trouble with the timing

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,660
and the time for "Zero" may be delayed?

38
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,260
Okay, okay.

39
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,560
We're on our way there, so I'll see you.

40
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,260
What is this "Zero" about?

41
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,060
The number of a robot or something?

42
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,060
Come on, please tell us.

43
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,360
It's a secret.

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,860
-What? Stingy! -What's the big deal!

45
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,560
We're probably just going to see the prerelease

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
of "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II" or something like that, right?

47
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,560
What?

48
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,560
-Is that true? -That's amazing!

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,660
I want to see it! I really want to see it!

50
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
Here goes, Joker!

51
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Kamen Yaiba!

52
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,360
How did you figure out

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,260
that we were going to the see the prerelease of Kamen Yaiba?

54
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,960
Because timing means adjusting the color of the images

55
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,160
and "zero" means a film that has just been made.

56
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,860
Both words are a jargon of the movie and drama industry.

57
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,760
And, if it were to be a movie that everyone would enjoy,

58
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,960
then it must be "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II".

59
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,060
Since we get to see "zero",

60
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,660
it probably means the release date is coming soon,

61
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,960
so they're going to use "zero" for the prerelease, right?

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
Right!

63
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,660
Just as expected of you!

64
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,460
Hey, the signal's changed to green some time ago.

65
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,460
What? No joke!

66
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,160
Oh, no! It's changed to yellow!

67
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm sorry. How absentminded of me.

68
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Hey! Would you give it a rest?

69
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
You got children in the car, you know!

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,860
Okay, okay.

71
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
Wow!

72
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,260
It's like we're riding a jet coaster.

73
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,360
Ouch!

74
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,860
Hey!

75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Conan, your mother is sure a lot of fun.

76
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,660
I keep telling you that she wasn't.

77
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,360
So, this is the Tohto Processing Station.

78
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,760
It has a very long history.

79
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,560
It has walked the path along with the movies of Japan.

80
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Come on, let's go.

81
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,760
Behave yourselves, okay?

82
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay...

83
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,460
Hey there, Yukiko. Long time no see!

84
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,560
You're as beautiful as ever.

85
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,460
Yes, of course.

86
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,860
You haven't changed a bit yourself, Mr. Karata.

87
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,560
That's right.

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,660
He's Mr. Karata, the one who's going show us

89
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
the newly made Kamen Yaiba movie.

90
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,960
Nice to meet you...

91
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,260
He's the timing man,

92
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,260
and he finishes all my movies with nice colors.

93
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,260
"Takayoshi Karata (46), Timing Man" -Right?

94
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,560
Huh? Which means...

95
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,360
Did you used to be an actress?

96
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,260
Yes.

97
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,660
Maybe I was adored by your mother and father.

98
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
-No joke! -Really?

99
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,060
I see.

100
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,260
Your power of deduction was handed down from your father.

101
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Liking to stand out, your confidence the acting talent

102
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,560
that you display when using the voice changer...

103
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,760
Moreover, your dangerous character of acting on impulse when angered.

104
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,160
You inherited from your mother.

105
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,860
Well, sorry.

106
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,660
And? When will you be able to show the "zero" preview?

107
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,660
Well, I think it's going to take a while yet.

108
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,360
I think we can manage to get it done around 7 pm though.

109
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,060
I'm sorry, but could you wait around till then?

110
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,860
You can take a tour around this place if you like.

111
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,160
Okay.

112
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Mr. Hojima and Mr. Negami.

113
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,060
Would you do me a favor and show Yukiko and the children

114
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,160
inside the processing station?

115
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,460
"Yoshihiko Negami (42)" -Sure.

116
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,560
"Akira Hojima (28)" -Okay.

117
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
This is the preview room

118
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,660
where you'll all be watching the Kamen Yaiba movie later.

119
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
It's like a theater!

120
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,560
I want to see it quick.

121
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,860
This is the dark room.

122
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,660
This is the room where you check for scratches and spots

123
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,460
before putting the film through the developing machine.

124
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,060
And this is the developing machine for the 35 mm films.

125
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,260
Well? Isn't it interesting with all the machines around?

126
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,760
-Yes! -It's like a laboratory!

127
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,860
What's this sound?

128
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,660
It's a warning telling us not to open the double door

129
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,460
because someone's going into the dark room.

130
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,760
While the film is being checked,

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,860
even a slight amount of light with over expose the film and damage it.

132
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,160
After the film is checked,

133
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,060
Mr. Negami here is the develop man who makes the negatives

134
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,560
by putting the films through the developing machine.

135
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,260
Then, I make his negatives into positive prints.

136
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,960
I see.

137
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,660
Then, after the films are edited and dubbed with sounds,

138
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,160
the timing man, Mr. Karata that you met a while ago

139
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
adjusts the color and does the finishing touches.

140
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,460
How come only you don't have "man" at the end of the job you do?

141
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,560
Come to think of it, we don't say "print man".

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
Right.

143
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Could it be that you're weak?

144
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
Weak...

145
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,860
I'm not a transforming hero or anything like that, you know.

146
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,260
-I'm pretty sure that's it. -Oh...

147
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,360
-Come on, Genta! -It's almost 6:40 pm.

148
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,060
Shall we go into the preview room then?

149
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,660
I guess so.

150
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,060
It's going to take a while to see that preview.

151
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,660
But Mr. Karata told us a while ago that it would be ready about 7:00.

152
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,360
"Norihiro Furumura (39), Salesman" -According to Karata,

153
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,460
he says it'll take till about 11 pm.

154
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,660
It's going to run that late.

155
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,060
Well, I guess it doesn't concern me because I goofed

156
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,360
and I'm out of work.

157
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,260
You sure look sleepy.

158
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,860
Did you play mahjong again?

159
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,360
Sort of.

160
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,660
But this is bad.

161
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,860
What seems to be the matter?

162
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,860
I won't be able to make my flight back if it's going to be 11 pm.

163
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,360
I can't make the children stay here till that late, besides.

164
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,560
Then, shall I watch the children in my room?

165
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Huh?

166
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,860
My condo is right close by.

167
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,160
They can sleep there until it's time for the preview,

168
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,760
then I'll take them home by car after they finish watching.

169
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,460
Okay. Could I ask you to do so?

170
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,160
Are you going to make the children sleep in that sloppy room?

171
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,660
How rude.

172
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,760
It may be sloppy, but it's not filthy.

173
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,860
Well, it's only if the children want to, though.

174
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,560
Let's stay over and watch it, okay, Conan?

175
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Bedsides, tomorrow is Sunday.

176
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,060
We can boast about it to the other kids in school, too.

177
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
Okay, Conan?

178
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Okay, then call your folks and tell them that you're going to be late.

179
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Okay...

180
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,960
-We did it! -All right!

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,760
Okay then, let's get work over with

182
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
and take a snooze too then.

183
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,960
Right. We'd better get ourselves ready

184
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
for the usual film completion celebration all night mahjong game man.

185
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
What's an all-night mahjong game man?

186
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Does it have something to do with the developing man?

187
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
It means we're going to play mahjong all night.

188
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Shin.

189
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,760
What?

190
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
What's with you? You sure are popular with girls, aren't you?

191
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,860
What?

192
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,160
Oh, Ayumi.

193
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,760
And the other girl, too.

194
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,960
Ms. Haibara.

195
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,660
What?

196
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,860
She stared at you at least 10 times today.

197
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,260
I guess she was watching the growth process of the guinea pig

198
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,860
who drank the drug she made.

199
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,360
How silly! Girls look at boys

200
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,760
either because there's something on his face

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,060
or because she's in love with the boy.

202
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,460
Ai?

203
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,160
No way.

204
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,060
I hope you got rid of that car

205
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,760
that was tailing us on our way here.

206
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,060
So you noticed them too, Shin?

207
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,960
Of course.

208
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,360
You were stopped all the while the traffic signal

209
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,260
changed from green to yellow,

210
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,560
but the car behind us didn't even toot a horn.

211
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,760
In other words, they didn't want us to notice them.

212
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,460
That is, they were tailing us.

213
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,960
They were tailing us for quite some time.

214
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Right, I thought so too.

215
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,060
So I was planning to take off as soon as the light turned red.

216
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,660
I wonder who they are?

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,560
That's true.

218
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:10,960
If that car was after me or Ai...

219
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,560
it's highly likely that it's those guys.

220
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,560
Those guys that shrunk my body.

221
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,860
The probability is high that they are the men in black.

222
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,990
That's true.

223
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:39,190
If that car was after me or Ai...

224
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,990
it's highly likely that it's those guys.

225
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,590
Those guys that shrunk my body.

226
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,890
The probability is high that they are the men in black.

227
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,490
No. There is another possibility.

228
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,090
The person who is riding that car is...

229
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,490
A great fan of mine!

230
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,290
What?

231
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,190
That person probably wanted to know where I live and get my autograph!

232
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,190
Oh, my poor thing!

233
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,390
I sure hope so.

234
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,690
You'd better protect them nice and good

235
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,490
because you're all they've got.

236
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,490
Yeah.

237
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,290
I know.

238
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,090
See you then, everybody!

239
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,590
Enjoy watching the preview and go home safely.

240
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,790
Okay! Thank you...

241
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,890
Oh, that's right!

242
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,190
Come here.

243
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,890
What is it?

244
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,390
The girl that was staring at you...

245
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,790
Make sure you escort her all the way, and see that she gets home safely.

246
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,690
I know.

247
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,890
So annoying.

248
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,690
You're going to be late for your flight.

249
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,090
Oh, right. See you then, Shin!

250
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,590
I'll see you all some time again!

251
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,290
This is...

252
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,190
It's way messier than I imagined it to be.

253
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,590
Don't you know how to clean up?

254
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,190
Okay then, let's clean up before we take a nap.

255
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,590
Wait!

256
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,090
No, no, don't touch!

257
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,690
Huh? Why not?

258
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,590
I'm going to loose track of where everything is.

259
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,090
Is that so?

260
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,490
Is that really true?

261
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,090
It's tiring.

262
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,090
Okay, we'll sleep on the sofa,

263
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,290
so you kids sleep in this room.

264
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,390
If you sleep sideways on this bed,

265
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,990
I guess you can all sleep here.

266
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,090
This room is messy, too.

267
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,890
You can say that again.

268
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,490
I've been busy recently, so...

269
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,090
Good work all day today!

270
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,390
I'm going to give my best shot...

271
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,690
-playing all night mahjong tonight. -What is he doing?

272
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,790
I'll report the result later.

273
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,690
Recently, he's been hooked on making video diaries.

274
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,790
I'm going back to the station because I've still got work left to do.

275
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,890
What shall I do?

276
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,090
What shall I do? I'm so excited, I can't sleep!

277
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,190
Hey, Mitsuhiko. Are you asleep?

278
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,290
No, not yet.

279
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,290
The subtitle was "Counterattack of the Lord of Potatoes", right?

280
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:13,390
No. The subtitle that was shown in the preview was...

281
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,590
The subtitle was...

282
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,890
It was... subtitle...

283
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,790
Gosh! "The Requiem of the Potato Queen"!

284
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,690
Don't forget!

285
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,290
They're fast asleep.

286
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,490
It can't be helped.

287
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,290
They're children, unlike us.

288
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,490
Hey, Ai.

289
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,290
Can I...

290
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,890
Can I ask you something?

291
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,290
Is there anything on my face?

292
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,090
What?

293
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,390
What was that?

294
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,390
Hey, Mr. Furumura!

295
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,090
What's the matter? Mr. Furumura!

296
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,190
Mr. Furumura...

297
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,990
Conan. What was it?

298
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,390
Is it time?

299
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,290
Mr. Furumura!

300
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,390
How was it done in the dark?

301
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,000
Next Conan's Hint:

302
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,160
"Fluorescent paint"

303
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,660
There are many odd people working as movie staff, don't you think?

304
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,400
Like, Mr. Suwa, Mr. Yoshioka and Haibara.

305
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,480
Who are they?
