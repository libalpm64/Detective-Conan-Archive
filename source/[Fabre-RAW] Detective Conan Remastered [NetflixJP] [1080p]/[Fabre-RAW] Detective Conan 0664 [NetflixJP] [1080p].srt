"Hiroshi Yagisawa (34)"

2
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:31,398
Good evening, Anera.

3
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:45,098
Hey, not that way.

4
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:52,898
What's the matter, Cool?

5
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:25,198
If all cases were men,

6
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:26,998
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

7
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,598
There are four marks on the map that was found.

8
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:30,498
The Youth Detective Squad wonders if it's a treasure or a case.

9
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:32,098
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:34,073
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,075
His name is Detective Conan!

12
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:06,524
"Good Work Cool 2"

13
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:10,169
"The following day, Saturday"

14
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,624
Genta, you're licking candy again?

15
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,224
Today it's grape flavour.

16
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,177
You're licking candy drops a lot

17
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,924
even when we're going to school, right?

18
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,924
If I lick it just before leaving home,

19
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,924
I finish licking it just around when I get to school.

20
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,324
You're going to get cavities.

21
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:30,189
I mean, he probably has them already, no?

22
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,197
Sakaeya Cleaning?

23
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,724
What, what?

24
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:43,324
It's a map, isn't it?

25
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,124
Is it a treasure map?

26
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,824
I don't think so,

27
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:50,924
because the four X marks all seem to be houses.

28
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:53,624
Maybe they are houses that burglars are targeting?

29
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:54,924
Burglars?

30
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:57,124
See. There have been a several such burglaries

31
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:58,624
in the Yonehara community area.

32
00:03:58,624 --> 00:03:59,924
Idiot.

33
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:01,624
Why would such a map be drawn in back of a flyer...

34
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,024
I'm sure.

35
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,223
We've got to report it right away.

36
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,225
Are you guys listening?

37
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,824
Okay, let's go!

38
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:09,224
-All right! -Hey!

39
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,924
Aren't you going to the library...

40
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,524
His imagination way far out does yours.

41
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:16,824
Geez.

42
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,124
Then, you haven't been burglarized or anything?

43
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,724
"Ooga" -I'm glad.

44
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:25,924
We made it in time didn't we, Mitsuhiko.

45
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:26,924
Yes.

46
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:29,424
"Norifumi Ooga (36)" -But, I wonder if it's really something

47
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:31,124
that a burglar drew.

48
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:34,253
It's very likely.

49
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,255
Have you seen any suspicious person

50
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,824
or encounter any strange occurrences recently?

51
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:40,259
Nothing in particular, but...

52
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:43,824
Do you know, the three houses?

53
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,124
No.

54
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:48,724
"Misako (34)" -It sure is creepy.

55
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:51,624
Why is our house marked with an X?

56
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,624
Hey, don't go on the grass!

57
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:58,024
You too.

58
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:01,324
I told you not to smoke in front of Tomoya.

59
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,424
"Tomoya (6)" -Sorry.

60
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,624
What do you do for a living?

61
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,124
I'm a constructor.

62
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:12,291
At any rate, don't bring strange things over.

63
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,295
How about it?

64
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,324
Do you know anything about the three houses?

65
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,324
"Eguchi" -Nothing in particular.

66
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:24,303
"Tamae Eguchi (32)" -We haven't been burglarized,

67
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,324
nor I have I seen anybody suspicious.

68
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,624
There's been no strange occurrences either.

69
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:39,924
Are you living here alone, ma'am?

70
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,321
Yes.

71
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,824
What do you do for a living?

72
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,024
An illustrator.

73
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,924
So, I guess that's enough already.

74
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:51,324
I'm busy, you know.

75
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,224
How is it?

76
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,324
Does anything come to mind?

77
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,124
"Shizuko Fujiki (61)" -No.

78
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:03,724
Who on earth made something like this?

79
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:22,724
What's wrong, mother?

80
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,124
Koichi.

81
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:28,724
These children say that they found this map.

82
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,369
Map?

83
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,124
See? There's an X mark on our house.

84
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:37,424
We thought that it could be a map that a burglar drew.

85
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:39,824
Have you seen any suspicious people lately?

86
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,381
Were there any strange occurrences and stuff like that?

87
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,383
"Koichi Fujiki (33)"

88
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,724
I don't think there was any in particular.

89
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:50,389
Do you know any of those three houses?

90
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,724
No.

91
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:54,024
What do you do for a living?

92
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,624
I'm a businessman.

93
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,924
I'm getting kind of worried.

94
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:02,424
No, I don't think it has anything to do with a burglar.

95
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,424
But, if it bothers you,

96
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,024
I'll keep this map and take it to the police.

97
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:09,124
No, if we find out that is what it is,

98
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,924
we'll take it to the police.

99
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,411
-Okay then. -Yes.

100
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:19,024
Police cars are here?

101
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,624
"Eitaro Kouzuki" -Kouzuki. It's over here.

102
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,423
Maybe the burglar already broke in here?

103
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,924
Darn, we were too late.

104
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:30,824
Hello. Did anything happen at the Kouzuki residence?

105
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:33,424
Mr. Kouzuki passed away.

106
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,224
He was found at the bottom of the stairs bleeding from his head

107
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:41,824
in the underground pass a little ways from here on Beika Boulevard,

108
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:44,924
last night around 10:00 pm.

109
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,924
At the bottom of the stairs?

110
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,624
Did he fall to his death...

111
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:51,424
or is it a murder case?

112
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:05,624
So, if anything comes up...

113
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,624
"Sawako Kouzuki (35)"

114
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:10,024
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,624
Who is she?

116
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,924
She's his only daughter, Sawako.

117
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:17,824
Maybe this map has nothing to do with a burglary,

118
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:21,024
but rather has something to do with Mr. Kouzuki's case.

119
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,824
What do you mean?

120
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,724
This map was drawn by that culprit.

121
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:29,224
And, he is still after somebody in the remaining three houses.

122
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:32,824
What? What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

123
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,497
Officer, this map...

124
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:39,924
I'm busy now.

125
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:42,124
Go ask for directions at the police box.

126
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,224
What the heck?

127
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:49,824
I won't give them any information anymore!

128
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:51,324
What do you think?

129
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,024
The map, do we have a case?

130
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:56,224
No connection. I'd like to say but...

131
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:59,624
At any rate, let's go take a look at the site.

132
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:02,824
Hey, you guys, wait for me at the library park.

133
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:05,924
Where are you going?

134
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,124
What is it?

135
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:19,324
Did the dead person's hand really smell of cigarette?

136
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,124
Yes, sir. No mistake about it.

137
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:22,824
When I got there,

138
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:25,324
I smelled it slightly from his bloody right hand.

139
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:29,424
But, his daughter told me that he doesn't smoke.

140
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:33,524
Moreover, there were no cigarette butts near the scene of the crime.

141
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,624
Strange.

142
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,024
Cigarette.

143
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,124
Conan sure is late.

144
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:41,624
While we're doing this,

145
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,324
the evil hands of the culprit may be...

146
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,624
Say, why don't we do our thing on our own...

147
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,924
Wait until Conan comes back.

148
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,124
Okay.

149
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,224
It sure is hot, don't you think?

150
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,573
I want ice cream, don't you?

151
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,124
There's a vending machine in the library.

152
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:59,124
Let's go get some.

153
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:00,924
How about you, Ai?

154
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,324
No, thanks.

155
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:05,524
-Ice cream... -What should I get?

156
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,062
What on earth are they doing?

157
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:45,962
Mr. Yagisawa, hello.

158
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,962
Hi, Conan, long time no see.

159
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,062
Cool! How're you doing?

160
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,762
Do you know them?

161
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:58,162
Yes. I got to solve a murder case

162
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:01,062
thanks to Cool some time ago.

163
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,362
By the way, you guys...

164
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,362
We lost the map.

165
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:10,162
Maybe the culprit of Mr. Kouzuki's incident took it away?

166
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:12,651
You mean Mr. Kouzuki who passed away last night?

167
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,653
Do you know him, Mr. Yagisawa?

168
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:19,062
Rather... Cool's the one who found his body.

169
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:20,659
What?

170
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,862
And, that map that you guys are looking for,

171
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,162
is it the one with the X mark on Mr. Kouzuki's house

172
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:29,162
as well as three other houses?

173
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:31,562
How did you know?

174
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:34,962
Because I drew that map.

175
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:43,262
I drew that for my wife who takes Cool for a walk for me at times,

176
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:44,462
to let her know which houses to be careful of,

177
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:46,462
by marking them with X marks.

178
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:50,262
My wife dropped that map while she was walking the dog.

179
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:53,862
Mrs. Ooga who lives in the first house, has a bad temper.

180
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:56,362
Back when Cool went a bit into the lawn,

181
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,062
she bawled him out.

182
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,062
I thought it better not to let Cool near the 2nd house

183
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,162
which is the Eguchi residence,

184
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,262
because she sprays insecticide on the roses.

185
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:07,862
Mrs. Eguchi uses organic fertilizer

186
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,562
and since dogs like the smell,

187
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,062
they tend to go near it, right?

188
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:14,713
Yes, and the 3rd house, the Fujiki residence.

189
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,162
The mother of the house is fussy about cleanliness

190
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:17,462
to the point of being phobic

191
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:20,362
and hates dog's urine to the extreme.

192
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:21,962
Right.

193
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:24,462
How did you know, Conan?

194
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:27,862
That lady, not only flooded the area around her house

195
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,162
but did the same to the house opposite hers

196
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:32,462
as well as at the foot of the telephone pole.

197
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:34,162
I see.

198
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:37,862
And, so Mr. Kouzuki also hated dog urine, right?

199
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,362
Yes.

200
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:42,262
He used to clean the outside of his house all the time.

201
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,662
When Cool almost urinated during his walk,

202
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:47,762
the man shooed him away with a wooden broom.

203
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,062
Come to think of it,

204
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,662
there were a lot of PET bottles lined out.

205
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,362
Those are to keep cats away.

206
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:55,962
I saw that, I figured it out.

207
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:58,757
So that's what is was.

208
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,762
That map had nothing to do with any case then.

209
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:05,862
But, another question's come up.

210
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:11,862
Who could've stolen the map that was drawn for such a trivial reason?

211
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:14,762
The person who stole the map

212
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:17,262
is probably the one who killed Mr. Kouzuki.

213
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,462
What?

214
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:24,262
That person may not have known who or why the map was drawn,

215
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,462
but after Mitsuhiko showed the map

216
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:28,262
that indicated some kind of relationship with Mr. Kouzuki,

217
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:30,789
that person not wanting it to be taken to the police stole it.

218
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:33,462
Which means...

219
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:36,262
The culprit who killed Mr. Kouzuki

220
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:39,662
is one of the residents of the three houses that we visited.

221
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,062
Oh, no.

222
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,803
They key is...

223
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:45,862
the cigarette.

224
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,062
Cigarette?

225
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,162
Talking about cigarettes,

226
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:51,062
that lady called Eguchi was smoking.

227
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:52,162
Mr. Ooga too.

228
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:54,813
He tried to smoke one and was stopped by his wife.

229
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,815
Mr. Fujiki...

230
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,462
His son smokes.

231
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,762
He went out of his way to hide the cigarette that he bought

232
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:03,462
in the back pocket of his pants.

233
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,862
His mother probably doesn't like cigarettes.

234
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,962
Talking of cigarettes...

235
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:13,662
about 10 days ago around 8 in the morning.

236
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:14,833
Darn.

237
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,162
Always throwing cigarette butts down like this!

238
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:20,062
Who the heck can it be?

239
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:22,262
If I remember correctly,

240
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,262
there were two blue lines on the cigarette.

241
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,845
Two blue line?

242
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:30,162
It's the same cigarette that the three were smoking.

243
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,462
Maybe Mr. Kouzuki met the person

244
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:36,262
who was always disposing cigarettes in front of his house

245
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:38,862
at the underground crosswalk.

246
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:40,859
And, they got into a quarrel.

247
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:43,262
Then, that person is the culprit?

248
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,462
Who is it, Conan?

249
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:47,762
I don't know yet.

250
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,562
I don't have enough information.

251
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:51,662
If we check Mr. Kouzuki's house,

252
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:54,162
maybe we'll find the cigarette butts that he gathered.

253
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:58,162
No, it was probably thrown away yesterday as burnable trash.

254
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:01,462
Okay. Let's go gather information!

255
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:02,881
Okay, let's go!

256
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,883
Let's split up and carry out interrogation.

257
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:05,862
Hey.

258
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:08,887
All right. I'd like to give the one who stole the map

259
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,889
a taste of his own medicine too.

260
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,062
Not you too.

261
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:15,362
Okay.

262
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,762
Only, don't push yourself too far.

263
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,662
If you sense danger in any way,

264
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:20,899
pull out right away.

265
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,901
-Okay! -Roger!

266
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,903
You can count on us.

267
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,762
Will you draw a map for us again, Mr. Yagisawa?

268
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,907
Okay.

269
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,162
About the cigarette butts...

270
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:07,462
It seems that they were disposed of as burnable trash after all.

271
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:08,962
I see.

272
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,662
It seems that Mr. Ooga walks everyday

273
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,562
to his architecture design office

274
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,953
which is located in front of Beika Station.

275
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:18,957
He leaves his home between 7:30 am and 8:30 am.

276
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,959
He comes home at random hours,

277
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,362
and last night it seems he came home after 10:00 pm.

278
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,262
Mrs. Eguchi part-times at a club near

279
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:28,962
Beika Station four days a week from evening.

280
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,962
Club? You mean a soccer club?

281
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:32,362
It seems she came home last night after 10:00 pm too.

282
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:36,162
Mr. Fujiki also seems to going on foot to Beika Station too.

283
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,462
According to the granny living in the house opposite his,

284
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:44,983
he leaves every morning at 7:00 sharp.

285
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:48,162
She says she heard the front door close

286
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:49,462
at around after 10:00 last night.

287
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:52,762
The three commute to Beika Station.

288
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,462
And if they take this course,

289
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:57,262
they would pass in front of Mr. Kouzuki's house

290
00:16:57,262 --> 00:16:59,762
and the underground pass.

291
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:03,001
In other words, it is possible for all three of them

292
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,562
to dispose of cigarettes in front of Mr. Kouzuki's house

293
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:09,007
before 8:00 in the morning or late at night.

294
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,462
If she's not in the soccer club,

295
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,161
maybe she's in the baseball club?

296
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:15,362
I asked the cleaning man at the underground pass

297
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:17,762
and was told that he also sees the same brand cigarette butt

298
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:19,661
on the ground all the time.

299
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:21,462
Blue line.

300
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:23,021
Last night at around 10:00,

301
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:27,025
one of the three disposed of a cigarette butt at the underground pass.

302
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,027
Mr. Kouzuki who happened to see that,

303
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,029
got into an argument with that person.

304
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,462
You're the one who's always throwing cigarette butts

305
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:35,462
in front of my house.

306
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:56,062
That's why there was no cigarette butt near the corpse.

307
00:17:56,062 --> 00:18:00,462
The problem is, who of the three is the culprit?

308
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,862
Come on, what club is she in?

309
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:05,862
Oh, no!

310
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,862
Genta, how filthy!

311
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,762
I was almost finished licking it.

312
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:13,762
What a waste.

313
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:14,862
Finished licking?

314
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,362
Finished smoking.

315
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,077
Maybe...

316
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,462
But, the proof...

317
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:25,462
Hey, I've got something I want to confirm.

318
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:28,162
Let's go, all of us.

319
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:29,662
Cool too.

320
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,462
The flow of the river is fast after all.

321
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,662
Somebody's there.

322
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:56,762
It's Mrs. Eguchi.

323
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,362
What?

324
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,862
She looks different

325
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,962
because she's got make-up on.

326
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,762
She laughed.

327
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,162
Very suspicious.

328
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,262
Okay, let's follow her.

329
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,135
It's floated away.

330
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,462
The cigarette butt that would've served as evidence.

331
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,162
It'll be hard to prove.

332
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,462
Just as nasty as ever.

333
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,462
She's throwing her cigarette on the ground again.

334
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,157
What a lady.

335
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:44,862
-Good evening. -Good evening.

336
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:47,462
You're a good girl,

337
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:48,962
but you still bark.

338
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,962
Depending on the person.

339
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,171
Especially anyone who looks suspicious.

340
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,173
Ai.

341
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,862
We've got to hurry and go after Mrs. Eguchi.

342
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,762
That person is...

343
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,183
Mr. Ooga.

344
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,662
What's going on?

345
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:09,562
I see.

346
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,262
Not again.

347
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:15,662
There seems to be a woman who always litters.

348
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:16,862
Always?

349
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,203
What's up, Cool?

350
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:29,207
The men forgot to take that,

351
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,662
so I had no choice but to keep it.

352
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:33,762
Maybe...

353
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:50,362
It... it can't be.

354
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,562
I threw that cigarette into the river.

355
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:55,233
You threw a different cigarette butt into that river.

356
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,862
A different one?

357
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:58,262
Mr. Fujiki,

358
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:01,239
last night, after grabbing the cigarette butt from Mr. Kouzuki's hand,

359
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,062
you ran towards your house, didn't you?

360
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,245
Then, a black dog suddenly barked at you

361
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,247
so didn't you drop the butt?

362
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:12,162
Mr. Fujiki that was looking around

363
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,362
for the cigarette butt in the dark in a rush,

364
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:17,262
found it and picked it up.

365
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:20,562
Since it was the same brand,

366
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:21,862
as well as had a red stain on the filter,

367
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,261
thought it was the one he was looking for,

368
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,962
ran off again and threw it into the river.

369
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:30,362
But the one that Mr. Fujiki picked up was that of someone else.

370
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:32,762
What he thought was blood was lipstick.

371
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:34,862
The butt that Mr. Fujiki dropped was found

372
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:38,862
in between the recycle bin in front of the house.

373
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:15,062
Mr. Ooga had an affair with Mrs. Eguchi behind his wife's back.

374
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:19,762
Yes, that's why his facial expression changed when he saw the map.

375
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:22,262
When did you figure out he was the culprit?

376
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:24,662
I wasn't that sure.

377
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:27,662
I just assumed that the culprit started smoking the cigarette

378
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:29,387
from in front of the station.

379
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,662
It takes 400 meters to get to the underground pass,

380
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,962
so I figured that was the distance it would take

381
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,862
for the culprit to just finish smoking.

382
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,962
Then, I took a look at the house that would take

383
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:42,162
about the same distance as from Mr. Kouzuki's house.

384
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:44,262
I see.

385
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:48,662
Okay, I guess I'll give the great detective a treat then.

386
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:51,062
I don't care for anything like that.

387
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,662
What the...

388
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:56,062
Great Detective, here's your beef jerky treat.

389
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:59,417
So, she wasn't talking about me.

390
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,878
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:05,423
"Ant".

392
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,460
Next is the suspicious initial K.

393
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,427
-Me? -No.

394
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,000
-Conan, then. -No.
