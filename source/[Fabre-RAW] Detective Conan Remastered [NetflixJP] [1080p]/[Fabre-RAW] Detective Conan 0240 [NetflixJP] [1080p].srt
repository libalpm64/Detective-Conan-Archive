1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,790
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,790
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,290
Today's stage is on the Bullet train.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,490
There is another locked room in an already locked room.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,890
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,990
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,230
"Escort on the Shinkansen (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,130
"Shin-Osaka Station"

10
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,130
"World Cup Hero Arrested For Homicide"

11
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,730
I can't decide which.

12
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,930
Hey, hey.

13
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,330
Isn't that your cell phone?

14
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,330
What?

15
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,230
I wonder who it is?

16
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,330
No ID?

17
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,030
Could that be a long-awaited call from your sweetie, Shinichi?

18
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,330
What?

19
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,130
Come on, pick up and answer. He'll hang up if you don't sooner.

20
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,330
I don't have to answer a call from somebody who won't identify himself.

21
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,430
Don't be so shy. Come on.

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,130
Three's a crowd. I'm leaving.

23
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,930
Hello?

24
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,730
Shinichi?

25
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,930
Shinichi.

26
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,030
Shinichi!

27
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,830
What do you mean it's been a while?

28
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,930
Ran's dad.

29
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,430
I know what's bugging you.

30
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,730
Why should I?

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,130
Bull's-eye.

32
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,230
Like I told you.

33
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,930
I have no way of contacting you.

34
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,130
But...

35
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,430
But then, how did you know I am in Osaka?

36
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,530
Hattori called me and told me.

37
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,730
So, you're in contact with him all this time.

38
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,330
But... Just a coincidence.

39
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,230
You know, the K-3 event.

40
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,530
There was that event, right?

41
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,830
Let me see.

42
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,330
Which one should I pick?

43
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,830
Well, I don't need any lunch, so what about the newspaper?

44
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,630
Why, you just bought one a while ago!

45
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,630
What happened, Ran?

46
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,630
Well, then. Shinichi...

47
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,030
Do you know about that case?

48
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,630
I saw the news in the morning.

49
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,430
That case about Ray Curtis.

50
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,030
I couldn't believe it.

51
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,030
Kudo.

52
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,130
Well... And so, Shinichi.

53
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,630
To tell you the truth, I asked...

54
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,330
Maybe you're thinking of

55
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,930
the uniform that Ray autograph?

56
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,430
Yeah.

57
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,930
I heard about it in a phone call.

58
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,530
That wasn't necessary.

59
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,130
But...

60
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,330
Sorry, but I want you to keep it until I get home.

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,030
No matter what happened, Ray on the pitch is my hero forever.

62
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,430
Thank you, Ran.

63
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,230
Well, then, there's something I need to check into.

64
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,930
There's something, Shinichi.

65
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,030
What?

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't you want to know

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,680
how Shinichi feels about you?

68
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
What's up?

69
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,380
Do you...

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,480
Go, Ran. Say it.

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,180
Shinichi...

72
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,780
Shinichi, about me...

73
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,680
Shin Osaka Station,

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,280
Track No. 26.

75
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,380
Nozomi No. 56 departing at 14:26 for Tokyo.

76
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
I can hear the Shinkansen arriving.

77
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,480
Yes.

78
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,680
Then, I'll call you when I have the time.

79
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,780
Well... okay.

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Hey, there...

81
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Wait... The conversation hasn't been done yet.

82
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,080
Oh, no. He hung up.

83
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,380
I can't stop him.

84
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,180
He's too busy.

85
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,280
Oh, Kazuha.

86
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,980
It's you, Heiji.

87
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,880
What's that fuss about?

88
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,480
It was a phone call from Shinichi.

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,080
The line went dead when she was about to get to the point.

90
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
No! Not really!

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,980
What point?

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,480
Yeah.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,580
They were in the middle of a sweet conversation.

94
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,780
Then he must have chickened out by hanging up.

95
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,580
What?

96
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,380
You know, he's a wimp.

97
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,180
Wait till I get you.

98
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,480
"Nagoya" -No. 164 bound for Tokyo are going to leave.

99
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,980
The doors will close,

100
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,480
Ran, listen to me. Don't beat around the bush.

101
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,180
Give it to him straight! Throw cheese!

102
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,380
Okay.

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,980
Throw cheese right at the center. Hit the bulls-eye!

104
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,280
You hear me!

105
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,980
What is it, Ran?

106
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,780
Are you planning to play baseball?

107
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, yes, sort of.

108
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,080
Don't throw straight into the bull's-eye.

109
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,380
I think you should sound out strategy with a curveball.

110
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,680
No, wait.

111
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,080
Mr. Mouri.

112
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,980
Officer Takagi.

113
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,580
What?

114
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,080
You're transporting a crime suspect?

115
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,480
Turn it down, Mr. Mouri.

116
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm sorry, Takagi.

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,680
What about the guy? What did he do?

118
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,580
His name is Senzo Ogura.

119
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,780
A narcotics dealer.

120
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,780
We were about to arrest him in Tokyo,

121
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,580
but he made a narrow escape.

122
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,480
We organized a dragnet in the Kansai region, and he fell into it.

123
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,380
Yes, I remember reading it in the newspaper.

124
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,880
That such a guy is being transferred from Osaka to the Police Agency.

125
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,380
If I remember correctly,

126
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,280
a huge supply of narcotics was found in his home in Tokyo.

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,380
Yes.

128
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,480
That's why we're hoping that he'll confess the name of his boss.

129
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,980
Coffee.

130
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,780
I want to drink some coffee.

131
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,680
Boy, you are troublesome.

132
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,080
Takagi, can you go get one?

133
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,180
Yes.

134
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,680
But we can only get you cold coffee in a can.

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,180
I don't want you spilling hot coffee over us to try to escape.

136
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,480
Shit.

137
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,680
I wonder if I have a small change.

138
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,880
Here it is.

139
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,730
It's a ticket to the Ichizo Sanada Magic Illusion show.

140
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,730
Are you going to see it?

141
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,930
Yes, on my next day off.

142
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,130
I didn't know you were interested in that.

143
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,530
Well...

144
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,330
To tell you the truth,

145
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,030
Yumi in the Traffic Control Section asked me,

146
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,930
because she had an extra ticket.

147
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,330
I see.

148
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,830
Yumi did?

149
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,630
I told her I'm not really interested.

150
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,630
Well, Takagi.

151
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,130
Yes.

152
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,130
That might be a good idea. Why not?

153
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,930
Let me know if you catch the trick behind it.

154
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,830
Well...

155
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,830
How about this?

156
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,330
You casually tell Miwako that I asked you out.

157
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,030
What?

158
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,930
If she turns pale, that means she has a thing for you.

159
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,930
If she turns pale?

160
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,630
A straightforward pitch isn't going to work on a girl like Miwako.

161
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,930
Try sounding out with a curveball.

162
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,030
Get it?

163
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,630
What is it with you?

164
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,330
What? Well, I'm going.

165
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,930
We'll be returning to our seats.

166
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,430
Okay. See you later.

167
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,930
Look's like my curveball...

168
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,630
failed.

169
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,330
We should see Mt. Fuji soon.

170
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,530
What?

171
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,530
Looks like something happened.

172
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,230
What's wrong?

173
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,230
Has something happened?

174
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,130
First things first, I'll check the restroom.

175
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,630
You stay here.

176
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,030
Okay.

177
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,530
Excuse me. Let me through.

178
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,130
It's here.

179
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,830
"Contains Bomb. Do not touch".

180
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,830
When did you find this?

181
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,380
A passenger found this just a while ago,

182
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,580
I think it hasn't been very long.

183
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I see.

184
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,980
Thanks.

185
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,530
It seems people are gathering over there.

186
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,230
There must be something going on.

187
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,830
You must be kidding.

188
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,330
I think I'll go and check.

189
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,830
Stop!

190
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,830
No! It's dangerous.

191
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,530
Sit still.

192
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,930
Hey, officer.

193
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,630
I need to go to the restroom.

194
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,630
What?

195
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,630
I've been trying to wait until we get to Tokyo, but I can't anymore.

196
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,330
Then, wait till Officer Sato returns.

197
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,030
I'm telling you because I can't anymore.

198
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,130
It's okay by me if I do it here.

199
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,930
No way.

200
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,930
Seriously.

201
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,330
I'm sorry about that.

202
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,430
Seriously.

203
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,580
Where are you heading, Officer Takagi?

204
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,480
The bathroom.

205
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,580
Did you find something, officer?

206
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,980
Do you hear something?

207
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,580
Yes, I hear the clock ticking.

208
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Anyway, we must have the passengers evacuate from the car.

209
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,380
Tell the driver to stop the train.

210
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,380
It was just a hoax.

211
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,980
I'd like to speak to the person who found this bag.

212
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
Hey!

213
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,780
Are you done?

214
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,680
Don't rush me, officer.

215
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,780
I've only got one hand free.

216
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,880
That's a problem in itself.

217
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,280
Goodness.

218
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,480
By the way, I heard you say something

219
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,580
that you are going to make me confess the boss's name.

220
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm sorry to tell you that it's impossible.

221
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Because this bird won't be singing anymore.

222
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,080
What's going on?

223
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,080
What's this?

224
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,880
How did you get the knife?

225
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,980
I need to call Ms. Sato.

226
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,180
Oh, no!

227
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,380
I'm out of range in a tunnel.

228
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
Darn it.

229
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,380
I'll be back right away!

230
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,080
I'll be back. Stay there.

231
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,080
What did you say?

232
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,580
The suspect in the restroom?

233
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,980
He had a knife stabbed in the abdomen.

234
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,380
But why?

235
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,980
He shouldn't be in possession of a knife.

236
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,880
I know, but...

237
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,980
But, when I opened the door, he was splattered with blood.

238
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,480
Anyway, please come.

239
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,980
All right.

240
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,180
Officer Sato, here!

241
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,280
It's gone. The knife is gone.

242
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
What?

243
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,280
It's too late.

244
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,380
He already died.

245
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,580
No way...

246
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,780
Strange.

247
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,680
There is something fishy here.

248
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,380
What?

249
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,480
The suspect killed himself during transport?

250
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
Idiots!

251
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,380
What have you two been doing?

252
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,980
Well, starting from the beginning,

253
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,780
I took the suspect to the bathroom.

254
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,280
Suddenly, he began to suffer.

255
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,730
When I opened the door,

256
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,530
he had a knife in his abdomen and he was bloody.

257
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,330
That is why I went to report to Officer Sato to receive orders.

258
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,430
I locked the handcuff on the handbar in the bathroom.

259
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,830
I had him confined inside the bathroom to call Officer Sato.

260
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,030
Although he was injured,

261
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,430
I believed that it is dangerous to have a suspect

262
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,130
in possession of a weapon to be left abandoned inside the car.

263
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,630
When I returned with Officer Sato,

264
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,330
he had pulled out the knife and was bleeding.

265
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,230
Anyway, I will be heading to Tokyo Station

266
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,730
with the medical examiner and forensic team.

267
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,930
Don't let anybody inside until we get there.

268
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,530
Yes, sir!

269
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,830
A police officer making the mistake of allowing

270
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,630
a suspect to commit suicide during transport.

271
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,530
That's a scandal.

272
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,530
This means reprimand or a pay cut or even suspension.

273
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,830
No, no.

274
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,530
It might mean...

275
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,930
a dishonorable discharge.

276
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,730
Poor Officer Takagi!

277
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,630
What are you saying, Officer Sato?

278
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,630
You're speaking as it's no concern of yours.

279
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,430
Hello, Takagi speaking!

280
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,430
Hi, it's me, Yumi.

281
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,330
Yumi?

282
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,630
How was it? You know what.

283
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,330
What?

284
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,730
The operation ticket chase!

285
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,230
Did it succeeds?

286
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,330
Was Miwako jealous? How did she react?

287
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,830
Come on and tell me. I'm dying to hear.

288
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,430
I'm not in the mood to talk about that!

289
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,830
Don't call me about such matters!

290
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,530
It bombed as expected.

291
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,130
What did Yumi say?

292
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,430
It was nothing.

293
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,730
But, the problem is the knife used to kill himself.

294
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,430
Yes, he is not a magician.

295
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,030
It's impossible for a suspect to hide and carry a knife during transport

296
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,530
-without the police officers knowing. -He's not a magician.

297
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,830
This man is a samurai.

298
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,230
What?

299
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,130
Look at the knife on the floor.

300
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,830
Look at how it is on the floor. The blade is looking upward.

301
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,530
It means he was holding it this way, right?

302
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,730
This means that this man was holding the knife

303
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,730
this away to pull it out like a samurai.

304
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,630
Takagi.

305
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,530
How did the suspect hold the knife when he stabbed himself?

306
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,430
Of course, in reverse,

307
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,930
it's easier to hold that way.

308
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,630
Reverse when stabbing,

309
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,530
and normal when pulling,

310
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,230
that's weird.

311
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,030
Does that mean that someone else had pulled the knife?

312
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,430
That's impossible.

313
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,330
Talking about weird,

314
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,630
this blood is funny, too.

315
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,230
-What? -What?

316
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,530
Look, the blood splattered all over the man

317
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,930
and the blood on the knife.

318
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,030
It is wiggling like jelly.

319
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,730
But, the blood on his hand is not hard yet

320
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,730
and is liquid like water.

321
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,330
Does that mean that what is on his hand is not blood?

322
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,930
But the color looks so much like blood.

323
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,030
Might be heparin.

324
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,230
Heparin?

325
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,230
Yes.

326
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,530
It may have been mixed with blood.

327
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,830
You mean, that anti-coagulant?

328
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,930
Yes.

329
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,730
Usually, blood begins to clot over time,

330
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,130
making it difficult to transport.

331
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,830
If blood is mixed with Heparin and sealed tight in a bag,

332
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,530
it is possible to bring it in on the train to use as fake blood.

333
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,330
If it means fake blood, then...

334
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,230
Yes. If somebody had concealed the fake blood

335
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,930
and knife in here.

336
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,130
This is truly...

337
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,030
murder.

338
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,500
Next Conan's Hint:

339
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
