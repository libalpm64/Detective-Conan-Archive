1
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:06,956
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:08,656
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:10,556
Ran's suspicion has finally come to the truth.

4
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:12,156
The password brings her even closer to the truth.

5
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:13,856
It's a one-on-one battle between love and deduction.

6
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:15,456
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:16,956
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:19,156
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:09,718
I'm done.

10
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,318
It was delicious.

11
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:14,718
Then off to bed you go. It's already after midnight.

12
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,718
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,218
Wait.

14
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:22,118
What is it, Ran?

15
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:26,118
Well, you know...

16
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:28,818
Brush your teeth and go to sleep now.

17
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:31,118
Yes, I know.

18
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,018
What's with him?

19
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,118
He seems oddly jittery.

20
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:40,318
I guess he sort of realize it after all.

21
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,918
That I'm suspicious of his true identity.

22
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:46,318
Shinichi.

23
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,418
Oh, no.

24
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,918
I may have forgotten to lock the door of the office.

25
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,018
Make sure you lock it before going to bed then.

26
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:57,318
Boy, I am sleepy.

27
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:05,018
There's only one way for me to check...

28
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:18,218
whether what I suspect is true or not.

29
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:30,818
"Suspicious Ran"

30
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,118
I've got to go return the car.

31
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:41,118
Okay.

32
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,918
Conan's cell phone.

33
00:03:56,918 --> 00:04:01,018
If the mail that I sent is inside,

34
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:04,018
it'll serve as a definite evidence that Conan is Shinichi.

35
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,818
Just as I thought.

36
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,618
The cell phone is switched off

37
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,418
so that the sound of my mail sent out to him won't ring.

38
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,418
But you've no choice already, Shinichi.

39
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:16,418
Once the cell phone's switched on, everything will become clear.

40
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,218
Wait. Is this what you really want?

41
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,318
What if Conan is really Shinichi?

42
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:26,218
How are you going to face up to him?

43
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:28,118
This boy...

44
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,018
is cute.

45
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:33,418
My heart...

46
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,918
He is a deduction freak who has always been mean since his childhood days

47
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:38,418
and always full of confidence.

48
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:41,618
But he has always been there in time of need.

49
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,418
He's so cool.

50
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,618
I like Shinichi more than anyone else.

51
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:51,918
I can't sleep.

52
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,918
It was sure a lot of fun washing each other's back, wasn't it?

53
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,718
Your nose is bleeding? Maybe the water was too hot?

54
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:05,218
Maybe I should just wait until he decides to tell me.

55
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,618
He must have a reason.

56
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:10,818
And besides, it's not nice peeking into other people's cell phone.

57
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:16,318
But all I'm going to do is check whether the mail I sent is inside or not.

58
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:19,118
If that's all I'm going to do, it's okay, isn't it?

59
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,718
Sorry, Shinichi.

60
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,418
I see.

61
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:29,718
Just as I expected.

62
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:33,418
But most of the times, the password would be his birthday or something.

63
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,918
I guess it's not all that simple.

64
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,918
Now what?

65
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,718
There are 10,000 possible matches for 4 digit numbers,

66
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:47,818
and it would take at least 8 hours to try them all out.

67
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:49,918
What other possibility could there be?

68
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,418
Maybe my birthday?

69
00:05:56,418 --> 00:06:00,118
How silly. Of course not.

70
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:06,818
Impossible.

71
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:08,518
That's impossible.

72
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:11,018
But I guess there's no harm trying, right?

73
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,918
Mine is...

74
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,618
But what shall I do?

75
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:22,618
If it is, what should I do?

76
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:31,018
I see. It's not after all.

77
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,218
What number is it?

78
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:40,618
Tell me what it is.

79
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,918
No, Ran. Cool down your head.

80
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,918
It seems they both went to sleep.

81
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,218
Nobody will bother me here.

82
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:55,118
And a slight sound won't be heard.

83
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:57,418
I've got all the time in the world, too.

84
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:08,218
2036, 2037.

85
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:11,318
2038, 2039.

86
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:14,218
2040, 2041.

87
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,318
2042.

88
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,618
No good.

89
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:23,118
At this rate, it's going to take me till morning.

90
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,518
I guess I'll just have to try to figure out

91
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,818
the numbers that Shinichi is most likely to use.

92
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:28,418
Let's see...

93
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:32,118
He likes Holmes.

94
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,018
Maybe the number is the year in which Holmes handled a case?

95
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:38,618
No, that can't be it.

96
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:42,418
Because I checked all the numbers from 1 to over 2,000 just a while ago.

97
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,118
Gosh. That noise!

98
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,018
Hello it says (46-49, yoroshiku).

99
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,518
What a jerk. Being noisy at this time of night.

100
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:10,518
Come to think of it a while back...

101
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:19,618
Love romance movies are great after all.

102
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,418
They're really touching.

103
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:26,218
Plagiarism. Touch up.

104
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:29,018
That actress was really beautiful.

105
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,518
Ugly.

106
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,918
What? Ugly?

107
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:35,618
No, maybe it's "big brother goes..."

108
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:38,818
Just what're you talking about, Shinichi?

109
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,718
What? The number plate of that car.

110
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:42,818
What?

111
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:45,818
10-39 is pronounced as "tosaku" (plagiarism),

112
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,418
and the other car's plate is 23-19

113
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:49,818
which is pronounced as "busaiku" (ugly)

114
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:52,318
or pronounced "nii-san iku" (big brother goes).

115
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:55,018
In other words, I'm playing words with the number on cars' plate.

116
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,718
What are you doing something like?

117
00:08:56,718 --> 00:09:00,418
Exercising my brain because I'm a detective.

118
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:03,018
It also serves as practice for solving codes.

119
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,218
Oh, my.

120
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:06,718
34-2 stands for "misshitsu" (behind closed-doors).

121
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,418
93-89 stands for "kusayakyu" (amateur baseball).

122
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,718
48-6?

123
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:15,018
Pronounced as "yowamushi" (weakling).

124
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,518
89-31.

125
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:17,718
Pronounced as "hakusai" (Chinese cabbage).

126
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:20,518
It's amazing that you can think it up one after the other.

127
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,418
The one that made me laugh the other day was...

128
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:24,318
Despite it being a flower shop vehicle,

129
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:26,318
the number plate was 80-83.

130
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,418
80-83?

131
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:32,118
"Yaoya-san" (A vegetable shop)?

132
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,118
Yes.

133
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:36,418
A flower shop should be 87-8.

134
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,018
You can say that again.

135
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,818
Oh, wait.

136
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:44,618
Meat shop is 29-83.

137
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,418
And fish shop is 37-83, right?

138
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:48,918
There's still more, Ran.

139
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:52,118
A bath shop is 26-8.

140
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,618
And bean curd shop without the "san" at the end would be...

141
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:56,618
-10-2. -10-2.

142
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,518
Recently, people get to choose the numbers they want to use

143
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,718
for their number plates as long as they request it,

144
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:08,718
but before this law was passed, there were no numbers ending in 42 or 49.

145
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:10,718
Why not?

146
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,518
42 is pronounced as "shining" (dead person).

147
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:15,418
And 49 is pronounced as "shako" (death and suffering).

148
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:18,018
Dead people? Death and suffering?

149
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,218
But recently, people doesn't seem to be bothered by things like that.

150
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:24,818
See, look at that.

151
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:28,018
46-49 or pronounced as "yoroshiku" (hello) seems to be quite popular.

152
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,018
The numbers that are really popular

153
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:35,818
can't be acquired unless you win the lottery for the numbers.

154
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,818
For instance, 11-22.

155
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:40,718
11-22?

156
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,418
Pronounced as "iifufu" (a married couple who gets along great).

157
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:44,218
See, look over there.

158
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,018
A married couple who gets along great.

159
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:57,618
I sure would like Dad to use a number like that if he ever buys a car.

160
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:05,318
No. Your Dad's taste would be something like...

161
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:08,818
10-70 or 81-09.

162
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:12,318
10-70 or 81-09?

163
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,718
10-70 pronounced as "ii onna" (foxy lady)

164
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,118
or 81-09 pronounced as "hairegu" (high cut revealing outfit)!

165
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:17,318
Gosh! How rude.

166
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:24,618
Shinichi, what numbers would you prefer?

167
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,718
Huh?

168
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,418
41-910 for Shinichi Kudo.

169
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:31,418
-Huh? -There's one extra number there.

170
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:37,018
I get it. 41-1.

171
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:39,618
41-10...

172
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:40,918
That's quite good.

173
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,618
Right?

174
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,018
But too bad.

175
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:45,318
Huh?

176
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,118
Hiragana characters can't be chosen.

177
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:48,118
Moreover,

178
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:50,018
the Hiraganas that are in the "A" and "KA" rows of the Japanese alphabet

179
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,818
cannot be used for cars for private use.

180
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:54,018
Is that so?

181
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,718
Well, if I were to choose, it would be...

182
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,818
That car...

183
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:04,818
Shinichi?

184
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,518
What about that car?

185
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,318
Hey.

186
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:13,118
Watch out.

187
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:14,918
Please sit down.

188
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,918
Shoots.

189
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:24,318
Driver, can you...

190
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:25,818
Of course he can't go after that car.

191
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:29,918
We'll be stopping at the next stop.

192
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,918
Hey. What's up, Shinichi?

193
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,318
Shinichi?

194
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,960
Darn it!

195
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,460
Officer!

196
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,860
A car with a fraudulent license plate just went by.

197
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,360
A fraudulent license plate?

198
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,660
It's a black sedan with the plate number "Shinjuku 510-shi 15-64".

199
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,060
But how do you know that the car has a fraudulent license plate number?

200
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,360
15-64 pronounced as "hitogoroshi" (murderer).

201
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,060
I mean you guys, just because the number can be read as "murderer"...

202
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,360
The point is not the numbers, but rather, the Hiragana character.

203
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,460
There should be no license plate numbers

204
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,760
with the characters "shi" and "he".

205
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,060
Going around like that with a fraudulent license plate numbers

206
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,860
shows that they've planned out a crime and are about to execute it.

207
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,460
You've got to go after them!

208
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,560
Okay.

209
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,560
Leave it to me!

210
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,060
Ran, you should go home.

211
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,360
Shinichi.

212
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,460
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

213
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,860
Shinichi.

214
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,860
So what happened after that?

215
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,260
I was worried.

216
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,760
Sorry, sorry.

217
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Those guys fell under the category number 510 and not 15-64.

218
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
510?

219
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
It's "goto" (robber).

220
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,360
But thanks to my deduction it ended with just an attempt.

221
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,260
So they were arrested?

222
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,460
Sort of. Those idiots used numbers

223
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:09,060
that symbolized "robber and murderer" to challenge the police.

224
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,760
But placing "shi" on the number plate was taking it a bit too far.

225
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,060
By the way, about your father,

226
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,860
if he were to choose a number plate, how about 55-45?

227
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,660
55-45?

228
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,460
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

229
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,260
Shinichi.

230
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,660
Hey, Dad. If you were to buy a car...

231
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,260
Shut up. Yoko Okino's coming on air soon.

232
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,360
Yoko!

233
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,160
You viewers out there get to see my live concert today!

234
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,060
Go! Go!

235
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,760
Let's go, Yoko!

236
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,160
Yoko... Go, go...

237
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,860
It's 55-45 (Go! Go! Yoko).

238
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
5545.

239
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,460
I'll try it, just in case.

240
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,860
I guess not. After all he's not Dad.

241
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,260
But back then, if I remember it correctly...

242
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,860
Well, if I were to choose, it would be...

243
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,760
I wonder what Shinichi was trying to say.

244
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,060
If it's a four digit number, he could be using it as a password.

245
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,260
But it might be a good idea to it out.

246
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,860
For instance...

247
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,260
Right. Like 4062 for Holmes.

248
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,460
No good. It's still locked.

249
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Lock.

250
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,060
Right, Holmes' first name is Sherlock.

251
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,760
4862.

252
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,460
Well, I guess I'll try it.

253
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,060
What?

254
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,160
Seriuosly? It opened!

255
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,460
What shall I do? What shall I do?

256
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,260
Oh, no.

257
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,960
I've unlocked it.

258
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,060
I've got to check.

259
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,360
I've got to check whether he received my mail or not.

260
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,960
My mail isn't here?

261
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,460
I see. He deleted it just in case.

262
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,360
But that won't work cautious detective!

263
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,360
All I have to do is re-send this morning's mail to find out.

264
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,160
Huh? It's not coming in.

265
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,260
Why?

266
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,460
Why?

267
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,060
How strange. The mail address is correct.

268
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,460
Strange.

269
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,960
The telephone!

270
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Telephone?

271
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,960
Yes, hello?

272
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,160
What is it?

273
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,260
What?

274
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,060
Sending the same mail over and over.

275
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,160
What's the matter with you?

276
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,460
Shinichi?

277
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,860
Just what time do you think it is now?

278
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
It's in the middle of the night you know?

279
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,960
Who is it?

280
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm working day in and day out on cases and are fast asleep.

281
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,660
Until you call and wake me up.

282
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Conan?

283
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
Do you know where my cell phone is?

284
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,260
I've been searching for it for a while.

285
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,160
Isn't that mine?

286
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,460
-Think about me, will you? -Sorry.

287
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,660
I picked it up in the car, and forgot to tell you about it.

288
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,760
Huh?

289
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,560
It was supposed to have been locked.

290
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,860
Did you look inside?

291
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,160
Nope.

292
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,560
I didn't look inside.

293
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,360
But why are you so concerned?

294
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,660
Because mails from the girl I like are in here, too.

295
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,560
Oh, I see. Right.

296
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,760
Let me give you a piece of my mind.

297
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,860
Goodnight.

298
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,560
Okay, goodnight.

299
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,460
You've always been like that.

300
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,260
-I see, that's why Conan was so flustered. -Hey, are you listening?

301
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,460
-He didn't want me to see the mails he received from girls. -I'm sleepy.

302
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,260
You keep on repeating the same thing over and over and over.

303
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,060
Tell me once and I get the message.

304
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,960
Hey, Ran. Are you listening?

305
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,860
What was that mail about anyway?

306
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

307
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,260
I must've been mistaken about something again.

308
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,060
I'm sure glad Doc's cell phone was the same type as mine.

309
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,260
You can't tell the difference between the two

310
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,160
after the straps are exchanged.

311
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,460
It sure took a while before I got mail from Ran though.

312
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,860
I locked the cell phone to buy time,

313
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,060
but maybe the password 4869 (Sherlock) was a bit too difficult.

314
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,560
But that's the word numbers I could find

315
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,360
that was common for both Conan and I.

316
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm so happy I got to hear Shinichi's voice after such a long time.

317
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,560
Because even if I want to hear his voice,

318
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,660
it's hard for me to get a hold of him from my side.

319
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Please don't get me wrong.

320
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,060
There's no deep meaning to it.

321
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,760
You idiot. Take a good look at your cell phone display.

322
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,160
What? This is...

323
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,460
This is your phone number, Shinichi?

324
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,560
You mean, you don't mind giving it to me?

325
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,060
I may call you at the wrong time, you know?

326
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,460
No.

327
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,960
But I'm so busy that most times all you'll get is my answerphone.

328
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,160
I figured that sometimes there are things that can't be relayed correctly

329
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,360
unless they are spoken.

330
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,360
That's right.

331
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,560
It's a bit risky telling her what my number is, but...

332
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,860
Well, if it's this kind of risk,

333
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,760
it's worth it.

334
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,860
Hey, what's with you two? Didn't you guys get enough sleep?

335
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,160
Well, sort of.

336
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,460
I couldn't help but remembered about a case that happened half a year ago.

337
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,360
Half a year ago?

338
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,260
What's the license number plate of Mother's car, Dad?

339
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
Eri's?

340
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,760
I think it was "Shinjuku"...

341
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,260
It's "36-ge 87-07".

342
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,160
What? The Hiragana "ge"?

343
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,360
Look at that. "36-ge 87-07."

344
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,160
See! What a revolting woman!

345
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,060
Gosh. Dad!

346
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,160
Well, I guess they'll continue living separated for a while yet.

347
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,860
22-97 (tsuzuku-na) which means will continue.

348
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,260
Conan, what did you just say? Something about continuing?

349
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
What?

350
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,087
Next Conan's Hint:

351
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,287
"Broche"

352
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,487
Coming up next is the 510 incident.

353
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:39,487
I got it, a person named Goto is the culprit.

354
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,087
It's a robbery (goto) case.
