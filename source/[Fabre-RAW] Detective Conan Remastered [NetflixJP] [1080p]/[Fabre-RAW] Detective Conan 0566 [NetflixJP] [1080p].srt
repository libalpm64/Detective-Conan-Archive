1
00:00:01,517 --> 00:00:06,617
Sweet Potato!

2
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,517
-Delicious Potato! -Here you go.

3
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:09,717
I bet it's real good.

4
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:13,017
-Piping Hot! -Geez.

5
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,417
You think crying can solve everything?

6
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:19,617
It's hot, so you need to blow on it before you eat it.

7
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,017
Like this. Here, have a bite!

8
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:28,317
Where... Where'd you go?

9
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,017
Santa?

10
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:33,017
The kid's two years old, name's Santa.

11
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,517
About this tall.

12
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:37,717
Blue clothes and green pants.

13
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:40,117
Santa!

14
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,317
Where are you?

15
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,617
-Santa! -Be quiet.

16
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:48,217
Santa!

17
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:55,017
Santa!

18
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:57,517
Watch out!

19
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:05,517
There...

20
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,717
This isn't good, Santa!

21
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:10,817
You can't just do whatever you want.

22
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:12,717
There...

23
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:15,217
What? You want to look at the cars?

24
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,917
No...

25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,217
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:28,317
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,317
A little companion with a cute name.

28
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:32,317
Conan's troublesome partner!

29
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:34,117
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:36,117
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,317
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:25,045
"Santa, My Companion"

33
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:28,445
-One, two... -Dad told you to?

34
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,845
Yes, he told me to watch this kid.

35
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,845
-Go on ahead. -Okay!

36
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:40,345
-One, two... -One, two...

37
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,145
What's your name?

38
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:44,545
Santa!

39
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:46,645
Santa?

40
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,645
You add honorific to your own name?

41
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,345
How old are you?

42
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,545
Two years old?

43
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,445
How cute!

44
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:03,245
Ran!

45
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,645
Dad?

46
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,345
So you're here, too.

47
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,445
-Mommy! -Conan!

48
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:10,545
You watched the kid like I told you to, right?

49
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,245
Yes.

50
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,845
Well, let me introduce her.

51
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,545
This is Ms. Shigeko Ishikawa.

52
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:21,145
"Shigeko Ishikawa (30)" -Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,045
What?

54
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,045
You were pushed over?

55
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,445
At the pedestrian bridge?

56
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:32,245
Yes, a person wearing a full-face helmet pushed me over from behind.

57
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:36,345
I deliver clothes from a laundry shop as a part time job.

58
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,545
When I was in the middle of a delivery...

59
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:47,545
And that's when I happened to walk by.

60
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,145
It's a good thing she wasn't hurt,

61
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:51,645
but over the past few days

62
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:54,845
something suspicious has been going, she said.

63
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:58,145
I've been getting this feeling

64
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:00,245
of being constantly watched.

65
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:06,945
If he only watching from a distance, it wouldn't be a problem,

66
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,845
but pushing her over...

67
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,345
We undoubtedly have a case here.

68
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:14,345
Noticing this, I ordered Conan to watch out for the kid.

69
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:16,745
And I proceeded my investigation.

70
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,445
You're too much.

71
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,145
Are there any other family members around?

72
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:23,145
No, my husband died last year.

73
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:25,645
It's just me and my child.

74
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:28,945
Mr. Mouri, I know you're busy, and I'm sorry to bother you.

75
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,945
Don't say such a thing.

76
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:33,245
I am a single father with a kid, too.

77
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,845
I am living a life similar to yours.

78
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:38,845
Should anything bad happen to you,

79
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,745
this kid would be left all alone!

80
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,845
Something as troublesome as that

81
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,245
would never to tolerated by my conscience!

82
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,245
Never!

83
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:50,145
I know how you feel, but even if she's a beauty

84
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:51,945
I think you're getting carried away.

85
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:54,845
Say, do you have any idea

86
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,745
who the person with the full-face helmet is?

87
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,845
No. Not a clue.

88
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:00,845
Well, let's go!

89
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:05,145
I'll find that bastard and grab him by the neck!

90
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,345
One, two...

91
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:10,845
Hey...

92
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:19,445
Relax your shoulders and act as calmly as you can.

93
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:23,345
-Do not alert them to my presence. -Sure.

94
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,745
Alright. It's perfect so far.

95
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:44,545
"Mouri Detective Agency"

96
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:49,045
Darn, you're bringing me trouble after trouble.

97
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:51,845
Do you have a grudge against me or what?

98
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:09,645
On to the next news.

99
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:14,345
An adorable baby panda has been born in the zoo yesterday.

100
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:17,545
According to Suzuki, the zookeeper...

101
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,145
Good morning, I'm from Sun Sun Cleaning.

102
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:24,545
-Please come in. -Excuse me.

103
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,545
"Mouri Detective Agency"

104
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:35,045
Darn, why'd you do that?

105
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,045
What's wrong, Santa?

106
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,145
Potty?

107
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:46,145
Wait, hold it for a while.

108
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:48,245
Not yet...

109
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,445
-For me? -Yes.

110
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,045
Melted candy?

111
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:08,045
Potty, thankies!

112
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:10,845
No problem, don't mention it.

113
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:13,045
But I guess that was a surprise.

114
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:15,645
-What a turn of events. -Conan!

115
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,245
That kid is all right?

116
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,745
Santa!

117
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:21,145
Conan!

118
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,545
Santa!

119
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,245
What is it? Pop?

120
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,345
Conan!

121
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,845
You all right!

122
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:30,445
Shigeko was taken by a man!

123
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,345
-Taken? -Yes.

124
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,645
That bastard hid himself in her customer's house and jumped her!

125
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:39,845
What the heck is he thinking attacking a housewife like that?

126
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,245
Boy, I'm with you.

127
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,245
I'm reporting it to the police.

128
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:46,845
So don't worry!

129
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,045
Okay!

130
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:55,045
Well, have you found Shigeko Ishikawa yet?

131
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:56,345
No.

132
00:08:56,345 --> 00:09:00,045
We found traces of blood in the backseat of the car.

133
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,945
She might have struggled and hurt herself.

134
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:06,745
The car was stolen from Haido City five days ago.

135
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,645
We received a report for this.

136
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,645
That full-face helmet guy again?

137
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,445
Judging from the untouched cash,

138
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:18,345
we can assume that the culprit's aim wasn't money.

139
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,045
Shigeko is quite a beauty.

140
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:24,045
The culprit may have taken a fancy to her,

141
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,845
but then he couldn't bottle up his desires anymore and took action.

142
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:29,545
It's a case involving twisted love!

143
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:30,745
Unforgiveable!

144
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:33,545
But would you push over someone you love?

145
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:36,145
Hey, Conan! How many times have I told you now?

146
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,745
You stay out of this!

147
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,145
Scat!

148
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,445
Fine!

149
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:45,045
Her bag was open and her things fell out.

150
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,545
No! They were scattered.

151
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,045
Was that guy after something in the bag?

152
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,445
Thank you, Santa.

153
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:13,645
As I thought.

154
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,545
The culprit was looking for something.

155
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:19,245
It happened around 1:30 pm.

156
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:23,045
Did he obtain the key after kidnapping Shigeko?

157
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,345
And what was the culprit looking for?

158
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,345
A bird feather?

159
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,045
Why is it there?

160
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:37,045
Santa, good afternoon.

161
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:38,945
I've brought a present for you.

162
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,345
What happened? It's a mess here.

163
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:44,145
We were just playing pro wrestling.

164
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,345
Are you friends with this kid, sir?

165
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,345
Yes.

166
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,745
"Minoru Moriwaki (22)" -I live upstairs.

167
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:50,545
My name's Minoru Moriwaki.

168
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,545
A vet med student at Beika University.

169
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:53,545
Nice to meet you.

170
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:56,845
Say, do they keep birds in this place?

171
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,645
I found this in the room,

172
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,245
but this place was locked,

173
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,745
so I wonder where it could've come from?

174
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:07,045
Perhaps it stuck on someone's body and got here that way.

175
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,445
For example, maybe on you or Santa.

176
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:13,445
Transfer from someone's body?

177
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,945
Could it be from the culprits?

178
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:19,345
I think this is the feather from a Japanese white-eye.

179
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,345
Let's take a look at Santa's bird book, shall we?

180
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:25,845
Book, look!

181
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,745
See, it's white around their eyes, thus the name white-eye.

182
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,645
They're in the passer family.

183
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,945
There's a bird called black-eye, too!

184
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,045
Oh, they're an endangered species.

185
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,545
I gave you a white-eye figure

186
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:42,545
from the capsule vending machine the other day, didn't I?

187
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,945
My friend, present!

188
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:47,145
You gave it away as a present?

189
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:51,245
A white-eye's feather and a white-eye figure.

190
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,845
Both involve the white-eye.

191
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,245
Do these coinciding facts have anything to do

192
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:58,845
with Shigeko's kidnapping?

193
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:00,345
Santa.

194
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,345
Which friend did you give the white-eye to as a present?

195
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:07,945
There, there and here!

196
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:11,045
What? You gave them everywhere.

197
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,045
Santa, which way?

198
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:23,445
The place where your friend is waiting for your present?

199
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:26,545
-Here! -It hurts...

200
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,045
It hurts.

201
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,745
At this rate I'm gonna get bunny ears.

202
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:43,345
Look.

203
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,645
No, they don't look like culprit.

204
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,745
I said don't pull my ears!

205
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,045
Look.

206
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,645
It hurts...

207
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:58,545
It hurts... So you'd like me to go straight?

208
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,045
-It's cute! -I want to see...

209
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:08,545
Santa, which way are we going?

210
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,245
What's wrong?

211
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:12,945
Santa, please wake up.

212
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,845
We're not quite finished here, Santa!

213
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,045
Sleepy...

214
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,745
I know you're tired,

215
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,945
but please try to stay awake for a while.

216
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:25,945
No! Sleepy...

217
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:28,645
I'm the one who wants to cry.

218
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,145
Pop Candy.

219
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:38,945
Pop Candy?

220
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,645
You mean the man who gave you this?

221
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:43,245
Yes!

222
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:44,645
I see.

223
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,645
"Yamanaka"

224
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,045
This is?

225
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,645
"Shop, 27th, 5 pm"

226
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,845
Today at 5 pm at the shop?

227
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,645
4:30 pm.

228
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,545
I don't have much time.

229
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,045
Santa, you all right?

230
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,345
About your neighbor Mr. Yamanaka,

231
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,245
does he own a pet shop?

232
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:30,145
Yes, I've heard previously that he was selling birds and goldfish.

233
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:33,145
Could you please tell me the location and the name of the shop?

234
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:34,345
Please!

235
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:37,445
I think it was Beika City's 3rd District?

236
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:40,445
But it seems his shop already went bankrupt.

237
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:43,445
He's going to the shop that went bankrupt at 5 pm.

238
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:46,645
Could it be that Santa's mom is there?

239
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:56,845
Enjoying this, aren't you?

240
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,245
Well, beats crying at me.

241
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:02,645
"Pet Shop Yamanaka"

242
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,945
So that's why.

243
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:14,845
I actually prevented the kid from chasing that Pop Candy.

244
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,845
No wonder this little one was upset.

245
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:30,645
Hey, sir!

246
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,845
What is it, you kids?

247
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,445
We're looking for someone.

248
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:37,345
The mother of Santa...

249
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:40,345
-She's here, isn't she? -I don't think so.

250
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,945
Except for me, no one else is here.

251
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:45,545
I'm sorry but I'm very busy.

252
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,145
Can you please leave?

253
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,545
Say, about that bird in the cage,

254
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,245
isn't it a black-eye?

255
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,845
Black-eye?

256
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,945
No, it's a white-eye.

257
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,545
Is that so?

258
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,745
It's written right here.

259
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:02,145
The black-eye species is protected by our country.

260
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:05,845
It gets its name from the black patch around its eyes.

261
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:09,845
The yellow feathers from the neck to its chest are its characteristic.

262
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,245
Its favorite food is papaya.

263
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:13,945
No, it's wrong!

264
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:18,145
If that bird is really a black-eye, the endangered species...

265
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,045
It could sell for a fortune, right?

266
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,645
I said go home!

267
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:25,145
Sir, you were in this kid's home, weren't you?

268
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:28,345
This feather had fallen in the room.

269
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,445
My guess is it got stuck on your clothes

270
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:32,645
and was transferred there.

271
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,045
No! I don't remember!

272
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:37,745
Sir, I think you'll get a lighter punishment

273
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,945
if you turn yourself into the police.

274
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,445
The police?

275
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:45,045
Why do I have to go to the police?

276
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,345
I don't have time for kids!

277
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,645
If you don't leave, you'll regret it!

278
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:52,045
Listen to me for a little bit more.

279
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,545
I think you misunderstood.

280
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:55,745
About what?

281
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,645
This figure was near the door, right?

282
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:01,945
The one who put it there was Santa.

283
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:04,145
Santa.

284
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:05,645
This kid?

285
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:09,445
Sir, you gave Santa a piece of candy before, right?

286
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,645
This was a gift for you.

287
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:12,945
A gift?

288
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:16,145
The reason for the name "Santa"

289
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,745
is because this kid loves Santa Claus.

290
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:22,545
That why this kid wants to give others presents, too.

291
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:24,545
Santa Claus...

292
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,545
Presents?

293
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,745
The one who placed it there was this kid?

294
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:33,145
As a present...

295
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,345
I see.

296
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,945
That's what it was.

297
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:40,845
Sir, this Santa loves you very much.

298
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,845
I think you are highly trusted.

299
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,845
You can't let Santa cry, now can you?

300
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,345
Santa,

301
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:54,045
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:05,145
Mama!

303
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:07,745
My shop hasn't been doing well,

304
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:10,645
and my debts grew larger and larger.

305
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,845
That's why I didn't want others to find out,

306
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:17,545
and fled to the mountains in Ogasawara.

307
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,845
I found a black-eye there.

308
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:24,545
A bird that was said to be extinct from that Island.

309
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,145
So Kurata, the man I borrowed money from

310
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:32,345
said he'd sell it for me to an upstart colleague of his who loves animals.

311
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,845
But, soon afterward,

312
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:38,245
a black-eye figure is paced at my door by someone.

313
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:43,545
Then, I saw that woman walk away with a suggestive smile,

314
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:45,945
as if she knew everything.

315
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:49,345
That woman must've noticed the black-eye!

316
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:54,445
I thought the figure and her smile were a silent threat.

317
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:57,245
I was only getting my child back.

318
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:01,545
But you hired that media-buzzing detective.

319
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,745
I didn't want my deal to be broken off,

320
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,045
so I thought that, if you had any evidence against me,

321
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,945
I'd take it away. That's why I searched your home.

322
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,445
Santa was smiling so cutely

323
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,745
while looking into the capsule vending machines,

324
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,345
that I couldn't help but to hand out a candy.

325
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:21,645
And yet I misunderstood the figurine gift,

326
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,045
and the goodwill of the child.

327
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:30,745
Boy, I vow to become a man

328
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:35,545
who's suitable for getting presents from Santa.

329
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:39,245
Please take care of that black-eye.

330
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,945
Pops, here!

331
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:44,145
What?

332
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:45,945
A black-eye figure.

333
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,645
Sir, look closely.

334
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,245
That bird's a white-eye.

335
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:51,345
What?

336
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:52,745
White-eye?

337
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:55,445
No, the color around its eye is black,

338
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,845
so it's a black-eye.

339
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,245
Wrong.

340
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:00,145
It's just that the white paint fell off,

341
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,245
exposing the original black inside.

342
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,845
What?

343
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,245
It's true.

344
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:08,345
The paint merely fell off.

345
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:12,445
I viewed this with impure eyes,

346
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,845
that's why I failed to notice It.

347
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,245
Santa, I'll cherish it.

348
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:21,545
Cherish!

349
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:25,045
I've heard your entire stupid conversation.

350
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,745
You're going to the police.

351
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:29,345
-Then I'll take this black-eye. -You can't!

352
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,145
I'm returning this bird back to its island!

353
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,845
-Shut up! -Stop it!

354
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,545
Back off, brat.

355
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,745
I'm calling the police!

356
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:41,645
Call them if you can.

357
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:43,845
No!

358
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:46,245
Hang up the phone!

359
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,345
Understand, so please release my child!

360
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,845
Until I'm somewhere safe,

361
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:53,945
this brat is going to keep me company.

362
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:56,045
-Santa! -Kurata!

363
00:20:57,245 --> 00:21:00,845
What? Did it malfunction because of the struggle?

364
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,545
Kurata, let go!

365
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,045
Don't move. Don't you move a bit!

366
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,145
Now!

367
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,245
Go!

368
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:54,345
Well, the police said they would consider Yamanaka's circumstances.

369
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:56,945
I see.

370
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:59,845
You've very considerate, Santa.

371
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,845
What's going on, Santa?

372
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,945
Wearing a ribbon like that.

373
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,445
It's a gift from Ran.

374
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:10,045
That fits you perfectly, Haruka.

375
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:11,745
Haruka?

376
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:14,245
Could it be that Santa is a girl?

377
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:15,945
Yes.

378
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:19,245
But I can't believe you figured that out.

379
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,845
It was when she first hugged me.

380
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,845
I've heard that baby girls hug

381
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:28,545
with their whole bodies.

382
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,045
Conan, so you've known that too?

383
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,445
No. I didn't.

384
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,745
Actually, I noticed that while we were in the bathroom.

385
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:40,145
You didn't notice even you were with her all this time?

386
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:42,145
Is that so?

387
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:48,545
Is this funny?

388
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:51,145
All right, come and have fun some other time!

389
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:53,045
And bring your mom.

390
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:54,645
"Bring your mom",

391
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:56,445
I know you'd say that.

392
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,140
"Towel"

394
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,840
The stage for the next episode will be at an Outdoor Spa.

395
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,180
Mixed bath.

396
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,220
Pop.
Mixed bath.

397
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,540
Pop.
