1
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:05,539
Hey. Have you heard of urban legend?

2
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,989
Yes. A rumor that spreads gradually of occurrences

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:13,993
that seem possible, yet impossible.

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,339
I know!

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,739
Like "Kuchisakeonna" (woman with her mouth torn to her ears)

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,439
and "Jinmenken" (a dog with a human face), right?

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,139
Yeah. One of them is...

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,003
The dark tower.

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,739
It's a tower with no entrance or window. A mysterious tower.

10
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:30,339
Yeah! It's standing tall in the Kyodo Garden,

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,639
that pitch black one.

12
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,039
Keep your voice down.

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,339
Kyodo...

14
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:41,639
Come to think of it, she is Nanami Kyodo.

15
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,739
Yeah.

16
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,339
She's Ran's senior in the karate club called Kyodo.

17
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:49,539
They're making stuff like this.

18
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:50,939
A toy company?

19
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,639
A stationary store, right?

20
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,033
No, no.

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,339
This is a place where they make lens, mirrors and optical goods.

22
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:00,039
See.

23
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,639
Don't touch!

24
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,049
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,739
Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,055
I brought it because I thought Conan and the others would like it.

27
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,739
Thank you, Nanami.

28
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,939
It's beautiful!

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,061
Wow!

30
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,339
Let me see it, too!

31
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,065
It's really something!

32
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,339
It changes one after the other!

33
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:28,739
Hurry and change!

34
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,439
-Nanami. -Huh?

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,071
About what you said a while ago,

36
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,639
you seem to be in a tough situation.

37
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:36,739
There are a lot of treasure in the Kyodo residence!

38
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,039
-You thought so, didn't you? -Huh?

39
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,839
Yes... well...

40
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:45,739
Momoe came here too because she thought we were loaded.

41
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,839
It's the name my present mother.

42
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:52,091
Things between my father and her don't look good, though.

43
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:56,095
Did you think that the family of rich people are complex?

44
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,639
Unfortunately, we're running out of money too, though.

45
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:02,839
I sure wish that you at least find the treasure.

46
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,639
Momoe is convinced that there is some.

47
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,139
You mean, treasure?

48
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,139
Where is it?

49
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,239
Did you come to discuss where the treasure is?

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,239
No, she just came to let off steam.

51
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,119
I'm sorry!

52
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,123
That's exactly true, so what can I say?

53
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:26,139
But, I see...

54
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,839
Why not go on a treasure hunt while you're at it, you guys?

55
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,839
Okay!

56
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,139
Hey, Nanami.

57
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,137
If you say something like that and get them excited...

58
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,839
It's worth the try.

59
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:43,239
If by chance they happen to find it,

60
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,639
Mom can use it as alimony to split with Dad.

61
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,139
In other words, I'd be doing my parents a favor.

62
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,139
Oh no...

63
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,339
How about it, people?

64
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,439
Would you like to go on an adventure?

65
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,639
-Aye! -Aye!

66
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,639
The vivid colored memories of summer

67
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,639
solve mysteries all season round.

68
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,739
The dark tower that stands in the suburbs.

69
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,939
What is the secret behind no entrance no windows?

70
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,639
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,639
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,839
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:59,003
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 1)"

74
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,403
It's almost like a park.

75
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:07,603
Is this the whole yard?

76
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:09,803
Just as would be expected of the Kyodo residence.

77
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,291
That, isn't it?

78
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:16,295
Yeah. It's the dark tower.

79
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:22,603
It doesn't have an entrance or any windows.

80
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:25,403
It's said that sometimes a mysterious laughter

81
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,403
is heard from the roof.

82
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:30,603
It's been 40 years already

83
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:32,803
since my grandfather, Seitaro Kyodo built it.

84
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:34,703
He must've been an engineer who liked to take things overboard.

85
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:37,703
I hear that he set up a lot of tricky gadgets in the mansion.

86
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:40,903
The dark tower is one of them, too.

87
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:44,323
Dad is planning to sell the tower, land and all.

88
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,003
You mean the yard and all?

89
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:47,003
Yeah.

90
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:51,003
But, if so, the treasure hunt will go down the drain, right?

91
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,703
So, that's why you mother's getting flustered.

92
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,403
I don't want to!

93
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,503
I'm not selling the place off along with its treasure knowing about it!

94
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:59,903
This is no time to be saying selfish things!

95
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:02,703
This is the last chance we have to rebuild the Kyodo family!

96
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,203
I can't be playing along with your dreams!

97
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:07,003
It's no dream.

98
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:10,349
Tsutomu remembers well, and yet...

99
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,003
It was a bit before grandfather died.

100
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:16,003
I can't be held responsible for such an old story.

101
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:20,359
But you did hear about the treasure, didn't you?

102
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,403
Well, yes, I did hear about it, if you put it that way.

103
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:26,003
See, even Tsutomu's saying so!

104
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:28,903
They've been that way for the longest time.

105
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,603
I'm sorry you had to see something unsightly like that.

106
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:34,103
I'm sure adults have their reasons.

107
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:38,703
Mom's always biting at Dad too, at home.

108
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:41,103
I'm the one being consoled.

109
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:43,403
Okay, why don't we go look at the tower first?

110
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,403
-Aye! -Aye!

111
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:49,503
It's quite tall, isn't it?

112
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,703
How's the roof?

113
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,003
There are no windows,

114
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:55,003
so I'll bet the inside is pitch dark.

115
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:57,903
I wonder why your grandfather made this?

116
00:06:57,903 --> 00:07:00,103
It's the hiding place for the treasure!

117
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,401
It's most natural to think of it that way.

118
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,403
If so, there should be an entrance!

119
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:08,903
-Okay, let's go look for it! -Aye!

120
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:12,003
Haven't you heard about the treasure from you father?

121
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,503
Not at all.

122
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:15,903
Maybe because he was a son-in-law.

123
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,417
Maybe Mom who died heard about it.

124
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,419
And one more person Mr. Nagase may have heard about it.

125
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,703
What kind of person is he?

126
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:26,425
He was an engineer too and grandpa's assistant.

127
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,703
He's living in the annex of our house.

128
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,303
I don't know.

129
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:33,303
Just a hint would do.

130
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,803
Doesn't anything come to mind?

131
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,603
No matter how many times you ask me,

132
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,703
I know nothing of the treasure.

133
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,403
Is that all you want?

134
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:44,443
If so, if you will excuse me.

135
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:46,903
Mr. Nagase!

136
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,803
I'm sure he knows something.

137
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,803
He's not very friendly, but I don't think he would lie.

138
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,103
It's about time you forget about it.

139
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:55,903
If there's no treasure,

140
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,003
I can't get much alimony either, you know.

141
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:02,461
You don't mind me going to court to file our divorce, then, do you?

142
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,803
Momoe, you don't have to go that far.

143
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,103
I'll be going then.

144
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,469
Tsutomu.

145
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,903
Everybody's making fun of me.

146
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:19,303
I heard about the treasure in town.

147
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:20,903
Calm down.

148
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:23,503
There's no need to lend an ear to such rumors.

149
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,003
More than that...

150
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:32,203
Even if there's no entrance in the tower,

151
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:33,703
if you dig a tunnel through here,

152
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:35,403
you can get inside from the main house, can't you?

153
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,403
It would be a large construction.

154
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:39,603
Maybe grandpa would've done it.

155
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,003
For example...

156
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,503
See, the garden light over here?

157
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:47,003
Okay, look at the tower through the arch.

158
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,303
My eyes...

159
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:54,203
I... Something's happening to me.

160
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:55,903
Something's wrong?

161
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,503
A wall of lens is in between.

162
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,803
Good work, boy, exactly!

163
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:02,521
Huh? Since when?

164
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:10,529
This is also a prank that grandpa build.

165
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,503
I wouldn't be surprised

166
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:12,803
if there were an underground passage or something.

167
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,903
Nanami. You've got quite a party there.

168
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,803
Mom. She's my friend in high school, Ms. Ran Mouri.

169
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:22,003
She's my ma, Momoe.

170
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:24,543
I keep telling you to speak more like a girl.

171
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:26,545
Thank you for being my daughter's friend.

172
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,903
I'm sorry we came here in large numbers.

173
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,103
You were talking to big brother, weren't you?

174
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:35,003
Did he recall anything that would be of use?

175
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,903
Something about a blue button,

176
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:40,303
but he doesn't understand what it means.

177
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:41,503
Who are they?

178
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:45,403
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad...

179
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:47,903
They say they'll help look for the treasure.

180
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:50,103
If so, they'll most welcome here, right, Ma?

181
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,903
Yes, yes. I'm counting on you.

182
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:54,303
See you then.

183
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,303
Kids like them can't possibly be of any use.

184
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,303
She doesn't truest us, does she?

185
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:04,003
-No. -What a strong perfume.

186
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:09,203
Besides, she was wearing really long fake nails.

187
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:16,303
How long does this connecting corridor extend?

188
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:19,003
It makes a 90 degree turn right there

189
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,203
and is connected to the storeroom of the annex.

190
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,103
Miso, soy sauce and sake used to be store there,

191
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,103
but now it's just a mere storeroom.

192
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,103
Nagase.

193
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:31,703
What're you doing in the storeroom?

194
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,003
Treasure hunting sounds hard.

195
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,631
And did you find anything?

196
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,403
Yes. I think that if there's any treasure,

197
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,635
it would be in that tower.

198
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,903
A tower without an entrance or any windows

199
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:00,639
is too suspicious!

200
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,643
Absolutely, but there's no way in it, so it can't be helped.

201
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,003
What did they do when they were building it?

202
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:09,903
You can't construct it without a way in or out, can you?

203
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,651
Yeah. That's true, but...

204
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,653
I'm sure we'll find it if we look for it!

205
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,003
So, that's their conclusion.

206
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,003
So, will you please tell them what you know, Tsutomu?

207
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,661
Okay.

208
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,303
When I was seven years old,

209
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:27,303
I had a fever close to 104 degrees Fahrenheit because of a cold.

210
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:30,003
It was when Mom came to see me with Grandpa.

211
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,003
They were talking at my pillow side.

212
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,203
Taeko.

213
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:38,677
I'll tell just you about the story of my treasure.

214
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:42,703
By the time I realized it, they were both gone.

215
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,803
I got anxious and went looking for them.

216
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:57,903
I think I fainted while I was looking for them.

217
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:01,103
When I came to, Mom was taking care of me.

218
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:06,705
Tsutomu. Did you come after us?

219
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:10,203
So, you sniffed the smell of the treasure, eh?

220
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:16,303
Is that all of what you remember?

221
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:19,903
No. There's something new that I recalled.

222
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:23,303
Grandpa pointed to a three-colored button and said...

223
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:26,403
"If you press that button, that's the treasure."

224
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:27,903
What color was the button?

225
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:30,303
The one that Grandpa pointed to was "blue."

226
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,203
Lightning?

227
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:37,003
Hold it. I recall one other thing!

228
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:40,739
When I went after Mom, I disappeared!

229
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,403
That's right. There's no other way to put it.

230
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:46,303
-What do you mean? -Mean?

231
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:48,003
Well, that is...

232
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,103
I don't remember anything else.

233
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,703
But that should've been the entrance to the treasure!

234
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,403
And there's still more.

235
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,103
I was crying while walking along,

236
00:12:57,103 --> 00:13:00,003
then I got big, the minute I got small

237
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:02,303
and then I saw many split images of myself.

238
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,603
Stop!

239
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:07,103
You were just delirious because of you fever!

240
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:10,769
So, the treasure exits.

241
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,203
All we need to do now is to split up and look for it.

242
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,403
Will you help us too, Tsutomu?

243
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,903
Unfortunately, I'm not interested.

244
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:19,603
-What? -What?

245
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:22,781
Getting vegetables ready

246
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,503
is more of an important hobby to me.

247
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,603
It's just like him.

248
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:30,789
The Kyodo Manufacturing Company

249
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,791
will go bankrupt in his generation.

250
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,803
No, it won't!

251
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:37,603
Because we'll find the treasure!

252
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:39,103
Yeah.

253
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:44,303
I'll be looking forward to it, young detectives!

254
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,903
-Yeah! -Yeah!

255
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,803
The tower's getting pretty close.

256
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,809
Huh? I don't see any tower.

257
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,203
No. That's ridiculous.

258
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:57,203
Why? I can see the tower from this window!

259
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,819
I see. This is no ordinary glass.

260
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,503
A 3-D picture is set into it.

261
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,403
Investigation starts!

262
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:10,403
The weather outside is different in every window!

263
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,603
This window is sunny!

264
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,003
This is cloudy.

265
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,203
I wonder which the real weather is?

266
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,103
This is for real!

267
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:22,403
It's Mom's voice!

268
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:27,603
Mom! Mom!

269
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:29,403
Your brother...

270
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,303
Children, stay away!

271
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:35,603
Momoe! Momoe!

272
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,203
Get the ambulance, quick!

273
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,703
I already called for it!

274
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:41,403
What's going on?

275
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,865
It looks like she fell off the tower.

276
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,867
But this tower...

277
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,503
Doesn't have an entrance.

278
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,871
There's no way she could've made it up there!

279
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,941
"Police"

280
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,741
And it was show time for us.

281
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,041
"Children, stay away" he says.

282
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,895
We're unmistakably authorized personnel too and yet!

283
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:22,241
Is it an accident or a case?

284
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:24,903
Mouri, you sure catch on fast.

285
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,641
Well, you see...

286
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,441
I was wondering what we're going to have for dinner.

287
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,841
And when I called Ran and this is what came up.

288
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,841
Did she fall off the tower despite not being able to get in?

289
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,641
No, I don't think so.

290
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:41,341
Maybe the corpse was put on the grass.

291
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,741
We heard her scream, you know.

292
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,341
Maybe it was a recording?

293
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:48,641
What? A recording?

294
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:50,929
A simple trick.

295
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,541
Somebody hit her head in a different place

296
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,741
and carried her body over here.

297
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:56,935
No matter who sees this,

298
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,441
they would think she fell off the tower.

299
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:03,441
But this dark tower has no entrance.

300
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:07,241
In other words, the culprit would be would be narrowed down

301
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:09,541
to somebody that didn't know that there is no entrance.

302
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,441
It's a beginner's concept as far as mysteries are concerned.

303
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,041
All the members of the Kyodo family know

304
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,641
that they cannot enter the tower, but...

305
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,141
Of course then the one who becomes suspicious

306
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,961
is somebody who's come here for the first time!

307
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,041
For example...

308
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,241
For example... Me?

309
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:28,741
Of course not!

310
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:31,341
But like Officer Takagi says,

311
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,741
the rumor's going around town too

312
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:37,641
that there is treasure in the tower but it can't be entered!

313
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:40,441
-Right, that's it! -What?

314
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:41,941
The culprit carried the corpse over

315
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:44,441
to make it look like she fell off the tower.

316
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:47,541
If so, the police will thoroughly check the tower!

317
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,341
As a result, the treasure will be found!

318
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:53,941
I see. Is that the reason the corpse was moved?

319
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:55,441
Which means that the culprit is...

320
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:57,741
In other words, everyone in this Kyodo family

321
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,241
is to be suspected.

322
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,241
So we're back to scratch.

323
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,441
My God!

324
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,003
Inspector!

325
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,741
So the company as well as the family has problems.

326
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:15,013
And everyone is capable of committing the crime.

327
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,341
Everyone except for that young lady.

328
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:21,641
Only since the Father and the Son is not for the treasure,

329
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,023
so you deduction doesn't have grounds.

330
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,941
But there is one person who was sure that there would be treasure.

331
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,341
Right?

332
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,941
I'm sure that, that person is the culprit!

333
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:35,541
Unfortunately, it's the victim.

334
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:39,441
Conan, what do you think?

335
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,741
Do you think she died of an accident?

336
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,841
I'm sure we've got a case!

337
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:47,045
Unfortunately, we can't be sure yet.

338
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,641
We met her in the yard.

339
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,641
There wasn't enough time to move the body.

340
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,441
True.

341
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:58,241
It's most natural to thin that she fell off the tower.

342
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,441
Which means that the victim found the entrance

343
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:04,341
right after she met us?

344
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,041
Maybe it's this way.

345
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,641
She was lured into the tower

346
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,441
by the culprit who was knowledgeable about it,

347
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,069
and was pushed off!

348
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:16,441
Maybe the culprit is still hiding in the tower.

349
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:19,741
But we've got to find the entrance.

350
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,079
Exactly.

351
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,741
Even if we find the entrance,

352
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:24,241
we don't need to go inside.

353
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:28,241
The lady was walking near the garden light, wasn't she?

354
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,089
If there was an entrance, it has to be in this direction.

355
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,741
Do you have any clue?

356
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,641
The old man called Seitaro was an engineer.

357
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,141
I think he hid it with things

358
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,841
like the glass and lens that we just saw.

359
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:42,341
-Huh? -What's the matter?

360
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,103
This looks suspicious!

361
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,641
I disappeared... or so I thought...

362
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,041
This trace...

363
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,941
Is it a door?

364
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:54,441
I found it! The secret entrance!

365
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,141
All right.

366
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,541
Looks impossible, it's rusty.

367
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,123
If she went in,

368
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,125
she would've gone through a plain normal entrance.

369
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,127
-I guess so. -Right.

370
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,129
Let's try somewhere else.

371
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:14,341
Become a giant, become a dwarf.

372
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,541
Many splits of myself.

373
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,641
Disappear...

374
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,441
How beautiful!

375
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:26,041
Amazing!

376
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,741
The entire floor is like a planetarium!

377
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,641
Who knows what will happen.

378
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,741
Stay together, okay?

379
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:36,341
Hey, Ayumi!

380
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,041
You shouldn't go off alone.

381
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,241
But...

382
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:41,941
-Let's go together. -Yep.

383
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,041
Ai, too?

384
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,541
This is the ladies room.

385
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,941
I see.

386
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,541
I'll catch up with you right away, so go on ahead.

387
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,141
Yep.

388
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,741
Disappear?

389
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,181
It can't be.

390
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,441
Wind?

391
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:07,541
Maybe...

392
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:17,195
Ai, are you still in there?

393
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,197
Ai's gone!

394
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,341
What?

395
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,841
Hey, Ai!

396
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:26,241
-Ai! -Ai!

397
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,207
There's wind coming from the space.

398
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:33,211
Ai!

399
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:37,641
Gosh. There's got be an entrance elsewhere!

400
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,041
Next door is the liquor storeroom.

401
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,241
Okay, let's search there!

402
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,941
It smells of liquor!

403
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,741
I'm used it because of Dad!

404
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,541
There's a mirror!

405
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,241
Why would it be left standing in a place like this?

406
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,441
Standing it there is just sham.

407
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,441
It's on very tightly.

408
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,237
This is probably the entrance that she went through.

409
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:03,641
I disappeared. There's no other way to put it.

410
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,841
How would he disappear?

411
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:08,441
There's a mirror here, too.

412
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,741
This smell...

413
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:13,251
If you sniff it too much, you'll really get drunk.

414
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,541
No, I smell the lady's perfume.

415
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,641
Her smell is all over this area.

416
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:22,641
What's up?

417
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,141
Disappeared!

418
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:27,265
The ceiling is reflected in the mirror but we're not?

419
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:30,941
It switched to a screen!

420
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,741
A picture's being taken from there!

421
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,041
Rubber tape?

422
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,541
A person can go under it!

423
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,741
It's the entrance to the treasure! Let's go!

424
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,041
We'll be in trouble if the culprit is there!

425
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:45,741
Hey!

426
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,285
What shall we do?

427
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,141
What shall we do, Conan?

428
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,299
Ai?

429
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,541
Ai!

430
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,741
It's not like her to scream like that.

431
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,041
I'll be right over!

432
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,041
Stay here, Ayumi!

433
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,309
-No. I'm going to rescue her! -Don't!

434
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:19,841
Okay, let's go!

435
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:21,741
Don't ever let go of my hand.

436
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,641
Okay!

437
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,784
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:06,160
"Circle and Triangle"

439
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,472
-First of all, the treasure! -No.

440
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:09,188
What? Why?

441
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:10,760
Because there was a strange person there.
