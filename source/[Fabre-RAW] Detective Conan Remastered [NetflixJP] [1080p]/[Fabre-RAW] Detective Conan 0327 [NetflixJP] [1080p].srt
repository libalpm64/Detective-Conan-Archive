1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,440
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,940
The fragrance of murder

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,140
and the blotches of a love affair.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,260
The Morozumi residence

9
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,560
that Hattori, Pops and I went on behalf of Kusukawa,

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
to investigate caught fire,

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
and Ryoko Morozumi dies.

12
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,860
Like all the other serial arson sites,

13
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,160
a red horse doll is left behind at the site.

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,160
However, one of the suspects Takanori Genda, admits to the crime,

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,760
and the case seems to have closed, but...

16
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,960
"Red Horse In The Fire (Case Solved)"

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,760
Oh, no! It's already 3 pm.

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,360
I guess we'll just have to forget about Tropical Land.

19
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,860
I see.

20
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,260
It's true that if we do as you say,

21
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,260
fire could be ignited automatically.

22
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,460
But the burn on that light bulb

23
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,760
could be something that coincidentally got there during the fire.

24
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,760
If that trick were to be used,

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,760
any of the three could've done it, couldn't they?

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,660
The owner of that house, Akira Morozumi, of course.

27
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,260
That womanizer Misao Soga,

28
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,160
as well as Ryoko's older sister, Keiko Gondo

29
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,860
seem to have frequently gone in and out of the house.

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,160
We came to Mr. Genda's house to find out who the culprit is,

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,860
so let's hurry and go into the house.

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,260
Yeah, right.

33
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,760
We may find a diary or something that could be a key to the case.

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,160
Gosh.

35
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,060
But you don't even have a search warrant

36
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,660
and yet you have the keys. It's amazing.

37
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,460
I told Genda that I would prove his innocence.

38
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,660
Then he broke out in tears and lent it to me.

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,360
It sure is a big house for Mr. Genda to be living in alone.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,460
Yeah.

41
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,860
He was living here with his mother after his father passed away,

42
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,960
but last year, his mother also passed away of an illness.

43
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,960
By the way, Mouri, did you notice

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,860
the shoe marks in the corridor?

45
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,360
Yes. They're here and there.

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,760
The shoe marks of someone...

47
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,760
These are Mr. Genda's shoe marks.

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,660
It's the same as the shoes that's in the shoes cabinet.

49
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,760
Which means that Mr. Genda...

50
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,460
Hey. Take a look at this.

51
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,060
There's something strange in the wastebasket.

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,060
A soiled pair of socks and a burnt shirt.

53
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,760
If Mr. Genda's sleepwalking habit was getting worse,

54
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,060
maybe his saying, "The other me did it",

55
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,560
is not all that much of a lie.

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
He's not that kind of a guy.

57
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,260
He's not the kind of man

58
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,760
that would set fire to other people's houses.

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,760
Mr. Yuminaga...

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Hey, Kudo!

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Come here a minute!

62
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,660
It's the telephone bill that was on top of the shoes cabinet.

63
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,060
It says 30,000 yen a month.

64
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,860
Isn't it a bit too much?

65
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,860
It's true that it's strange for a guy who's living alone, but...

66
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,360
Ran also talks to Sonoko for a long time over silly things

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,260
and the bill totals to about that much.

68
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,860
Come to think of it,

69
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,160
silly Kazuha does the same thing.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,760
She talks for a long time with my mom.

71
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,260
I wonder why women like to talk on the phone so much.

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,460
Well, I'm so sorry!

73
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,760
That our phone calls are so silly!

74
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Heiji!

75
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,360
Conan!

76
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,160
Don't tell me you guys were eavesdropping from the front door?

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,460
We wouldn't do something low class like that!

78
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,560
You idiot!

79
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
We were listening to the car radio

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,060
when we heard you guys talking.

81
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,860
Right?

82
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,060
Radio?

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,160
It's inside this vase.

84
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,760
Here it is! Look!

85
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,260
It's a wiretap.

86
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,860
Huh?

87
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,760
That's exactly the same as the vase

88
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,660
that is in the front entrance of the Morozumi's, isn't it?

89
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,960
We heard other things, too.

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,760
Something about the wastebasket.

91
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,660
Hey, wait!

92
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,460
There's got be one near this wastebasket too, a wiretap.

93
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
A crystal ball?

94
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,160
Hattori.

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,860
I found it.

96
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,660
This time inside the cushion under the crystal ball.

97
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,060
I've seen that!

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,460
It's the crystal of good luck that the woman fortune-teller

99
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,360
at the building in front of Haido Station is selling.

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,760
She's known for being pretty good.

101
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,460
Hey! That small cushion...

102
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,560
It's a different color,

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,460
but similar to the one Ryoko was holding, don't you think?

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,060
Don't tell me...

105
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,460
Could it be in here, too?

106
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
Hey.

107
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,760
No.

108
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,860
It's not a wiretap.

109
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,360
But we found something unbelievable.

110
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,060
Yes. The guy, Genda confessed,

111
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,960
but suddenly refused to say anything.

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,160
The red horse was indeed handmade by Genda.

113
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,160
But he refuses to say anything about the serial arsons.

114
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
And we're at Genda's house right now,

115
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,760
but can't find any vital evidence.

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,860
Genda saying that he has a habit of sleepwalking

117
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,260
is probably a lie, too.

118
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,060
Well, the forensic officers will be here tomorrow,

119
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
so I'm sure something will come out.

120
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,360
When something more concerning the investigations come up,

121
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,760
I'll contact you again.

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,860
Was it okay, sonny?

123
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,760
Just great, Inspector!

124
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,260
But, what are you up to anyway?

125
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,460
Making fake calls like that to all three suspects?

126
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Fake calls?

127
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,960
They're fake calls, aren't they?

128
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,860
You found wiretaps in the vase at the front entrance

129
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,760
as well as something in the cushion.

130
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,060
There is proof everywhere

131
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,960
that Mr. Genda had a habit of sleepwalking.

132
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,360
Well, I'll explain everything later.

133
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,160
And us being here, too.

134
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,860
Won't that make more work for the forensic officers?

135
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah. I'm sure our hair is on the floor somewhere, too.

136
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Then, what should we do to erase all evidence that we were here?

137
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,460
What should we do?

138
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,360
Go all out and clean the place, what else?

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,660
If you didn't have time to do so, then what?

140
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,360
Well...

141
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,360
Maybe...

142
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
Hey.

143
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,260
Aren't you forgetting to leave this red horse behind?

144
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Mr. Arsonist.

145
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,240
Or, should I say...

146
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,240
Mr. Morozumi.

147
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,640
Yeah.

148
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,540
This key holder of the red horse that Mr. Genda made

149
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
was the start of everything.

150
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,740
This red horse that is supposed to bring prosperous business.

151
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,740
I don't know what caused the first fire in Rizencho,

152
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,440
but this horse was found at the site of the fire

153
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,340
because the owner of the house was a good customer of Mr. Genda's store.

154
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,440
Mr. Genda probably gave that person this key holder inside a box.

155
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,540
But before the person opened the box, the house caught fire.

156
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,240
The box and Guan Yu both burned

157
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,640
leaving behind only the Red Rabbit Horse.

158
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,940
Of course, the owner of the house

159
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
would have no knowledge of the horse.

160
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,240
And "Red Horse" is a code word for the police meaning arsonist.

161
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
So, the press began making a fuss writing articles

162
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,940
such as "The Start of a Series of Arsons".

163
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940
On the other hand, Mr. Genda who was shocked at hearing the person saying,

164
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,540
she knew nothing about the horse that he gave her...

165
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,240
got worried that maybe his sleepwalking habit

166
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
when he was a child had reoccurred again,

167
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,440
and went to your hospital,

168
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,540
where he was taken advantage of.

169
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,240
And when you heard Genda's story, you made him believe that

170
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,140
he was a sleepwalker who had a habit of committing arsons,

171
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,640
and took note of the fact that the first fire occurred in 1-chome.

172
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,240
Then after, you set fire to 2-chome and 3-chome in order.

173
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,840
You burned your house on 4-chome,

174
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
and killed your wife, Ryoko.

175
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,740
You cut the Guan Yu and stand off the key holder

176
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,840
and left the red horse at the site of the fire

177
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,140
to make it look like the serial arsonist did it,

178
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,740
and framed Mr. Genda up as the arsonist.

179
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,440
You made a spare key for this house

180
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,540
and snuck in here night after night

181
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,140
to corner Mr. Genda up against the wall.

182
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,840
You left shoe prints,

183
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,940
burnt shirts and dirty socks in his room

184
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,940
to make him come under the illusion that he was the arsonist.

185
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,140
But Mr. Genda came of his own initiative to my hospital

186
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,640
saying that he had a habit of sleepwalking.

187
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,540
But that's when he was a child, right?

188
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,140
I saw on TV that there are many cases

189
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,540
when a nervous child unable to cope with all the excitement

190
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,940
during the day sleepwalks around his sleeping quarters at night.

191
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,240
A psychiatrist should know something like that

192
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,440
right off the bat, no?

193
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
But Mr. Genda was loitering around nearby

194
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,040
when my house caught fire, wasn't he?

195
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,140
I would never know something like that,

196
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,740
even if I were his doctor, would I?

197
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,740
You heard Genda and Soga talking on the phone, didn't you?

198
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,240
With the wiretap that you set up inside the underside of the telephone

199
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,940
that you took out a while ago.

200
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,140
After hearing Soga say, "If you go to the houses on that day,

201
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,840
your fortune will take a turn for the better."

202
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,740
You picked the date to set fire.

203
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,740
All you had to do was change the beckoning cat key holder Genda

204
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,940
was supposed to pass out to the neighborhood that day,

205
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,340
to the Red Rabbit Horse.

206
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,940
You knew that Mr. Genda would come to retrieve the key holders

207
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,540
when he finds out that he had passed out the wrong ones and that,

208
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,140
the people would become suspicious at seeing him do this.

209
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,240
Since it was the day that Ryoko had called the detective,

210
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,340
you figured that if things worked out well,

211
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,440
the detective would remember Genda.

212
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,840
Please wait!

213
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,840
The fire was set at past 7:30 pm, right?

214
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I went out to drink with Mr. Soga before 7:30 pm,

215
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,840
and he also testified to this.

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,440
Or, are you saying that the boy next door

217
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,340
who testified to the time of the arson is lying?

218
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,540
Huh? What's this?

219
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,340
The tissue paper is wrapped around the light bulb and taped on.

220
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,740
And there's something poked in between the tissue paper, too.

221
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,040
Wait!

222
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It's a match!

223
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,540
The surface temperature of a light bulb of 100 watts

224
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,240
is 218 degrees.

225
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,640
Wrapping tissue paper around something like that

226
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,140
and moreover, poking a match between it.

227
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,340
It's not hard to figure out what will happen, is it?

228
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,240
In other words, it's a time-igniting device

229
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,140
to set fire to your house

230
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,940
while you are out drinking with Mr. Soga.

231
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,640
You did the same thing to the light bulb in the storeroom,

232
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,240
poured kerosene on the floor

233
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,040
and stuck a red horse between the window beforehand.

234
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,340
Then, before you went out drinking with Mr. Soga,

235
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,540
you turned on the light.

236
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,040
So, 10 minutes later, the match would ignite,

237
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,540
the tissue paper would fall to the ground and fire would break out.

238
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,040
Then, the boy next door

239
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,440
as usual watches TV with the room dark.

240
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,740
When the tissue is wrapped around the light bulb,

241
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,340
the light is still weak,

242
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,540
so the silhouette of the horse will not project.

243
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,640
But after the tissue paper burns off,

244
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
the silhouette of the horse is projected

245
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,140
as if the arsonist had left the horse behind at that time.

246
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,940
Next, you were probably planning to sneak in here

247
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,140
and burn this place down to erase traces of you having been here.

248
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,640
But there is still other evidence.

249
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,340
It's the stand of the key holder

250
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,840
with the words "Red Rabbit Horse" on it

251
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
that Ryoko was holding on to at the time she died.

252
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,940
The cut part matched the leg of the horse

253
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,140
that was left back at the fire site on 3-chome.

254
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,540
Now, all that needs to be done is to see

255
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,240
if the fingerprints that are on it match your fingerprints.

256
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
You cut off the stand and Guan Yu

257
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,440
because you didn't want anyone to know it was what Mr. Genda had made.

258
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,340
You didn't want him to get caught before you kill Ryoko.

259
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,440
It seems she knew what you were up to though.

260
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,540
She probably asked the detective to come and investigate

261
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,440
the suspicious person loitering around at night,

262
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
but found out that it was you,

263
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,440
experimenting on the trick in the storeroom.

264
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,040
After realizing it was you,

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
she checked your belongings

266
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,940
and found the red horse and the stand,

267
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,740
and was convinced that the serial arsonist was you.

268
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,040
She probably asked us to leave

269
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,340
because she was planning to threaten you to...

270
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,840
Right!

271
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
She threatened to divorce me and kick me out of this house!

272
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,140
All I wanted to do was

273
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,140
burn the house and build a hospital.

274
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,440
Hey, hey.

275
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,540
Only if this stand wasn't found!

276
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,440
If I didn't get deceived into a trap like this!

277
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,140
This was supposed to be a perfect crime!

278
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,140
You idiot. We knew from before you came here.

279
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't lie!

280
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,740
Soga could've done it, and so could Ryoko's older sister!

281
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,840
Yeah.

282
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,140
Those two also sold objects with wiretaps in them to Genda

283
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,040
and were wiretapping him.

284
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,840
They probably wanted him to believe in Feng Shui

285
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,040
and fortune-telling by telling him stuff only he alone knew,

286
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,440
and sell him more expensive stuff.

287
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,540
We found out from the telephone bill that the phone was wiretapped.

288
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,940
When you wiretap using the telephone line,

289
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,540
it has to be connected all the while

290
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
so the telephone bill sky-rockets.

291
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,040
So, how can you tell that I'm the one who set it up?

292
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,040
It could be either one of the two!

293
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,740
You still don't realize?

294
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,340
Huh?

295
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,940
You understand that in order to set up a wiretap in the phone,

296
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,140
you have to sneak into the house, right?

297
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,540
Yeah.

298
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,140
As for the other two, if they were to sneak into the house,

299
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,840
they would first of all remove the wiretap

300
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,140
from the things that they sold Mr. Genda,

301
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,140
because otherwise, they'd be suspected.

302
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,940
You probably came across committing this crime

303
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,140
after reading Agatha Christie's "The ABC Murders",

304
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,040
but why didn't you realize then

305
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,240
that no matter how hard you think out the plan,

306
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,140
the one who gets to laugh at the end is not the killer,

307
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,740
but the old man with the gray brain.

308
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,140
See you then, Mouri. Thanks for everything.

309
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,240
No, not at all.

310
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
No. Rather...

311
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,840
maybe I should be thanking these boys?

312
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,040
By the way, what will become of those two?

313
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,940
Well, it's not that they sold

314
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,840
something outrageously expensive to Genda yet,

315
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,440
and all they did was sneak in to collect their wiretaps

316
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,040
because they didn't want to be suspected as arsonists, so...

317
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,440
We'll let them go after we give them a good lecture at the station.

318
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,540
Tell me. Why did you believe Genda was innocent?

319
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,840
Yeah.

320
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,740
When Genda came up as a suspect,

321
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,540
I called him out to the park and talked to him.

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
I stayed with him for 30 minutes, but he hardly talked.

323
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
So, we decided to talk again some other time

324
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,640
and I got up from the bench.

325
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,740
I turned to look back at him from a distance,

326
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,740
and saw him looking desperately for something

327
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,940
in the grassy area around the bench.

328
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,440
It began raining a little while after he left the bench.

329
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,740
After seeing the look of relief on his face,

330
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,240
I finally understood

331
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,140
that he was looking for the cigarette butt

332
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,440
that I threw down on the ground.

333
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,340
Because that was what caused the fire that took his father's life.

334
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,940
I just couldn't believe that a guy like him

335
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,640
could set fire to anybody's house.

336
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,840
Neither did I want believe he could.

337
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,740
It's as simple as that.

338
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
See you, Mouri!

339
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,040
Yes, sir!

340
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,140
Hey, come on. A little cheaper!

341
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,940
I came all the way here to buy from you to cheer you up, you know?

342
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,940
But that watch is made by a famous craftsman.

343
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,740
No matter how famous,

344
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
if it doesn't move unless you wind it,

345
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,540
it's practically useless in this day and age, right?

346
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,140
But...

347
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,240
Okay! Give me this too and a 500 yen discount.

348
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,540
How's about it?

349
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,140
Heiji, we better hurry

350
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,240
or we won't make it in time for the plane going back home.

351
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,740
Come on, mister. Hurry and wrap it up, will you?

352
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,940
Simple wrapping will do.

353
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,340
-Yes. Thank you very much! -Hey, Kazuha!

354
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,340
Never mind giving him a discount already,

355
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,940
so can you give me this antique jewelry for free?

356
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,840
What?

357
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,140
Okay, mister?

358
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,240
No, no way!

359
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,640
Are you guys really trying to cheer him up or what?

360
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Please, mister!

361
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,020
Next Conan's Hint:

362
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,940
"Wine glass"

363
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
Is the next story about Japanese sake again?

364
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,220
Isn't it about Dad's hobby?

365
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,940
-Even the staff cannot be trusted. -Yes.
