1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:05,761
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:09,461
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:12,661
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,561
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,261
Everyone who gathers in the dining room

6
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:20,661
after receiving text mail from the owner of the mansion,

7
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:23,361
witness the eerie image of the owner outside the window,

8
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,361
and a monster flying through the sky.

9
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:29,461
After that, the second son is found dead.

10
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,261
Aim for a 100% solution.

11
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,761
Clear all mysteries and codes.

12
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,661
Danger closes in on Ran and Kazuha!

13
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,761
Solve the mystery to haunting phenomenon!

14
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:43,361
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,261
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:48,027
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:34,133
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Three)"

18
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,558
This is bad, Kudo.

19
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,558
Yeah, if this murder was committed by Hikaru,

20
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:42,658
her motive is probably

21
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,758
to take revenge on the person who killed her mother,

22
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,145
making it look like an accident!

23
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,658
And the one who schemed this,

24
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,558
were Asanobu who was just found dead

25
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:53,558
and Ms. Shimizu the maid who died six months ago.

26
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:56,758
And if Kamiyo who hasn't been seen for a while,

27
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,858
also took part in it...

28
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,858
She's probably already been killed and her body's

29
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:04,658
already in that locked freezer!

30
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:09,358
Kazuha and Ran are about to open it just now.

31
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,258
Ran and Kazuha are in trouble!

32
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,958
Oh, it opened. It opened, Ran!

33
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,258
You did it!

34
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:21,158
What a loud thunder burst.

35
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,458
Yep. It's kind of scary.

36
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,458
But we cooked a lot of pot sticks!

37
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,558
That's right, exactly!

38
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:29,458
We'll overcome this with garlic power!

39
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,458
-Darn! -Just as I thought!

40
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:37,458
-Kazuha! -Are you all right? Ran?

41
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,658
Hikaru...

42
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,058
Hey, you!

43
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:48,758
Pot sticks?

44
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:49,858
"Hikaru Hinohara (24), Torakura Family Maid"

45
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:52,211
Oh, I was hungry,

46
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,215
so when I smelled the pot sticks, I just couldn't help myself.

47
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,558
I'm sorry! For eating without permission.

48
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:01,758
But, it was really delicious!

49
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:05,458
Thank you...

50
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,758
And? Did you look inside the freezer?

51
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:08,858
Yep.

52
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:11,358
Something strange was inside.

53
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:12,858
Huh?

54
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,235
See, a large can of laver.

55
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:21,558
My mom always also puts laver in the freezer so it doesn't go stale.

56
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,358
But, usually not the entire can.

57
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:24,558
True.

58
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:26,558
Wasn't there anything else inside?

59
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,958
Nope. It's such a large freezer and yet...

60
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,258
To think that all that was in here was this can.

61
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,255
Then, what was that anyway?

62
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,458
The trace of something being dragged along

63
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,261
that was found on the floor.

64
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,263
How about up there?

65
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,558
The one on top is also a freezer and it wasn't locked.

66
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,058
But it was packed fully with food.

67
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:54,273
Are you the only person who had the key to this freezer, Hikaru?

68
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,958
I think Hakuya has it too...

69
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,558
Which means that he entrusted you

70
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:01,158
with all the keys to this mansion?

71
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,258
No. The only keys I have

72
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:06,958
are the ones for this kitchen and the rooms nearby.

73
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:11,058
The other maids and the butler have the rest of the keys.

74
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:15,658
-Is everyone still up, right? -Yes.

75
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:17,758
If so, will you please tell them to come to the kitchen?

76
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,858
So, we can serve them pot sticks for a late-night snack.

77
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:23,458
But, after such an incident,

78
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,758
I wonder if they'll be up to eating?

79
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,307
I was starved, though.

80
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
After such an incident?

81
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,458
Do you want to know about it?

82
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,458
No, I don't want to hear about it, no!

83
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,858
Well, don't worry.

84
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:39,958
Half the haunted phenomenon that occurred here today's been solved.

85
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:44,658
I'll bet everyone will regain his appetite after hearing so.

86
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,331
Hey. I hope you're serious?

87
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,333
About the problem having been solved.

88
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,335
Yeah, most of it.

89
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,958
Mystery? It's obvious who the culprit is.

90
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,658
It's Hakuya, isn't it? The one who killed my husband?

91
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:06,858
Don't tell me you figured out the cause of why Hakuya

92
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,058
turned into a vampire?

93
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:10,758
Well, since too many strange things have been happening,

94
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:13,458
I can understand that you can't help feeling that way but...

95
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,353
-"Rikushige Koga (71), Butler" -I wonder if such a thing

96
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,758
as vampires really do exist?

97
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:18,758
Well, you can decide for yourself as to that

98
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,358
after you watch this trick and tell me what you think.

99
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:22,758
This room is...

100
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,658
Are you also referring to the time

101
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,958
when Hakuya vanished from inside that coffin?

102
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,558
Yeah. At first, there was nothing visibly done

103
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:35,258
to the tile under the coffin so it was a mystery, but...

104
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:37,458
The position of where the coffin was placed was different to begin with!

105
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,658
-Huh? -The position was different?

106
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,258
See.

107
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:43,958
The carpet is slit

108
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,958
so that when you pull on it, this part can be pulled off.

109
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,158
And, if you pull the part of the carpet that has been pulled off...

110
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:55,558
The entrance of the hidden corridor appears.

111
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:57,858
A hidden corridor?

112
00:06:57,858 --> 00:07:00,399
The entrance door is a sliding door

113
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,858
and the hidden corridor is connected to the 1st floor storeroom.

114
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:07,058
But, there are no stair in the storeroom!

115
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:09,058
You just didn't realize there

116
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,958
since it was camouflaged by the hidden door

117
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,411
that moves shelf and all.

118
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:15,358
Come to think of it, after that trip,

119
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:19,658
I felt like the storeroom sort of seemed a bit more cluttered.

120
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:20,858
A trip?

121
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,258
Yes. About six months ago,

122
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:26,158
just before the incident of Ms. Shimizu occurred,

123
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:30,058
the owner told everyone in the mansion to take a break

124
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,458
so we all went abroad for about a week.

125
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:37,058
Which means, this hidden corridor was built during that week.

126
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,458
Hey, hold it.

127
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,058
I understand the corridor,

128
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,441
but how did Hakuya come out of the coffin?

129
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:43,958
That's simple.

130
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,758
There's a sliding door at the bottom of the coffin too.

131
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,451
And besides, on the place of the lid that matches,

132
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,158
there is a strong magnet embedded

133
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,457
and it seems that once you close it, the lid locks.

134
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,858
Until you undo it, using this remote controller

135
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,258
that was here in the storeroom.

136
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:05,758
In other words...

137
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:08,958
If you use this trick,

138
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:14,473
you can go in and out of the coffin at will.

139
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:16,475
Of course, it's possible to go out

140
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:19,258
and murder the maid Ms. Shimizu too.

141
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,058
Which means Ms. Shimizu was killed by Hakuya?

142
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:24,858
Yeah, probably so.

143
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,485
The gate guard of this mansion

144
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,058
seems to have positioned there,

145
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:29,858
after the incident of Ms. Shimizu occurred.

146
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:33,058
If he could somehow lure Ms. Shimizu to come to the site,

147
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,458
it would be easy for him to go out to kill her,

148
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,758
still pretending to be asleep in the coffin.

149
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:41,258
And? Where's Hakuya now?

150
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,501
Beats me.

151
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:46,505
He may be hiding somewhere, ambushing his next prey.

152
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:47,958
Oh, no.

153
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,158
But, if we all stay together we'll be fine,

154
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,558
because he's no monster.

155
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,458
Because a vampire who can go through walls

156
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,158
and fly through the sky

157
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:00,519
wouldn't have to use hidden corridor, would he?

158
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:06,525
Wow, what a downpour!

159
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
What bum weather for sure.

160
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:12,531
Right. Everyone's late, don't you think?

161
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,533
And, we've cooked so many pot sticks.

162
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:17,658
By the way, Ran. I wonder what's up?

163
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,858
The thing that Hikaru mentioned a while ago.

164
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:23,958
I wonder but I'd rather not think about it.

165
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,545
If by chance, if the owner of this mansion that we saw

166
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
is really a vampire,

167
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:31,058
maybe Heiji and Conan's been bitten,

168
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:33,358
and transformed one after the other into vampires...

169
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:38,557
No way! You mean we're the only humans in this mansion?

170
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:40,558
It can't be.

171
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:42,058
No, it can't.

172
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,958
No good. After all this ridiculous talk,

173
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,858
I'm starting to get hungry.

174
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,758
Then, shall we take a bite?

175
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,569
We can just cook more after everyone gets here!

176
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
Which means that the psychic picture

177
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,058
we took in this room is also a trick?

178
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,958
Yep! Will you all get into the same position that you were in

179
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,858
when the picture was being taken?

180
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,258
Okay.

181
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,658
Come on, smile everybody!

182
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:08,258
Heiji relax more too!

183
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,589
-Huh? -Heiji?

184
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,858
What're you talking about?

185
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,593
There are only five of us here in this room including you.

186
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,595
There is another person behind you!

187
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,158
What's going on?

188
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,601
Isn't this a mirror?

189
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,358
It's a magic mirror!

190
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,958
If one side of it is dark, it looks like a mirror.

191
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,058
But if you light up the dark side, it becomes like glass!

192
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:34,158
It's easy to see right through the trick.

193
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:36,615
All you have to do is stick your finger on to it.

194
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:37,858
Finger?

195
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,858
With a normal mirror, there'll be a gap

196
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:41,858
between your finger and its reflection,

197
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:47,558
since a reflective coating is applied to the glass's back surface.

198
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:49,458
But in a magic mirror, the reflective surface

199
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,958
is on the front surface of the glass,

200
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,631
the real image and the image in the mirror

201
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,058
look as if they are stuck together!

202
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:58,158
Well, when we lit the light from this side,

203
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,639
we could see all the clothes that were hanging!

204
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,641
All the clothes hanging?

205
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,158
I get it!

206
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:07,158
The closet of the next room!

207
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:09,558
Exactly!

208
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,958
There's a sliding door on the closet's back wall.

209
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,058
If opened, the magic mirror will appear at the spot

210
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,658
where the mirror frame of the next room is.

211
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,058
All that needs to be done after this is,

212
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:22,661
just before taking the picture, the person in the closet

213
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,258
shines light on his own face.

214
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,858
Then a psychic picture of that person's blurry face

215
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:31,158
emerging in the mirror is completed.

216
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,158
So, now you know.

217
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:36,058
The culprit desperately used the trick

218
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,677
to make himself look like a monster.

219
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,258
It means that he's merely human!

220
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:44,258
So is the culprit Hakuya after all?

221
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:47,458
Yeah! There's no doubt, he's one of the culprits!

222
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,158
One of the culprits?

223
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,958
Does he have an accomplice?

224
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,858
Hakuya's got a serious illness, doesn't he?

225
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:55,458
He wouldn't be able to move around

226
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,697
without getting help from someone else, would he?

227
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:02,358
And for now, the prime suspect of being an accomplice

228
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:05,758
is the oldest daughter who has been gone for several hours now.

229
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:09,358
I just got word from the gate guard

230
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:10,709
that a person was found dead in the forest

231
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,258
in front of the mansion.

232
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:14,713
What?

233
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,158
It's the oldest daughter, Kamiyo!

234
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:25,958
She's tied to a pole...

235
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:26,725
Strangulation.

236
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,258
You're guards, aren't you?

237
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:33,458
Haven't you seen who left to go out with her?

238
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,458
No. The thing is after the man called Otaki

239
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,158
and the man with a mustache drove away in the car,

240
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,158
no one left out the gate.

241
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:45,558
That can't be! Then, how did she go out of the gate?

242
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,758
Are you telling me she flew through the sky or what?

243
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,753
Really?

244
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,871
You really didn't open the gate of the mansion

245
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,971
since Mr. Otaki left with his car?

246
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:01,471
Oh, well...

247
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,371
We did open the gate once.

248
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,071
Because the furniture company truck came.

249
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:08,271
The owner had ordered the chairs

250
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:11,771
he wanted to buy newly from several days ago

251
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,071
but when we checked the package, they mistakenly

252
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:16,271
had brought a sofa.

253
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:19,471
So, we told them to take it back with them for today,

254
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:21,671
and that's when there was that explosion.

255
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,571
You mean of the tunnel collapsing?

256
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,371
Yeah. I watched for a while.

257
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:30,371
If the culprit used that split moment,

258
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,871
it may have been possible to go out the gate without being noticed.

259
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:36,271
But after tying the corpse to the pole,

260
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,571
whoever went out would be noticed when coming back.

261
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:42,801
Besides, why did the culprit stop part way?

262
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,371
Part way?

263
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:47,771
Look! There's a hole near the corpse.

264
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,809
I think the culprit was planning to stand her corpse.

265
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:52,071
True.

266
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:56,815
If it's the same culprit who killed Ms. Shimizu six months ago,

267
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,271
the culprit might've done it to drain her blood.

268
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:02,071
The strange bruise on the right upper arm

269
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:05,371
of the corpse bothers me too.

270
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,825
The thing that bothers me most though

271
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:10,829
is that the fingertips of both her hands are wounded badly.

272
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:14,171
True. It doesn't look like something that was incurred

273
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,471
when she tried to fight the culprit off either.

274
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:22,571
Kamiyo...

275
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,771
Was found killed in the forest?

276
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,871
Was it really Honey?

277
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:29,171
Yeah.

278
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,851
Oh, no. Why?

279
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,671
More than that, who's the culprit?

280
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,471
The gate guards should've witnessed somebody, right?

281
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:40,171
They say that after Inspector Otaki left by car,

282
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,861
no one went in or out of the gate.

283
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,271
Nobody did?

284
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,571
It can't be.

285
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:47,771
Maybe there are other hidden corridors or something

286
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:50,371
and the culprit could've gone out of the gate from there?

287
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:53,371
I looked once around the fences of the mansion,

288
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,971
but there was nowhere that you could go out from.

289
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,877
The gate guards said that there are sensors on top of the fence

290
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,471
and if someone were to go over it, they would be caught right away.

291
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:06,871
Then, maybe from a tunnel or something from the mansion?

292
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:11,171
The owner made renovations on the mansion in just a week.

293
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:15,271
There's no way that a tunnel can be dug in such a short time.

294
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,895
That's ridiculous?

295
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,971
Then how did the culprit make it out of the gate?

296
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,871
Moreover, take Kamiyo along?

297
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:23,871
They flew.

298
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:29,571
Hakuya who turned into a vampire with those abhorrent wings.

299
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,271
Cool head, Ruri.

300
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,371
This young police detective said that

301
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,571
there're no such things as vampires, didn't he?

302
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,671
Police detective? No, wrong.

303
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,371
I'm Heiji Hattori! A high school detective from Osaka!

304
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,971
A detective?

305
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,571
I thought you were too young to be a police detective.

306
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,671
You're only a high school kid?

307
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,929
Well, I'm going to check things a bit more,

308
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,671
so will you all wait in the dining room again?

309
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,071
-Hey. -You've gotta be kidding!

310
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:58,371
I was listening to you because I thought you were an officer but...

311
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,939
Honey was killed after all too!

312
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:04,571
I'll protect myself on my own.

313
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:06,571
Everyone... Hey, hold it!

314
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:10,271
Oh. So you're not a police officer.

315
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:14,071
But if you're a detective, are you training under Mr. Mouri?

316
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:18,171
Huh? Why should I train under that goofy?

317
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,271
That's right!

318
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,271
I'm supposed to be getting a certificate of proficiency

319
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,971
from my trainer Mouri soon.

320
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,967
Then, can you figure out

321
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,071
the trick of how the owner swung his body around?

322
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:32,971
Swung?

323
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,271
Remember, the time when the owner stuck his head out

324
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:39,971
from the window of the dining room hanging.

325
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,371
But, before the curtains were opened,

326
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:43,671
the owner's silhouette that was lit up

327
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,983
the flash of lightning came from below

328
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,371
and wasn't upside.

329
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:50,989
Moreover, his body seemed to be like that of a ghost!

330
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,371
If I remember correctly, it was here, wasn't it?

331
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,997
The place where the owner's neck was seen through the window.

332
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,271
Yeah.

333
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:05,971
How about it, Kudo?

334
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:07,871
Just as we figured!

335
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,471
Which means that the thing in question...

336
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,571
Great idea.

337
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:23,021
But this large-scale trick...

338
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
Isn't something that can be done right after

339
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,771
coming to his mansion.

340
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:30,471
Uh, the foursome, do they come to this mansion often?

341
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:37,035
They were here when I was a child and my mother brought me here.

342
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,871
But after becoming a maid, it's the first time I've met them.

343
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:44,171
It's been a year since they've all been here.

344
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:47,045
Everyone asks about how Hakuya is doing

345
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,171
or about his health on the phone.

346
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:53,071
But they rarely come here.

347
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:57,571
That's why I thought that somebody among them was "pregnant"

348
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,471
and gathered here to celebrate.

349
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,061
Pregnant?

350
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:07,371
Because the owner was buying a pool for children

351
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,871
and toy planes by internet shopping

352
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:13,471
which I thought were gifts for the coming baby!

353
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,771
Before I became a maid here,

354
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:17,971
he used to often buy me clothes and such, too.

355
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,371
Is that airplane one that flaps its wings and flies?

356
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:24,671
Yes, it was written so on the invoice.

357
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:29,471
I thought the box was quite large to be a child's toy.

358
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:33,091
But, when I asked Kamiyo who came with Mr. Hagawa,

359
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,771
whether she was pregnant,

360
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:39,097
they said, "No, no way" while laughing.

361
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,871
Then, Kishiharu who came later, was holding a big bag,

362
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:47,105
so I thought that maybe he had brought a gift.

363
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,107
But, he told me that he had his camera

364
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,871
and tools for developing films inside.

365
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:53,111
I also asked Mr. and Mrs. Asanobu Torakura

366
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,971
who came a bit earlier than you did, about it,

367
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,371
And Ruri remarked,

368
00:18:57,371 --> 00:19:00,671
"I wonder if Mina and Mr. Hagawa got back together again?"

369
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:03,121
Then, did you ask everybody else too?

370
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:07,125
Yes, because they came a bit later than you did.

371
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,127
I was given the cold shoulder, though.

372
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,129
Get back together again? Does that mean that...

373
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,871
Mina and Mr. Hagawa were going with each other?

374
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:16,871
Yes. But, it seems that passionate Mina

375
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:20,871
came on too strong for Mr. Hawgawa.

376
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,471
And, before we knew it, Mr. Hagawa had changed partners to Kamiyo.

377
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,271
Then, what about Kishiharu and Ruri?

378
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:30,271
Those two were engaged to begin with

379
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:33,151
but after Yoko passed away because of the accident,

380
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,571
Kishiharu became deeply depressed

381
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:37,771
and called off the engagement.

382
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:42,371
Then, Asanobu proposed to Ruri and they got married.

383
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,071
It seems that Kishiharu

384
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:50,771
really liked Yoko who was the owner's fiance.

385
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,571
On the day of Yoko's funeral,

386
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,171
he was crying more than the owner.

387
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:58,371
But, I heard the maids say that

388
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,671
you were crying a lot too, Mr. Koga.

389
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:03,181
They say it was probably because you got along very well with her.

390
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,183
No.

391
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,185
Things sort of seem so messed up.

392
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:11,571
Yeah. Everyone seems to have a motive.

393
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,671
Oh, it's text mail from Kishiharu.

394
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,671
He wants me to bring sake up to his room.

395
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:22,671
Does he know your mail address?

396
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:24,971
Not only does Kishiharu know!

397
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,871
On the day before they came here,

398
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,471
I sent everyone text mail

399
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,371
that we'd be waiting for them to arrive.

400
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,271
Why go out of your way to do so?

401
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:33,211
Because the other day,

402
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:37,471
the owner gave me everyone's mail address so...

403
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:39,471
I thought he meant for me to greet all

404
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,221
who were coming beforehand, so I sent out the text mail.

405
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,371
I often exchange text mail with the owner, you see.

406
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,071
Then, when he told you to come to the European room also...

407
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:52,371
Yes. I got texted!

408
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,171
-See! -After breakfast,

409
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,971
come to the European room, without telling anyone about it.

410
00:20:56,971 --> 00:21:00,171
Make sure that the butler doesn't see you coming.

411
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,571
But, I saw this mail after noon,

412
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:07,671
so, I ended up standing him up.

413
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:09,771
You didn't notice the mail?

414
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,771
I had completely forgotten that

415
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,771
I was charging my cell phone in the bathroom.

416
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,255
It's from Kishiharu, asking me to come ASAP!

417
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,040
I've got to go!

418
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,259
From the text mail...

419
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:26,171
It doesn't sound like the owner doesn't like her at all.

420
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:29,771
No joke, you mean nobody's coming to eat the pot sticks?

421
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,269
Have they all gone to sleep?

422
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:35,271
No. I think that everyone is up

423
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:37,571
but doesn't feel up to eating.

424
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:41,071
I think it's best that both of you hurry and get to bed.

425
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:44,971
Oh, no. When the pot sticks came out so deliciously...

426
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,771
But we ate most of it already.

427
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,471
True.

428
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,291
What shall we do if Conan and Heiji come to eat some?

429
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,295
We've got more ingredients, so we could just make more, right?

430
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,371
I'm sure the culprit is that person.

431
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,871
Right, Kudo?

432
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:07,305
Yeah. But we have no proof.

433
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:08,471
Besides...

434
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:11,871
The way that Kamiyo was killed.

435
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:15,313
Unless we can figure out that trick, our hands are tied.

436
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:18,771
How did that person go pass the gate

437
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,671
and kill Kamiyo in the forest?

438
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,470
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,060
"Hidden Corridor"

440
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,394
Hattori, doesn't something smell?

441
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:53,960
Sorry, it's the pot sticks. I ate them.

442
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,413
I'm talking about the case.
