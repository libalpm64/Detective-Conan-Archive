1
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,530
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,130
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,730
The legend of a mermaid starts off the new series.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,630
Heiji, Kazuha, Ran and Conan work together again.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,130
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,930
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,530
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,410
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Mystery)"

9
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,110
Good grief, I hope you appreciate what I'm doing.

10
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,810
First, you pop up out of the blue

11
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,010
then you tell me that we've got to go to Fukui on a job

12
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,110
and that's what we're on this crazy trip.

13
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,310
Oh, don't grumble! I'm paying for this.

14
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,810
Now what? So where are we?

15
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,310
What's the name of that island we're going to?

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,410
It's called Bikuni Island, it's just a tiny island.

17
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,910
The locals around here call it,

18
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,310
the island where the mermaid lives.

19
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,710
"Bikuni Island" -Did you say mermaid?

20
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,810
Yeah.

21
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,810
They say there's an old lady on that island that eat mermaid meat.

22
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,110
I've heard about that!

23
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,110
About 3 years ago, there was a big fuss about her,

24
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,210
she's an old lady who has lived forever, isn't that right?

25
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,310
Yes, that's right. I decided to come along

26
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,110
because I wanted to learn the secret of her beauty and longevity!

27
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,910
I get it! You want to snare Hattori with those secrets!

28
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,910
Don't talk so loud!

29
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,710
You've got to be kidding.

30
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:09,510
I hope you're not to tell me our job is find a mermaid.

31
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,510
It's just the opposite.

32
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,710
There were only 3 lines in the letter giving us the job

33
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,210
and the writing was shaky.

34
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,410
This is what it said, "The mermaid will kill me. Help!"

35
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,310
A mermaid is...

36
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,010
Going to kill someone?

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,210
This is serious!

38
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,210
Give me a break, mermaids only exist in fairy tales,

39
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,110
don't expect me to take you seriously.

40
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,910
I don't believe they really exist either.

41
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,710
But the name in the letter got my attention.

42
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,410
The envelope was addressed to me

43
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,910
but the letter was written to Shinichi Kudo.

44
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,810
You should be thanking me.

45
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,510
It might be somebody from your past,

46
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,510
that's why I brought you along.

47
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,810
So did you contact the person who sent the letter to confirm it?

48
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Yes. The sender, Saori Kadowaki

49
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,810
wrote the number for her cellular phone on the letter.

50
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,110
But the first time I tried, someone answered but hung up right away,

51
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,010
I tried again many times but nobody answers.

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,610
On that first call though, I can still hear the sound

53
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,410
coming from the other side of the receiver.

54
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,510
It was the sound of waves and a woman moaning.

55
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,910
-It couldn't be... -Maybe the mermaid already killed her.

56
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,010
What?

57
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,610
Saori Kadowaki is missing?

58
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,510
Yes, it seems she hasn't shown up for work for the past 3 days.

59
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,410
3 days ago, that's about when I got the letter.

60
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,510
Her neighbors are saying that

61
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,610
she might have gone to the main island on the ship though.

62
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,310
Sir, it's almost time.

63
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,910
Yes, be right there.

64
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,210
Well, I've got to go prepare for the festival.

65
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,610
Festival?

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,310
Today's the day of the "Dugong Festival",

67
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,610
it's the island's annual celebration.

68
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,510
If you want to know more about it,

69
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,310
go to the gift shop Saori worked at, it's right at the corner.

70
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,210
Mermaid amulets, mermaid straps.

71
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,310
They've even got dugong cakes!

72
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,210
It's true, this island's got every mermaid item in stock.

73
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,410
What's a dugong, anyway?

74
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,010
Well, it's a mammal that lives in the ocean,

75
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,610
some people say that that's the model for the mermaid is.

76
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,310
They used to live in the southern part of Japan too, long ago

77
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,410
and it was believed that their meat was medicine

78
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,710
and you'd live a long life.

79
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,110
A Dugong Arrow?

80
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,910
Yes, sir. It's a charm to keep you young forever,

81
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,510
only 3 are given away, once every year at the Dugong Festival.

82
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,710
Saori was presented with 1 last year

83
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,010
but she said she lost it

84
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,910
and she was terrified since last week.

85
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,310
She said the mermaid would curse her.

86
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,310
That's hard to believe... a mermaid.

87
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,610
Mermaids do exist.

88
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,710
Nahoko.

89
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,410
There's a Holy Person who gained eternal life

90
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,010
after eating the dugong meat

91
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,510
and whoever possesses the Dugong Arrow

92
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,110
with the Holy Person's hair tied to it that has been blessed by her

93
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,710
will also be granted eternal life.

94
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,810
I don't blame her for running away,

95
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,110
who wouldn't be afraid of the mermaid's curse

96
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,610
after losing an arrow that important.

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,810
Who was that?

98
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,510
That's Nahoko, she and Saori have been friends

99
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,510
since they were children.

100
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,310
And who is this Holy Person?

101
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,410
She's the star of the festival

102
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,010
as well as the symbol of our island,

103
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,810
she's old lady Shimabukuro!

104
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,310
So tell me, how old is the old lady anyway?

105
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,610
Well, there's some that say she's a hundred. Some say she's 200.

106
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,510
If you don't believe me, why don't you

107
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,310
go to the shrine for the festival?

108
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,210
The shrine?

109
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,210
The Holy Person's great-granddaughter, Kimie,

110
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,510
who's also Saori's childhood friend should be there too.

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,710
I think we're being given the run around.

112
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,210
"Bikuni Shrine" -200 years old, that's ridiculous.

113
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,710
My great-grandmother's exactly 130 years old this year.

114
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,010
You can check the birth records that'll prove it.

115
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,010
Good grief, just because she's a little older than most,

116
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,110
everyone exaggerates so much.

117
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,310
A little older?

118
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,010
She belongs in the Guinness Book of Records.

119
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,710
So where is this very old lady anyway?

120
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,710
She's in her room,

121
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,010
blessing the arrows to be presented at today's festival.

122
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,710
Then, you mean, she really eats dugong meat?

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,110
There's no such things as mermaids.

124
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,110
That story's a complete lie.

125
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,310
But what about the Dugong Arrow?

126
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,410
My late mother told me that it was originally a protection amulet

127
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,510
but the people on the island went and started

128
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,410
to call it Dugong Arrow instead.

129
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,210
You've lost your mother?

130
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,710
Yes. She was lost at sea 5 years ago, along with my father

131
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,910
and it seems my grandparents

132
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,710
were also lost at sea before I was born.

133
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,610
How awful, you lost your whole family to the sea,

134
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,710
there must be something behind it!

135
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,710
That's nonsense.

136
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,310
Saori and I went to the main island by boat just recently

137
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,010
and nothing happened.

138
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,110
-You went... -With Saori?

139
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,910
When was that?

140
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,010
4 days ago.

141
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,410
I had a dentist appointment and asked her to come with me.

142
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,110
There's no dentists on this island.

143
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,810
Was there anything strange about her that day?

144
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,110
She was very scared because she lost the Dugong Arrow.

145
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,710
She said the mermaid would curse her.

146
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,010
No matter how hard I tried to convince her nothing would happen,

147
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,310
she wouldn't listen.

148
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,510
You're so stupid.

149
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,510
She wouldn't listen because you don't believe

150
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,110
in the holy one's powers, isn't that right?

151
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,510
Toshimi?

152
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,110
She's the real thing. She really ate dugong meat.

153
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,810
Well, actually, about 3 years ago,

154
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,710
the carcass of a real dugong did wash up.

155
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,610
A dead dugong?

156
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,610
Wasn't it on television about 3 years ago?

157
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,910
The media played it up a lot.

158
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,610
You don't know what you're talking about.

159
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,110
You saw it, didn't you?

160
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,910
The bones were crushed in a very strange way, it was grotesque.

161
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,910
That's enough, Toshimi!

162
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,110
Rokuro.

163
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,210
You shouldn't tell outsiders too much.

164
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,010
If you people are looking for Saori,

165
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,710
why don't you just go to her home?

166
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,710
You might learn something if that drunkard father lets you in.

167
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,510
Nobody seems to be very worried.

168
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,610
That's because Saori fought with her father a lot

169
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,710
and she'd often run away.

170
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,810
Would you mind taking us to Saori's home?

171
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,310
I don't mind. But it'll have to be after the festival.

172
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,910
What do you do at the festival?

173
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,210
Lottery tickets are sold beforehand

174
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,310
and if their numbers match the numbers my great-grandmother picks,

175
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,110
they get an arrow.

176
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,010
It's like lucky number drawing.

177
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,710
Oh, that's right. Would you like to try your luck?

178
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,610
An elderly couple suddenly cancelled this morning

179
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,710
so there are 2 extras.

180
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,810
If you say so.

181
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,010
Whether you win or lose, it's all up to the Gods.

182
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,410
Maybe, you'll be able to obtain eternal youth and beauty

183
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,610
just like the rumors.

184
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,810
I'm kind of excited.

185
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,110
Me too.

186
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,210
"Mikoto Shimabukuro (130), The Holy Person"

187
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,810
It's the Holy Person.

188
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,510
The Holy Person is making her appearance.

189
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,510
That's the Holy Person?

190
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,310
She's so tiny.

191
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,010
It's just an old lady wearing heavy makeup.

192
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,010
She set fire to the door!

193
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,910
It's burning the door!

194
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,210
I get it.

195
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,610
The fire burns the winning number onto the door.

196
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,010
I... I don't believe it. Am I seeing things?

197
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,210
I did it, what luck!

198
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,810
Ran.

199
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,310
I...

200
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,010
I won!

201
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,810
Attention, winners.

202
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,010
The Dugong Arrows will be presented to you in an hour.

203
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,610
Please proceed to the Mermaid's Waterfall.

204
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,910
Now, will the 3 persons who will receive divine favor

205
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,910
step forward?

206
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,910
Yes! Here I am!

207
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,710
Where is the other person? Isn't there anyone else?

208
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,010
"Benzo Kadowaki (52), Saori's father"

209
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,310
"Fisherman" -Here I am.

210
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,810
What is this? That's strange.

211
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,810
I could've sworn that other girl won too.

212
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,010
Yeah, I don't see her around here.

213
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,610
At this time, however...

214
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,210
she was already here at the Mermaid's Waterfall.

215
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,210
Show these 3 with the divine light.

216
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,610
Hey. What's that?

217
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,210
What is that?

218
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,910
That's right.

219
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,110
Long, black hair wafting on a slim body that sways,

220
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,610
it most certainly looked like a mermaid swimming up the waterfall,

221
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,610
shiny and blue

222
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,010
but it was a lifeless body.

223
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,620
Toshimi?

224
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,220
Do you think she killed herself?

225
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,020
Or was she murdered?

226
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,620
Maybe it's neither.

227
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,920
The rope that's around her neck

228
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,220
is the one that's used to rope off the dangerous areas along the river.

229
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,720
What did you just say?

230
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,620
I see.

231
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,420
So it happened like this, it was dark and Toshimi tripped,

232
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,320
she grabbed the rope but the current was too strong

233
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,520
so the nails came loose and as she fell,

234
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,920
the rope got tangled around her neck.

235
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,720
But don't you think that's strange?

236
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,420
The festival was still going on around the bottom of the waterfall

237
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,020
so why did she go into the forest for?

238
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,420
Maybe she was looking for the mermaid's grave?

239
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,920
What?

240
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,220
The mermaid's grave is somewhere in this forest.

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,520
On the night of the festival 3 years ago,

242
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,320
a fire burned the shrine's storage house,

243
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
that's how the mermaid's bones were found

244
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,820
and they were buried somewhere in this forest.

245
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,520
Yes, I remember she was always talking about that grave.

246
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,120
Hold on a minute! You all talk about a mermaid

247
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,620
but how do you know it was a mermaid's bones?

248
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,120
Well...

249
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,420
All the people on the island said it was

250
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,320
but the policeman from the main land

251
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,020
said the bones were that of a middle aged woman.

252
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,320
That's a lie!

253
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,620
He said he could be sure if there were

254
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,520
bones from the lower part of her body!

255
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,420
The lower part of her body?

256
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,920
The main beam from the storage house burned

257
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,220
and fell on the lower part of her body.

258
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,920
But when the beam was lifted off,

259
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,820
there were no bones for where her legs should have been.

260
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,120
That's hard to believe!

261
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,720
Thanks to that fact, the media made a big fuss broadcasting that

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,920
a mermaid's body was found.

263
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,220
And our Holy Person became famous.

264
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,120
But didn't the police say it was a lady?

265
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Yes. They said probably a tourist who didn't win one of the Dugong Arrow

266
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,520
snuck into the storage house looking for an extra arrow

267
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,920
and the fire was caused

268
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,620
when the candle in the storage house was lit.

269
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
A year went by and it was still unidentified

270
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,620
so we went and buried it.

271
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,920
The problem started after that.

272
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,120
Problem?

273
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,920
Grave robbers.

274
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,720
Stupid tourists

275
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
started coming around trying to dig up the bones.

276
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
It seems they heard that mermaid bones

277
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,220
were the elixir of eternal life.

278
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,220
That's why great-grandmother asked someone to help

279
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,220
and they reburied the bones here secretly.

280
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,020
Who did she ask?

281
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,220
I don't know.

282
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,320
All she said was it was someone she trusted very much.

283
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,820
Well, whether it's suicide, murder or an accident,

284
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,720
we'll continue this conversation

285
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,420
after we've taken her body down and the police arrive.

286
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,820
If it was murder, then it's partly Toshimi's fault too,

287
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
coming to a place like this at this time of night.

288
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,120
Aren't you the cold one? Your fiancee just died.

289
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,220
Fiancee?

290
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,820
Our parents arranged that on their own.

291
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,520
I never proposed to her.

292
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,820
Besides, both my father and mother are no longer alive.

293
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,520
Toshimi!

294
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,220
Who is that?

295
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,020
That's Toshimi's father.

296
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,420
Mr. Ebihara, the head of the fisherman's union.

297
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,220
Dad!

298
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,820
Did you call the Fukui prefectural police?

299
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
They said the seas are too rough

300
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
and they won't be able to come until it calms down.

301
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,220
You've got to be kidding.

302
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,320
Hey, lucky for us.

303
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,720
The murderer can't get off the island either.

304
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,520
What do you mean, murderer?

305
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,720
We don't know for sure yet that she was murdered.

306
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Then take a look it.

307
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,420
A swim ring?

308
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,820
Heiji and I found it, it was stuck in the middle of the river

309
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,020
that joins the water from the waterfall to the ocean.

310
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,920
If Toshimi was knocked unconscious then the rope is wound her neck

311
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,120
and then she's put on the swim ring and set afloat,

312
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,320
she'd end up hanging from the waterfall, wouldn't she?

313
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,620
We saw Toshimi at the shrine

314
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,820
2 hours before the fireworks went up.

315
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,520
It doesn't take an hour to get to and from the top of the waterfall.

316
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,220
Which means,

317
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,020
anyone could have committed the crime, man or woman

318
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,420
and the murderer is still on the island!

319
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,620
That's terrible.

320
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,920
Don't worry about it! The murderer will be caught in no time!

321
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,720
When Heiji moves his hat around, he's turned his switch on.

322
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520
He's raring to go.

323
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,220
But you must've fall in love with him.

324
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,520
I'm no match for you if we become rivals.

325
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Kazuha.

326
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
You're so sweet!

327
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,920
Hey, what're you doing?

328
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,020
Listen. If Toshimi was murdered,

329
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,620
you'd better not let that person out of your sight.

330
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,420
I'm talking about Saori's drunk of a father.

331
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,320
Excuse me. Would you like to go to Saori's home now?

332
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
I'll take you since I promised you earlier.

333
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,920
With him in that condition, I doubt he'll be much help though.

334
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,720
Alright then.

335
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,820
I'd like to meet the Holy Person.

336
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,920
Sure.

337
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,370
This house is old.

338
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,070
It doesn't look like they're making too much money

339
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,770
from those Dugong Arrows.

340
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,770
How can you say that? Those platelets cost 500 yen a piece.

341
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,370
500 yen?

342
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,470
The people on this island said the price has been the same

343
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,770
since they can remember.

344
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,170
There are 108 number platelets in a huge box

345
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,670
and everyone lines up then pulls one out.

346
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,470
Then the old woman picks the 3 winning numbers.

347
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,870
What's taking that old lady so long anyway?

348
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,470
Kimie said she'd tell her we want to see her

349
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,570
but she might be tired after today's festival

350
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,070
so we may not be able to see her.

351
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,470
What is that sound?

352
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,370
Are you the ones who want to see me?

353
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,270
Without makeup, she looks like a spook.

354
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,170
Excuse me.

355
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,070
We wanted to know how you picked the winning numbers.

356
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,770
Excuse me...

357
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,570
I just pick them randomly.

358
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,170
Once I used the numbers of the horses that won at the races.

359
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,770
I don't believe this.

360
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,170
Then why don't you sell more of them

361
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,570
instead of being so chintzy and selling only 3?

362
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,570
That can't be helped.

363
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,570
The hair I tie to the arrow is my own and I don't have a whole lot.

364
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,070
Great-grandmother! Your bath is ready!

365
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,670
Excuse me, if that's all you came here for,

366
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,670
I'm going to take a bath now and go to bed.

367
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,070
Wait, I'd like to ask you more.

368
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,170
Alright then, you girlie.

369
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,670
You, the one with your hair tied back.

370
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,270
Who, me?

371
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,770
The Dugong Arrow is really a charm to warn off evil.

372
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,570
If it leaves your person, evil will overtake you.

373
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,970
Men will return to the soil and become heartless demons.

374
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,070
Women will return to water and become silent mermaids.

375
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,570
You must never let it leave your person.

376
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,370
Even her voice sounds wrinkly and she's so pale.

377
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,970
She looks like she could drop dead any minute.

378
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,270
"The Next Day, Ebihara House"

379
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,870
See! I'm glad I brought my school uniform with me,

380
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,870
it's coming to good use.

381
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,970
Are you sure this is okay?

382
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,870
Won't they mind having us showing like this?

383
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,270
No problem! It's a small island,

384
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,470
this'll be the perfect time to question everybody.

385
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,570
Stop smiling like that! This is Toshimi's wake!

386
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,470
Oh, sorry.

387
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,770
Kazuha, did you bring the arrow with you?

388
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,970
Yes. I certainly did.

389
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,270
It's that drunk. He's already here.

390
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,370
Mr. Mouri, I'm surprised you all came.

391
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,170
Yes, well...

392
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,370
By the way, I understand that Mr. Kadowaki didn't go home last night.

393
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,370
That's right.

394
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,370
But I heard he got into a fight with a tourist at a bar.

395
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,670
So he was drinking all night, huh?

396
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,270
I don't see Nahoko around.

397
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,270
Her name was on the sign in sheet though.

398
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,070
Nahoko's here?

399
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,970
She's probably in the restroom.

400
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,070
We'll go check.

401
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,270
Yes, good idea.

402
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,070
Don't tell me you're afraid of thunder?

403
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,770
No, it's not that. Someone's out there.

404
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,870
You're right.

405
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,970
What's going on?

406
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,270
Oh, Heiji.

407
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,970
Somebody's out there.

408
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,170
Are you sure?

409
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,870
Isn't that?

410
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,280
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,940
"The mermaid's grave"

412
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,400
The two are in a pinch in the next episode!

413
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,000
They overcome the danger and their love for each deepens.

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,020
What about you?
They overcome the danger and their love for each deepens.

415
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,100
What about you?
