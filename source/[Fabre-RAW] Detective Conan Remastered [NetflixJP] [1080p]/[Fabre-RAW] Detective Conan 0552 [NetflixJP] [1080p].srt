1
00:00:01,342 --> 00:00:02,742
"Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:05,142
This is a special program

3
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:07,242
that was aired on Nichiuri TV

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:11,642
to choose the nationwide number 1 Mr. Kojima.

5
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,993
The cash to be awarded is 10,000,000 yen.

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,742
Moreover, the hanging scroll

7
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:17,342
that will be awarded along with the cash,

8
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:22,001
is one of the wild boar, deer and butterfly trio

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,342
called the "Bush clover and the wild boar".

10
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:26,005
Genta's father will be entering

11
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:29,742
the Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest.

12
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:32,642
There are 3 categories of tests, which are push up exercise,

13
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:36,015
a singing contest and kanji dictation.

14
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:39,642
The standard set for judging seemed to be quite difficult.

15
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:41,242
Overcoming these difficult tests,

16
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:44,342
only three contestants made it through.

17
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:46,942
And to our surprise,

18
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:50,042
Genta's father was among the finalists.

19
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,042
However, right before the start of the finals,

20
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:54,342
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -the host of this contest,

21
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:57,542
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -Gonsaku Kojima, chairman of the Kojima Group

22
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,542
is pushed down the stairs by someone and killed.

23
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:03,542
The only people using the stairs

24
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:07,142
were the three Kojimas who made it to the finals.

25
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:11,742
Right. Genta's father is also one of the suspects.

26
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:16,342
But which of the three is Genta's father?

27
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,059
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

28
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,442
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

29
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,642
The mystery of the case, as well as Genta's father.

30
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:26,442
Both become clear and the case is solved.

31
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,067
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,842
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:32,071
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:19,022
"The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 2)"

35
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:20,622
"Contestant A's Waiting Room" -I was just

36
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:23,022
waiting in the waiting room

37
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,922
when I heard someone knocking on the door of a room.

38
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,922
A little afterwards I heard the loud voice and sound,

39
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:30,522
so I went out to look.

40
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:34,193
"Bunta Kojima (33)" -Then, I found that old man

41
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,922
lying on the ground, that's all.

42
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:38,922
Did you come right out of the room

43
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:41,522
after you heard the loud voice and sound?

44
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,922
No, I waited a while.

45
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:48,522
Because I thought that this may be some kind of a test.

46
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:52,822
And? Was "hapyakuichi" really written on the paper?

47
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:55,522
Yeah, that's what was written.

48
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:58,222
By the way, how many push ups

49
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:01,322
were you able to finish in 3 minutes?

50
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:06,022
About a 100.

51
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:08,022
Oh, I see.

52
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:11,322
"Contestant B's Waiting Room" -Which means

53
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:14,233
you also heard the knock on the door of a room

54
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,722
and since you heard a loud voice and sound after that,

55
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:21,122
you left the room and rushed over to the site, is that right?

56
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:23,322
Yes.

57
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,422
"Genji Kojima (32)" -I felt a kind of uneasiness,

58
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:26,922
so I opened the door

59
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:30,722
and found that the two others were just about to leave their room.

60
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:34,722
And? On the paper, like you just said.

61
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:36,822
Yes, "shakuhachi" was written on it.

62
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:39,422
"Hapyakuichi" (801) and "shakuhachi" (Bamboo Fluter).

63
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,722
Only the "hachi" (eight) is correct.

64
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:45,122
By the way, what kind of song did you sing today?

65
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:46,822
I sang "Kurodabushi".

66
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:48,267
Would you like me to sing it to you?

67
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,269
No, not really.

68
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,422
Please by all means do!

69
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,022
Huh?

70
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:56,622
"Contestant C's Waiting Room" -Yeah, the same as the other two.

71
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:59,922
I heard a loud voice and sound, so I ran over.

72
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:02,281
"Gankichi Kojima (34)" -Then, I saw that old man

73
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,622
lying on the floor below the stairs alone.

74
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,922
And, on the paper that you saw,

75
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:11,322
the word "ippin" (first class) was written?

76
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,822
Yeah. "Ippin" meaning the best.

77
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:19,322
By the way, can you write the word rose in kanji?

78
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:20,299
Huh?

79
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:23,122
Rose?

80
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,622
I could never write a kanji like that.

81
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:28,722
Hey, what's going on from a while ago?

82
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:31,322
Well, you see...

83
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:34,313
What? Conan asked you to ask them?

84
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:38,317
Yes, sir. He said that if we ask the three questions like these,

85
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:40,622
we may be able to figure out

86
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:43,722
what the real intention of this contest is.

87
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:46,325
Officer Takagi, how was it?

88
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,522
They did a little over 100 push-ups,

89
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,822
sang more or less the same as Inspector Megure

90
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,922
and couldn't write the kanji character for "rose".

91
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:57,022
Don't you think I sing better?

92
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:01,122
He didn't have the lyrics for the song right, either.

93
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,122
I guess so.

94
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:03,722
Were the lyrics incorrect?

95
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:14,353
Yeah, he was supposed to sing "Hinomoto ichi no kono yari wo".

96
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,522
But, he sang

97
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:21,722
"Shinomoto ichi no kono yari wo".

98
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,922
While listening to them sing,

99
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,622
I also recorded the interrogation of the three.

100
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:27,622
Would you like to listen to it?

101
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:29,022
Yep.

102
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:32,371
But, what can we figure out with this?

103
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:35,022
We know that the purpose of this contest

104
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,322
was not to choose the best person.

105
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:38,377
Right?

106
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:40,379
Yeah.

107
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,922
Just what do you mean?

108
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:44,922
I thought we were supposed to choose the number one person

109
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,722
of all the Mr. Kojimas nationwide,

110
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,622
but when we took the results of the push ups

111
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,122
to the judge's room where the chairman was.

112
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,822
Yeah, the contestants have already been chosen.

113
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:59,422
It'll be these 58 people.

114
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:01,922
That's what he said.

115
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,722
Before even looking at the records?

116
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:04,822
Yes.

117
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,022
It was the same even when we took the scores

118
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,222
of the kanji dictation test to him.

119
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,822
Although he seemed to be checking the VTR

120
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:15,422
in which the contestants all ran off over to their answer sheets.

121
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:17,022
Then, what about the singing contest?

122
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:19,122
He seemed to be listening carefully

123
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:21,822
to the recorded voices of each and every contestant.

124
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:25,222
Was the chairman choosing the contestants all by himself?

125
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:30,122
Yes. It seems that he planned to do everything by himself.

126
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:33,222
The chairman even got ready the number sheets and shoes

127
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,222
which were to be handed out to the contestants himself.

128
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,722
But, what did he base his choice on anyway?

129
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:42,222
Inspector Megure!

130
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:45,822
A gun was found inside the chairman's bag that was left

131
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,222
-in the judge's room. -What?

132
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:50,449
And together with it, this paper was found.

133
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,451
-Paper? -Yes.

134
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,453
It is very sloppily written.

135
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,922
"We will surely come to get a hold

136
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:59,222
of the really great best item in the world."

137
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,522
"Bandits Hyakkiyako."

138
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,222
Hyakkiyako?

139
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,522
Is it mean the group of killer robbers?

140
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,922
The thing is...

141
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,122
The chairman wrote in his blog

142
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,922
that he had lost the deer and butterfly hanging scrolls

143
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:15,222
of the set of three he had,

144
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,822
but the fact is the band of robbers

145
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:19,622
stole it from him about six months ago.

146
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,122
The hanging scroll of the wild boar of "Hagi"

147
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:24,922
happen to be out for repair and was spared being stolen.

148
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,722
Was anyone killed back then?

149
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:28,922
No.

150
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,822
The chairman, his wife and the employees

151
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,493
were all drugged to sleep.

152
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,495
But the chairman's pet dog, Gonta,

153
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,322
was slashed in the throat

154
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:42,522
with a knife by the head of that group.

155
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,122
And it seems that the chairman who was still slightly conscious

156
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:50,509
heard what the head had mumbled while leaving,

157
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,822
"I'll spare your life because we have the same surname."

158
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:58,517
"After all, we could be distant relatives."

159
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,522
Did you report this case to the police?

160
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:06,525
No, the chairman firmly told me not to speak of it.

161
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,422
Hey, Officer Takagi.

162
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:13,722
Could it be that the three suspects...

163
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,722
Now that you mentioned it,

164
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,539
all three of them were like that.

165
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,922
I see.

166
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:25,022
I finally got it.

167
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,322
But...

168
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:30,822
no matter if the chairman told you to keep things quiet,

169
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:34,922
not telling the police about the break-in

170
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:38,022
and the hanging scrolls being stolen is unthinkable.

171
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,922
I'm very sorry.

172
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:44,563
But, he said that he would avenge Gonta's death,

173
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,122
so to not say a word to anyone.

174
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:49,022
Then, don't tell me that this Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest

175
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,522
that the chairman planned was...

176
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:55,822
That's right, he wasn't trying to look for the number one Mr. Kojima.

177
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:58,577
But rather to look for the culprit who took Gonta's life

178
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,022
and to avenge his death.

179
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:02,581
And he was going to kill the culprit with the gun

180
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,222
that was hidden in the judge's room.

181
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:08,122
Because there are many kanji characters for the name Kojima

182
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:09,722
is usually written as "island".

183
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,522
But just like in the title of this event,

184
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:12,591
the "island" surname of the people in this contest

185
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,593
is kanji character with the word "bird"

186
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,595
with the radical "mountain" to the left, right?

187
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:17,822
Is he right?

188
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:19,122
Yes, sir.

189
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:22,601
The surnames of the three finalists

190
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:26,022
are all written that way.

191
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:28,222
Come to think of it, Chairman Kojima's surname

192
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,022
was also written in the same kanji character.

193
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,422
So, does that mean that the chairman

194
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,613
knew the name of the head of the band of robbers?

195
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,922
He didn't know it.

196
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:39,322
He figured it out

197
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,222
from what the head of the group of robbers said,

198
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:44,922
"I'll spare your life because we have the same surname."

199
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:49,522
"After all, we may be distant relatives".

200
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,522
I see. So if he were to be a relative,

201
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:54,122
his name had to be written with the same kanji character Kojima.

202
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:55,722
Which means that

203
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,922
it's likely that he narrowed the contestants down to those whose names

204
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,422
were written with the same kanji character

205
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:01,322
when looking through the papers that came in.

206
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,222
I think so.

207
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:05,322
We, the staff were also thinking it's strange

208
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,522
that all the contestants had surnames written

209
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,422
in the same kanji character.

210
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,622
However,

211
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,122
I can see up to that point,

212
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,522
but how did he narrow it down after that?

213
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:19,722
Uh, the shoes that everyone was wearing when doing push ups

214
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,722
were prepared by the chairman, right?

215
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,222
Yeah. That's right.

216
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:27,522
Then, you checked what size who wore, right?

217
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:31,122
Yeah. Because the chairman told us to do so.

218
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:35,822
You said that Gonta was found dead in the yard, right?

219
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:36,675
Yeah.

220
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,922
Hey, hey, just what are you getting at?

221
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:41,422
If it was in the yard,

222
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:43,522
wouldn't it most naturally still be there?

223
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:46,222
The culprit's footprints.

224
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,687
I see! Shoes traces!

225
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,322
The chairman chose the contestants

226
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:55,722
according to the size of shoes they picked.

227
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:58,697
Then, the singing was to hear the voice?

228
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:02,122
Yes. If the chairman had heard the head robber's voice,

229
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,822
there's no doubt about it.

230
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:07,422
The voices of the remaining finalists sounded similar too.

231
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,422
If so, the kanji dictation was for him

232
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,222
to check out the handwriting of the culprit.

233
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,322
He wanted to find the man

234
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,222
whose handwriting was similar to the writing

235
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:17,522
that was written on the letter left behind by the robbers.

236
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:19,622
I don't think so!

237
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,422
Because the head of a group of robbers

238
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,723
would never go out of his way to write a letter

239
00:12:24,922 --> 00:12:26,725
that he would leave behind.

240
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,727
I'm sure that letter was deliberately

241
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,022
written in handwriting unlike the usual,

242
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:32,522
or it's the handwriting of another person

243
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,733
who was made to write the letter.

244
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,122
Then, what was the dictation match for?

245
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:39,722
To decide whether the man is right or left handed.

246
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:42,222
If he slashed the dog's neck with a knife,

247
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,622
you can tell if the culprit is left handed or right

248
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:45,922
by looking at the wound, right?

249
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:49,822
Officer Takagi, the three suspects all used the same hand, right?

250
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:54,422
Yeah. The hand that Mr. Bunta Kojima was smoking with

251
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:57,622
and the hand that Mr. Genji Kojima was drinking tea with

252
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:59,222
as well as the hand that Mr. Dankichi Kojima used the towel

253
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:02,522
to wipe his perspiration were all their left hands.

254
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,122
I see.

255
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:06,422
That's why he was able to choose the contestants

256
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,422
just by watching the VTR of them running over

257
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,122
to the answer sheets.

258
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:13,322
I guess not with the voice,

259
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:14,773
but as far as it goes for the shoes size or what hand they dominantly use,

260
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:18,122
he could've just had the men write it in when filling out the entry forms.

261
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,522
He probably thought if he did that,

262
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:22,781
the culprit would find out that he was looking for him.

263
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,322
I see.

264
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:27,422
But kid, you sure have great deduction ability.

265
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:30,422
I got mail secretly a while ago

266
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:33,322
from an older detective who told me.

267
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,222
So, it was Kudo, after all.

268
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:40,422
If so, the point is the paper the chairman

269
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:43,422
showed to the three contestants he picked out.

270
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,803
Yes.

271
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,622
He figured out who the culprit was after showing the man the paper

272
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,122
and went to see him.

273
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,622
I think he fell off the stairs

274
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,922
fighting for the paper.

275
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:57,722
All three suspects had different answers

276
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:00,819
for the word they saw.

277
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,722
Moreover, we body checked all of them

278
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,522
and investigated the waiting room too,

279
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:08,622
but the paper in question wasn't found.

280
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:13,522
Shinichi told me he knew where the paper is.

281
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:19,822
Of course, he also knew what was written on the paper.

282
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,841
Conan's really late.

283
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,322
Maybe Genta's father

284
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,847
is involved in some case after all.

285
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,222
Well, let's let Conan handle this.

286
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:33,522
True.

287
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,522
So, Genta cut that look off your face

288
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,857
and wait for him to come back.

289
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,022
That's right.

290
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:43,622
Your Dad would never do anything bad, Genta!

291
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:46,865
I'm not really all that worried.

292
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:51,822
The only thing is I don't want them to get into a fight.

293
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:53,222
Fight?

294
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:54,422
Yeah.

295
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:56,622
My Dad's got a bad temper,

296
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,122
but is a push-over,

297
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,879
and he hates injustice.

298
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,881
He's got a bad temper?

299
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:04,883
He's a push-over?

300
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,722
He hates injustice?

301
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,889
He's indeed what you call a 100% "Edoite".

302
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,122
I guess I'll go check after all!

303
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,622
-Genta! -Excuse me.

304
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:23,304
"Evaluation Room" -What the hell's going on?

305
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:25,604
Gathering us in a place like this.

306
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,404
We finished interrogation a while ago, didn't we?

307
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,909
Don't tell us you figured out who the culprit is?

308
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,604
Oh, well...

309
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:34,104
I want to confirm with you once again

310
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:37,404
what was written on the paper.

311
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,704
It's "Hapyakuichi". I wrote "801".

312
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,404
It was "Shakuhachi" (Bamboo fluter).

313
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,304
It was "Ippin" (First class).

314
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,504
Huh?

315
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,404
What're you guys talking about?

316
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,704
A number was written on it, wasn't there?

317
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:51,604
Yes, I thought it was a number too.

318
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:53,504
Don't be silly!

319
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,104
There couldn't be a simpler kanji!

320
00:15:56,104 --> 00:16:00,404
Maybe they were all shown different papers after all.

321
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,941
-Yeah. -I'm pretty sure

322
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,204
that this was what was written on the paper.

323
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,904
Right, it was that character!

324
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,949
See? It's "hapyakuichi"!

325
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,304
But if you turn it upside down,

326
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,504
it can be read, "shakuhachi", can't it?

327
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:19,504
Then, when you said "shakuhachi",

328
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:22,004
you actually meant "hyakuhachi"?

329
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:22,961
Huh?

330
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,704
Yes, that's why I said "shakuhachi".

331
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,704
What the hell are you talking about?

332
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:28,967
Let me see it!

333
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,704
If you turn the word "ip" up this way,

334
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:35,504
it's read "ippin" meaning the best!

335
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,904
It's true that it could be read that way.

336
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:41,004
But it's difficult to read "pin" as the kanji "thing".

337
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:43,304
Well, it can't be helped!

338
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:44,983
Because that character "pin"

339
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,004
is written in one stroke, a habit of the writer.

340
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:50,004
It's hard to tell if it's part of the sentence,

341
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:52,991
unless you look really carefully and are used to seeing it.

342
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,404
It's really difficult to read it "pin" meaning thing.

343
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:58,997
Isn't that right, the head of the robber group?

344
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,804
Come to think of it, the kanji character "pin" in the letter

345
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,304
that was left behind by the group of robbers saying

346
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:06,204
they were stealing the greatest thing

347
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:07,704
looked similar to the "pin" here!

348
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:09,504
Of course they look similar.

349
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:11,009
I had Officer Chiba

350
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,011
copy the word "ip" and "pin"

351
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:14,704
and just pasted them together.

352
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,304
In other words,

353
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:19,504
the chairman copied these same characters on the Japanese paper

354
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,904
and showed them to you.

355
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,904
He was looking for a person who would read this not as a number,

356
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:26,004
but rather as the kanji character "pin".

357
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,504
And, you flew right into the trap he set up.

358
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,704
Don't be ridiculous.

359
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:34,204
If you so insist,

360
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:35,804
show us the Japanese paper!

361
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,304
Do you know, sir?

362
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,204
That Japanese paper is special

363
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,704
and is made with the fallen leaves of a type of mulberry tree

364
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,404
called a paper mulberry

365
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:47,504
and is highly toxic.

366
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:50,404
So, if you mistakenly lick it.

367
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:56,304
Don't tell me that you...

368
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:58,804
Ambulance.

369
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,804
Please hurry and get me an ambulance!

370
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:03,504
I ate that Japanese paper!

371
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,404
Then, you admit it?

372
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,804
That you got into a fight with the chairman over that paper,

373
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:10,404
he fell down the stairs

374
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:12,604
where you left him to die and you fled.

375
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:15,073
Yeah, I admit it.

376
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,004
I admit it, so hurry and call an ambulance!

377
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,077
While you're at it,

378
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:23,081
will you also admit that you're the head of the band of robbers?

379
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:27,085
Right, it's me! I'm the head of "Hyakkiyako"!

380
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,404
As soon as he walked into my waiting room,

381
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:32,804
that old man while grinning said...

382
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,093
Long time no see,

383
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:41,099
the head of the band of robbers who killed my pet dog.

384
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,404
I thought that you'd come back

385
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:45,904
to get the hanging scroll of the wild boar

386
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:48,304
that you failed to steal back then.

387
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:50,604
But don't you worry.

388
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:55,113
I may just forgive you depending how you decide to act.

389
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,704
If you want to flee, I won't stop you.

390
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,119
I'll simply report you to the police.

391
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,604
I've got your face right inside my TV camera,

392
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,127
so I've got this paper that'll serve as evidence too.

393
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,104
Since... since he said that I thought I'd be in trouble,

394
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:15,133
so I tried to snatch the paper away from him

395
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,304
then the old man fell down the stairs.

396
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:21,139
Therefore, you left the chairman there to die and fled.

397
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,304
Then, you swallowed the paper to hide the evidence.

398
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:27,504
Yeah! So, hurry and call an ambulance, will you?

399
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:28,904
Or, I'll die!

400
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:31,149
You'll be fine.

401
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,004
Mulberry leaves are frequently used to make Japanese paper,

402
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:36,204
and they're not that poisonous.

403
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:38,404
What... what are you saying?

404
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:40,904
But, unlike you, sir,

405
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,504
the mulberry is black on the outside, but white on the inside.

406
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:47,165
I think this taught a black on the inside person a good lesson.

407
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,167
We'll listen to the rest of story at the station.

408
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,104
Oh, no. I was just joking.

409
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,204
I was just playing along with that brat's joke

410
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:55,604
and was talking gibberish...

411
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,904
Just what do you think?

412
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:05,183
Enough of your lies!

413
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,904
What you just spitted out,

414
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,904
I was listening with these two ears of mine!

415
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,304
Cut out your blabbering!

416
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:15,804
Like I just said, I was only joking.

417
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:19,204
Oh, you still insist on playing dumb?

418
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:20,304
You third rate human!

419
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,904
Third rate human.

420
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,704
I run a liquor store, you know!

421
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:26,904
I'm used to taking on drunkards!

422
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,804
Or better yet,

423
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:31,209
you want me to stick my arm all the way down your throat

424
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:34,404
and pull that Japanese paper out of your throat

425
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,504
together with what you ate for lunch today?

426
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:40,404
Oh, no. I confess.

427
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,604
Dad?

428
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:46,404
Dad, what's up?

429
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:47,804
Genta.

430
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:51,904
Don't tell me that Genta's dad is the culprit?

431
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,704
Dad.

432
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,704
Just what're you doing in a place like this?

433
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,504
Oh, Genta!

434
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,904
What's with those glasses?

435
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:25,323
Oh, this is...

436
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:29,104
What? Mom told you to wear it?

437
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,604
You mean to enter this contest?

438
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:35,104
Yeah! She nagged me saying

439
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,335
that I look smarter with then on so to wear them!

440
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:41,339
But, it looks like your granny's glasses

441
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:42,804
and the lens are so strong

442
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:46,004
that I can't keep my eyes open.

443
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:49,004
Talk about tough. She also told me a whole lot of other stuff like

444
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:53,351
to watch my language or not fight and all.

445
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:56,604
But, why did you read that character "shakuhachi"?

446
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:59,357
Yes, yes. Officer Takagi told us

447
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:02,204
that you read "shakuhachi" instead of "hyakuhachi".

448
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:05,804
It's because he's an "edoite".

449
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:10,104
Although they think they're pronouncing something "he" or "hya",

450
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:14,704
most "edoites" can't help but pronounce the words "she" or "sha".

451
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,104
Well, it's something like a dialect.

452
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,404
Sir, did you remember that you sang "Shinomoto ichi"

453
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:23,381
at the part that goes "Hinomoto ichi no kono yari wo"

454
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,383
in the song Kurodabushi?

455
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:27,904
Huh? Is that how it sounded?

456
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,387
I see.

457
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:32,804
That's how you figured out he was Genta's father.

458
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,704
Yeah, because the other two

459
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,104
pronounced the words "hikaeshitsu" (waiting room) and "hitori" (alone)

460
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:39,404
the way they were supposed to be pronounced.

461
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:42,904
But, dad, if we went a little later than we did,

462
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:45,004
you would've gotten into a fight again, right?

463
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:48,704
Well, never mind the details.

464
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:52,604
Like they say, fire and fighting are like spice to edoites.

465
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:59,204
I mean talk about totally out of date.

466
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

467
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,423
"Left handed"

468
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,412
How about you, Officer Takagi?

469
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,596
I'm a top-notch officer, so you see.

470
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:09,427
I think I heard something, but I must've heard wrong.

471
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,440
Oops.
