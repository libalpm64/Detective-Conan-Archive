1
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:03,404
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,304
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:06,804
An upper classman suddenly disappears.

4
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:08,304
While we trace her footsteps,

5
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:10,304
we catch glimpses of a black shadow.

6
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:11,804
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,604
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:15,404
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,860
The battle with the Black Organization has settled for the time being.

10
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,460
We were all leading a peaceful school life...

11
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,160
but we got word that Shoko Amemiya, a 4th grader disappeared.

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Moreover, she is said to resemble Haibara.

13
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,460
Don't tell me that the Black Organization has come all the way to school?

14
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,760
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

15
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,660
And? Do you remember what she bought?

16
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
I think it was...

17
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,160
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

18
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,160
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

19
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
but the instant we walked away,

20
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,460
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

21
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,560
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,460
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

23
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,360
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

24
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,060
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

25
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,660
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

26
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,360
Her personality resembles Haibara.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,260
Maybe...

28
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:10,673
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 2)"

29
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:20,373
-Conan? -Conan?

30
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:36,173
What're you doing, Conan?

31
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,673
What's he up to?

32
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:03,273
Conan!

33
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:23,873
Just as I thought.

34
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:26,573
There's no doubt about it!

35
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:28,873
Just what're you doing, Conan?

36
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:32,673
If you want a PET bottle, I'll give you mine.

37
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:38,173
Let me call headquarters and ask them to search for the girl!

38
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,473
Wait!

39
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,773
Before that,

40
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,073
how about checking out the place that crossed my mind?

41
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:46,873
The place that crossed your mind?

42
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:50,173
Which means that you figured out where she is?

43
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:51,173
Yeah.

44
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:56,173
I'm not sure if she's really there yet or not, but let's try going there.

45
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:58,373
After stopping by at the drugstore though.

46
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,773
The drugstore?

47
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:03,173
Oh, and Mr. Tanihata.

48
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,673
Yes?

49
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:08,373
Will you please give me some hot water that you have by the cash register?

50
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:11,273
Gosh.

51
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:12,773
Thanks to you, Conan,

52
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:15,273
this is my second time today doing cleaning monitor work.

53
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:23,773
Hey, Genta!

54
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,473
Cut out playing. Hurry and finish cleaning up!

55
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:30,273
She already said that twice to me.

56
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:32,873
Ayumi, did you go get it for me?

57
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:35,673
Yep! See.

58
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,073
Thank you.

59
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,873
Let's go then!

60
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,973
"Beika Pharmacy"

61
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,073
That'll be 470 yen.

62
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,373
Would you like a package?

63
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,873
Nope, it's fine just like that.

64
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,273
Okay. Thank you.

65
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:51,773
What did you buy?

66
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:54,173
Stick type formula for babies.

67
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:55,873
Formula...

68
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:01,273
What are you going to do with that?

69
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,573
Ayumi,

70
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,973
where's the PET bottle that Genta finished drinking out of?

71
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:05,973
Here!

72
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,873
The hot water that I had the employee at the convenience store put inside

73
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:09,373
is still warm.

74
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,373
Thank you.

75
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,873
I pour the formula inside this bottle of hot water.

76
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,673
Then, shake it and mix it well.

77
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,773
Conan, just what are you going to do with it?

78
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:27,673
Don't tell me that you're going to raise a baby.

79
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:30,673
Yeah, that's just it.

80
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:39,173
It's no ordinary baby though.

81
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,073
Wait a minute!

82
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:44,473
We're looking for Shoko Amemiya,

83
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:49,473
the 4th grade girl who disappeared on her way to school, you know.

84
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:51,773
Never mind the baby!

85
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:55,473
I'm sure that the girl couldn't just watch and do nothing either.

86
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:58,873
Okay, let's have Officer Yumi show us the way then!

87
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:03,773
To the old warehouse where you planning to go

88
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,473
to issue tickets for illegally parked cars.

89
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,873
Okay.

90
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,073
Hey, are you sure she's in a place like this?

91
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:28,973
Talk about a dirty warehouse.

92
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:31,273
Cough, it's so dusty.

93
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:32,873
Right, that's why...

94
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,860
You have weak nasal membranes.

95
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,560
I wasn't always like this though.

96
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,660
Right?

97
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,860
Yes.

98
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,260
Officer Yumi, do you have any pets at home?

99
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,060
Yes, two dogs!

100
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,360
Sta and Hachi!

101
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
You mean you're surrounded by dogs at home, too?

102
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes.

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,460
Come to think of it, yes.

104
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,660
Then, you just haven't realized

105
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,960
that you're allergic.

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,860
Allergic?

107
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Yep. The cause of your sneezes is probably not dust.

108
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,260
Conan, where are you going?

109
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Okay! Let's go, too!

110
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,860
Hey!

111
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,560
I'm going, too!

112
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,660
Wait, you guys!

113
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,960
I'll go!

114
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,060
Ms. Miyamoto.

115
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Are you all okay?

116
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,060
Officer Yumi, this way!

117
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Wait! My butt is stuck.

118
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,560
They're cute!

119
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Cute?

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,160
I think the cause of Yumi's sneezes is them.

121
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,260
The cause of my sneezes are the kitten?

122
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,960
Right. It's not dust.

123
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,360
Your reaction was due to the dandruff that they have.

124
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,160
You mean that I'm allergic to cats?

125
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
Yep, most probably!

126
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,360
But this place is pretty spacious, and you can't see any dandruff!

127
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,560
Cat dandruff is very small and light!

128
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,660
That's why they go unnoticed

129
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,360
even if they're drifting in the air for a long time!

130
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,960
I see!

131
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,560
The one last thing that the girl and Ai had in common

132
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,060
that Mitsuhiko wanted to tell us about

133
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,660
was maybe that they both like animals?

134
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,060
Right, that's it!

135
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,560
That's what it was!

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,160
Which means that she wanted to walk home with us today

137
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,360
because she wanted to show us these kittens

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,360
in hope that someone would take the kittens home with them.

139
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,660
Yeah.

140
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,060
Her parents probably either do not like animals or cats,

141
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,760
so she couldn't tell her parents

142
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,660
and was taking care of them secretly by herself.

143
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Look. She cut off the bottom part of the PET bottle

144
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,560
to make a milk container.

145
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,860
I see.

146
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,960
Because back at that convenience store,

147
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:37,573
they were out of paper plates and cups.

148
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:42,673
That's why she substituted it by cutting the PET bottle.

149
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:43,973
Yeah.

150
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:48,373
Which means that she stayed back in Tokyo without going to Kyushu

151
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:51,573
to feed these kittens milk.

152
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:55,473
Then, it's understandable that Shoko would suffer from lack of sleep.

153
00:10:56,773 --> 00:11:01,073
She was probably worried about these kittens and couldn't sleep.

154
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,673
Well, I don't think that was the only reason

155
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:08,373
she suffered from lack of sleep though.

156
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:19,873
Hey, why are you throwing the milk away for?

157
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,973
Shoko went through a lot of trouble to get that milk!

158
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,673
Because the problem was this milk!

159
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,873
Cats do not have the enzyme to break down the lactose in milk,

160
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,273
and the nutrients

161
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:36,673
in the milk of grass-eating cows and meat-eating cats differ.

162
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,873
So if milk is given as is to cats,

163
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:42,373
it will give them an upset stomach and they may stop drinking all together.

164
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:45,273
That's if you warm up baby formula for humans

165
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:51,673
to about 38 degrees and dilute it with 2 parts water and give it to them.

166
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,073
They're drinking, they're drinking!

167
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,473
The fact that the kittens didn't drink the milk

168
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:03,073
was one of the things that she was worried about, too!

169
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,673
It seems that she thought that the kittens would drink

170
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:08,473
if she changed the dirty dishes.

171
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:09,873
Of course this is an emergency measure

172
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:14,773
if there are no pet shops nearby and you cannot get milk for cats.

173
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,073
And?

174
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:19,573
Where is the girl,

175
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,773
Shoko Amemiya?

176
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,373
Yeah.

177
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:24,873
Strange.

178
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:27,973
I thought she'd still be here because she is worried.

179
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,573
What?

180
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,073
Conan?

181
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:35,973
I don't know what it is, but...

182
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,073
Let's go!

183
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,573
Not again.

184
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,373
My butt's stuck again.

185
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:47,773
Where's he going?

186
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:49,373
Is it this way this time?

187
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:51,873
My butt hurts.

188
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:55,973
What?

189
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,173
There was another one.

190
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,773
There are three all together.

191
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,973
I wonder why only this one was outside.

192
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,273
Now what?

193
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,073
Where is it?

194
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:35,973
This is...

195
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,873
What's that?

196
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:47,973
A broken piece of the blinker of a car.

197
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:54,173
It probably shattered off when it bumped into the telephone pole.

198
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,873
The piece is still brand new,

199
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,573
so I think the accident happened just recently.

200
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:05,373
But I don't think there were any reports of accidents near here.

201
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:06,373
Look.

202
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:08,659
Isn't this...

203
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,060
human blood?

204
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,359
It goes all the way from the telephone pole to in front of the warehouse.

205
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,459
And over here!

206
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,659
There are traces of a car braking.

207
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:27,359
Could it be that Shoko was run over by a car?

208
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,759
Yeah, we can't really say,

209
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,560
but it's quite likely.

210
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,959
What...

211
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,100
Yeah, I can't say for sure,

212
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,100
but the possibility that a car was involved in some way is high.

213
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,800
Most likely when Shoko carried the kitten,

214
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
it slipped out of her hand.

215
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,200
She went after the kitten,

216
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,100
and when she jumped out in the street,

217
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,800
she ran into the car.

218
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
Which means...

219
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Is it hit-and-run?

220
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,500
No. If so, the driver would've left the girl behind and fled.

221
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,300
The fact that no report of an accident have not been made yet,

222
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,300
means that there are no eye-witnesses.

223
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,300
If so, where did Shoko go?

224
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,200
Where do these blood stains lead to?

225
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
The blood stains return.

226
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,500
They're returning to where they began?

227
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,100
Are the blood stains those of the driver?

228
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,200
If so, the thinkable thing is...

229
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,800
Officer Yumi,

230
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,000
can you check the hospitals in this area?

231
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,100
Okay.

232
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,900
Thank you very much.

233
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,200
Come to think of it, isn't the Niide Hospital near here?

234
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,300
Huh? Conan!

235
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,500
Hello...

236
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,000
What brings you all here?

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,300
Hey.

238
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,900
Is the owner of the car parked in front of the hospital here?

239
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,300
That man had a wound that required about three stitches,

240
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,500
in addition to a slight concussion,

241
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
so he's still asleep in bed.

242
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Did he mention anything about a girl?

243
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,300
Rather, he came carrying her in here.

244
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,800
He came in here smeared with blood saying that he ran over a girl

245
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,083
so he asked for help.

246
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:42,100
Smeared with blood?
so he asked for help.

247
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,383
Smeared with blood?

248
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:45,883
Oh, no.

249
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,383
The man was the one smeared with blood.

250
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,883
The girl

251
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:54,683
is asleep on the bed over here

252
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,583
and Hikaru is examining her.

253
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,683
Is she hurt?

254
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:01,783
No.

255
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:04,683
She's asleep because she didn't have enough sleep.

256
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:07,083
It seems she didn't sleep at all last night.

257
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:12,583
She told me so when she woke up a while ago.

258
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,183
She thought she was run over by a car,

259
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:18,183
fainted and fell asleep.

260
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:21,883
Then why didn't you contact the school about this?

261
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:25,883
I did ask for the telephone number of her home and tried calling,

262
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,083
but no one answered.

263
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,483
She went to sleep again before I got to ask her what her name was.

264
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,983
Her school bag seems to have been inside the man's car.

265
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:40,383
I was thinking of asking her for the details after she got up

266
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,683
because she looked to be so deeply asleep.

267
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:45,583
But I'm so glad.

268
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:49,083
I'm glad that Ms. Amemiya is okay.

269
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,483
Really.

270
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,283
What's the matter?

271
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,883
Today was not a good day for me.

272
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:00,683
I didn't know what I would do if something had happened to her.

273
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,783
Hey, don't cry, Mr. Hirayama.

274
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:07,383
Excuse me.

275
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:13,283
I think you should contact the school about this quickly, don't you?

276
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,200
That's right!

277
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,300
My cell phone, phone.

278
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Come on!

279
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,600
It seems that the teacher wasn't one of them.

280
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
No, I guess not.

281
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
I found it!

282
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
Hello. This is Hirayama!

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,300
I wonder what is was though.

284
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,800
His gaze. That looked as if he was glaring at us.

285
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,500
Well, since his eyes are bad,

286
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
he probably squinted to take a good look.

287
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,300
Which means he's wearing glasses with lens that don't fit his eyes?

288
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,100
He did mention, didn't he?

289
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,200
He fell off the stairs today.

290
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
He had a wound on the top part of his eye.

291
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,800
He probably dropped or cracked his contact lens at that time,

292
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
so he decided to wear his glasses that he used to use before

293
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
with much weaker lens than now for the time being!

294
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,600
Don't you remember? He tried to touch his wound

295
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,100
and his finger pushed his glasses, making them slip.

296
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,200
It's proof that he usually wears contact lens!

297
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,800
I'll bet you want to say that's why his action looked so stupid.

298
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
If he were one of them,

299
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,900
isn't there a possibility that he deliberately do so,

300
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,800
to keep us off our guard?

301
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, that thought raced through my mind for an instant.

302
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,500
But I was convinced that he wasn't one of them

303
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
from his remarks that followed.

304
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
Who are you children?

305
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,800
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

306
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
That remark convinced me!

307
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
How?

308
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,000
An elementary school teacher would usually ask,

309
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
"Where are you students from?"

310
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,400
We were all carrying our school bags back then.

311
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,300
The more so if he were one of them disguised as a teacher.

312
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
That's how I figured out that he was a teacher

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,200
who had lost his contacts and was using glasses just for the time being,

314
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,600
who couldn't see us very well.

315
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
But what if he was perfectly acting out his role as that type of teacher?

316
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,500
There's no reason for him to act out such a complicated person.

317
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Besides, if he thoughtlessly happened to say something like that,

318
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,100
he's no enemy.

319
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
The ones that I'm afraid of are people like Bellmot...

320
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,300
who sneak up from behind with precise accuracy.

321
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,900
That's what happened today.

322
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm glad that the girl Shoko was found.

323
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,400
Shoots.

324
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,900
And? What happened to the kittens?

325
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,300
The new teacher took one,

326
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,100
and Dr. Niide took the other two.

327
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,100
He said he's going to see if any of his patients would be interested.

328
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,600
Dad?

329
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
Why don't we take one of the cats?

330
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
No way!

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,800
It'll scratch the house all over and ruin the rooms!

332
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,000
Besides, if we get a cat,

333
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
it could become a big headed woman.

334
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,100
Are you talking about mom?

335
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,700
I wonder.

336
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Besides, we don't need any more new free loaders.

337
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,400
Gosh.

338
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh, right!

339
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,400
Talking about new, today at school...

340
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,900
Hey, Conan.

341
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,400
Conan, listen too.

342
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,700
Are you asleep?

343
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,900
I guess so much happened today that you're tired.

344
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,500
And? Did a new teacher come to your school, too?

345
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,600
Nope, a new student.

346
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,300
A boy came.

347
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,100
He looks a lot like that announcer, Reina Mizunashi!

348
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,400
He said that he has nothing to do with her and that he just looks like her.

349
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,100
He said that he wants to come to our place once,

350
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,600
so I'll introduce him to you when he does!

351
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,920
Next Conan's Hint:

352
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
"Bad sleeping posture"

353
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,440
Haibara, do you have good sleeping posture?

354
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,500
Would you like to sleep with me and find out for yourself?
Haibara, do you have good sleeping posture?

355
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,560
Would you like to sleep with me and find out for yourself?
