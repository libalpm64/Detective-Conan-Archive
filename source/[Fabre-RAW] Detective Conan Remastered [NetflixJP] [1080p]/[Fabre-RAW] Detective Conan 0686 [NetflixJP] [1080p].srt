1
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:36,929
Wait!

2
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,529
"Mao Misawa (5)" -Candy, wait!

3
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:40,929
Candy!

4
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,031
Wait!

5
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:56,529
Candy...

6
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,039
"2:30 pm"

7
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,041
"Time until explosion: 90 minutes"

8
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,529
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

9
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,529
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

10
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,047
A delivery van is loaded with a bomb.

11
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,429
The Youth Detective Squad only have seconds to carry out rescue.

12
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:12,051
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,053
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,055
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:03,888
"The Car Carrying the Time Bomb"

16
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:05,388
"Mouri Detective Agency"

17
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:07,488
How late is the Beika Library open again?

18
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,788
I wonder if we'll make it in time...

19
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,788
Ayumi!

20
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:13,088
Candy's in trouble!

21
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,488
Mao?

22
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:15,888
What's the matter?

23
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:17,588
Who is it?

24
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:18,988
If I remember correctly,

25
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:21,788
it's the girl who lives in Ayumi's neighborhood.

26
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:22,888
What?

27
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:26,688
Candy got on the delivery van and went along with it?

28
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:30,988
Ayumi, I don't know what to do.

29
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:32,688
Don't worry.

30
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:36,588
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad will find her for you.

31
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,788
So, don't worry.

32
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,588
Let's go, Mao.

33
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:44,203
Ayumi.

34
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,888
Hey, hey, that's not work for the Detective Squad...

35
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:48,207
It is.

36
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,988
-Candy! -Candy!

37
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,988
Isn't that the car?

38
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:06,988
Mao?

39
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:09,188
Yes, the one with the fox mark.

40
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,388
The FOX courier.

41
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:14,233
Candy! Candy!

42
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,388
Up we go.

43
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,888
Candy, where are you?

44
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:20,239
Candy.

45
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,588
What is it?

46
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:22,988
Hey, you!

47
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:25,488
Officer Chiba.

48
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:26,988
Conan?

49
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:28,588
She's not here.

50
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,088
Looks like she's in a different car.

51
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,588
Candy.

52
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,388
Don't worry, we'll find her soon.

53
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:39,888
You can count on us, the Youth Detective Squad, okay?

54
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:41,888
-You can count on us. -Leave it to us!

55
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,588
Officer Chiba?

56
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:48,888
Did something happen?

57
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,271
Oh, no.

58
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,288
Hey, Chiba!

59
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,275
Nothing on this side. How about there?

60
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,488
Conan?

61
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,788
Are working on a case or something?

62
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,588
Yes, sort of.

63
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,788
Anyway, it's dangerous for you kids,

64
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,287
so hurry on home.

65
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:13,588
They seem to have gotten hold of one on 3rd Avenue, so let's go.

66
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:14,588
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:15,688
Be careful, then.

68
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:17,688
Good bye.

69
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:18,988
Something's going on.

70
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:20,588
Yes.

71
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,888
You guys wait here.

72
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,288
Hey, Conan?

73
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:27,088
You too, Ai!

74
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:28,888
For goodness sake.

75
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,688
Hello.

76
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,888
Hello, Ran.

77
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,688
What is it, Conan?

78
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:40,319
What's Pops Kogoro doing now?

79
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,588
I'll go look, so hold on.

80
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,588
Please...

81
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,888
One more, please.

82
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,688
Oh, come on, dad.

83
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:51,788
Just as I thought.

84
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,788
Never mind then.

85
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,788
It's nothing. Bye.

86
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:01,188
Yes, Megure here.

87
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,988
Inspector, this is Mouri.

88
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,988
Oh, it's you.

89
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,088
I'm sort of busy right now.

90
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,488
Does the case have something to do with a delivery van?

91
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,688
What? Where did you get that information?

92
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:15,888
I happened to see Officer Takagi and Chiba investigating.

93
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,088
I see.

94
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,288
And what kind of case is it?

95
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,888
No, I can't...

96
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,888
If it's something I can help out with,

97
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,363
please let me know.

98
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:26,888
Inspector!

99
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,369
To tell you the truth, Mr. Mouri.

100
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,888
There were two successive explosions from late noon today.

101
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,088
What?

102
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,788
The first victim was Kozo Tonomura,

103
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,288
a district court judge.

104
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:43,288
The second victim was Kazuhiko Saeki,

105
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:45,188
a district attorney.

106
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,888
Although both victims were seriously hurt,

107
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:50,389
fortunately their lives are not in danger.

108
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,188
Both were time bombs delivered by a courier.

109
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:59,788
From the fingerprints that were found on the debris of the first bomb,

110
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:02,188
a man called Utsugi,

111
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,088
who was serving time in prison until last month,

112
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,988
was arrested on charges of violation of the explosives control law.

113
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:10,988
His motive was to take revenge on those who indicted and punished him,

114
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,288
that he held an unjustified grudge against.

115
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:16,188
According to Utsugi's testimony,

116
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,788
there's one more bomb that was sent out.

117
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,788
It went to an investigator

118
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,788
who had arrested him in the past.

119
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:25,588
I see.

120
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:28,088
That's why they were investigating the courier trucks.

121
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:29,188
Yes.

122
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:32,188
But, the bad thing is...

123
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,388
Inspector Megure!

124
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:36,435
We've confirmed that former Police Detective Kaneko is all right.

125
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,988
It seems the bomb hasn't been delivered to him yet.

126
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,188
Okay.

127
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,441
If we're going to believe Utsugi's testimony,

128
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,088
the time remaining for the last bomb to go off

129
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,988
is 4:00 in the afternoon.

130
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:49,388
An hour and a half to go.

131
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:50,449
Inspector.

132
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,188
We received an answer from the FOX courier.

133
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:57,188
About the reception desk slip for the package in question,

134
00:07:57,188 --> 00:08:00,088
the delivery time has been specified

135
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,688
between 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm today.

136
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:04,088
And, where's the bomb now?

137
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:08,488
The courier company is trying to contact the delivery van right now.

138
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,588
We've asked to have the bomb squad dispatched too.

139
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,688
They'll head for the site as soon as it is found.

140
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:15,088
I see.

141
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,588
I guess we'll make it in time somehow.

142
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,479
Yes, hello.

143
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:25,088
What? The delivery van was stolen?

144
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,988
What?

145
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,388
Yes, this is van number four.

146
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:31,688
Bomb?

147
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:34,988
-Give me the key, I tell you! -What do you think you're doing?

148
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,507
Kingo Ebisawa, 28 years old.

149
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,509
Ginji Kaniyama, 25 years old.

150
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:53,588
They both have previous police records of committing robbery.

151
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:56,888
Before noon today, they broke into Marukane Loan in Beikacho

152
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,088
and robbed one million yen.

153
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,288
The two that were on the surveillance camera

154
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:04,188
and the description that the courier driver gave, matched.

155
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:08,527
Marukane Loan? If I remember correctly...

156
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,788
Yes. That corrupted loan shark.

157
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:15,588
But why would they steal a delivery van?

158
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,888
It seems that their getaway car stalled,

159
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:22,088
and was abandoned nearby.

160
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:26,088
It was probably to intercept the wireless radio of the police.

161
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,588
There was a wireless also found in the car that they abandoned.

162
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:30,988
I see.

163
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,553
That's why they robbed a delivery van equipped with a wireless too.

164
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:38,557
Yes. They're probably totally unaware that a bomb is loaded inside.

165
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,588
How could this have happened?

166
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,688
We're doing the best we can right now.

167
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:49,888
But, we still have no idea of the whereabouts of the delivery van.

168
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:51,288
I see.

169
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:54,088
By the way, where was the delivery van stolen?

170
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,888
In the residential district of 3-Beikacho.

171
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,588
I see.

172
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:03,688
Then, if I find anything here, I'll let you know.

173
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:04,583
Thanks.

174
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:05,988
If you will excuse me...

175
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,988
Don't tell me it's that delivery van.

176
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:13,488
Yes, maybe...

177
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,088
Conan, how long do we have to stick around here?

178
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:20,599
Really. Do you really want to look for Candy or not?

179
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,888
Please the two of you!

180
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,688
Yes, of course we'll look for her.

181
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:30,288
Mao, where did Candy get on the delivery van?

182
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,788
From The Metropolitan Police Department to all stations.

183
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:34,888
Continue investigations centering around the area

184
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,888
where the getaway car of the robbers was found.

185
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,088
The vehicle to be pursued is a FOX delivery van.

186
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,788
We did it!

187
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:43,388
Kinji. We can deceive the cops now and get away.

188
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:44,388
Yeah.

189
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:47,188
Thanks to you being a good mechanic.

190
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,988
What's with you?

191
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:54,088
You're cute.

192
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:57,688
"2:50 pm"

193
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:58,988
"Time until explosion: 70 minutes"

194
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:03,488
Right here. This is where Candy got on the FOX car.

195
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,288
And, it turned that corner right away and you lost sight of it?

196
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,088
Yes.

197
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:12,651
But... Isn't it no use to come here anymore?

198
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,988
I'm sure the van's gone far away by now.

199
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:20,659
But, at least we can get an idea of which direction it headed for.

200
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:21,488
Is it true?

201
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:24,988
Yeah. To the right is the exit of a one way street.

202
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,088
To the left, the street is under construction and closed off.

203
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,669
All the side streets along the way

204
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,888
are not big enough for the delivery van to make it through.

205
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:35,188
Which means...

206
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:37,488
It went straight down this street!

207
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,688
That's right.

208
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,488
All right! Hurry, hurry!

209
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:44,388
We did it!

210
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:46,988
The cars are stalled because of a traffic jam.

211
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:49,588
At this rate, maybe we can catch up with the van.

212
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,688
But, which way?

213
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:55,588
Right? Left?

214
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:57,788
Which way do we go?

215
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:00,699
From the psychological state of the getaway culprits,

216
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,288
it is highly improbable that they would cut across the traffic jam

217
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,088
and go over to the other side.

218
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:07,588
This way.

219
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,788
Wait, Ai.

220
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,788
Hurry, hurry!

221
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,888
You're right, Ai.

222
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,888
Just in case.

223
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:17,388
Hello, Doctor Agasa?

224
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:27,088
Darn! Isn't there a way to bypass the traffic?

225
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:28,388
Come on, man!

226
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:32,488
Hey, Kinji, won't you stop by at a convenience store?

227
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,735
The dog and I are hungry.

228
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,088
What the heck is wrong with this?

229
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:40,739
Darn it! Darn it!

230
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:44,088
To think that they would even deliver a dog by courier.

231
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:46,745
They even forgot to write the address of where to send her.

232
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
Where are you going?

233
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,188
Only joke.

234
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,488
Cut out the noise.

235
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,388
Come on over here and do something about this navigator.

236
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,188
Hey, did you know?

237
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,288
That stuff can help people look for us,

238
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,888
like tell them where we are and stuff.

239
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:03,588
What?

240
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:06,188
I thought I saw it in a drama or something,

241
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,788
so I broke it when we got on.

242
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,888
Oh, really? Good job.

243
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,781
There they are.

244
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,088
300 meters ahead!

245
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,388
We did it.

246
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,388
You're not getting away.

247
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:30,388
Candy.

248
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:36,795
No joke!

249
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:37,788
Oh, no!

250
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:40,088
And we came all this way!

251
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,188
Candy!

252
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,388
"3:10 pm"

253
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:47,988
"Time until explosion: 50 minutes"

254
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:56,815
They're nowhere in sight.

255
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,188
Darn!

256
00:13:58,188 --> 00:14:00,188
We almost caught up and yet.

257
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:01,288
Candy!

258
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,188
Mao, are you all right?

259
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:14,833
Sorry to keep you waiting.

260
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,288
-Doctor Agasa! -Doctor Agasa!

261
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,388
Good timing.

262
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:19,488
Hurry, Doctor Agasa.

263
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:20,488
I know.

264
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,588
So which way?

265
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:38,857
There not here.

266
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:41,188
Where'd they go?

267
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:43,888
They may have taken a side road again.

268
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:44,888
What?

269
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,788
We've got no way of finding them, then!

270
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,188
Now what?

271
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,688
It's going to explode and 4:00 pm, isn't it?

272
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:53,688
We've only got 40 minutes more.

273
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:55,888
-What? -Bomb!

274
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,877
Doctor...

275
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,588
You didn't know about it?

276
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:04,388
-What do you mean? -What do you mean?

277
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,588
I guess there's no choice but to tell them about it.

278
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:11,288
Yeah. The thing is...

279
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:14,588
A time bomb's going to explode at 4:00 pm?

280
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:18,088
Candy... What's going to happen to Candy?

281
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:21,288
Boy! What're the police doing?

282
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,901
Since they have the license plate number

283
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,188
why don't they hurry up and pursue them

284
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:25,988
or set up road blocks or something?

285
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:27,288
What about the wireless?

286
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,888
Why don't we try calling on them directly, and tell them that?

287
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,488
It's dangerous because a bomb is loaded in the car.

288
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,913
I'm sure they're doing all they can already.

289
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,788
But the fact is, I'm sure it's pretty difficult to specify

290
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:42,288
which of the many FOX courier delivery vans that are going around town

291
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:43,988
is the one that's carrying the bomb.

292
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:45,388
Besides, it seems that the culprits

293
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:48,927
were listening to the wireless of the police to begin with.

294
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,688
If a checkpoint is carelessly set up or we call out to them by wireless,

295
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:53,488
and they decide to abandon the car somewhere,

296
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:54,933
it'll really be a problem.

297
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,935
Then, what should we do?

298
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,588
Candy. Candy.

299
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,945
Sorry to keep you waiting, doggie!

300
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:09,888
Cute.

301
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,288
May I carry it?

302
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,488
-So cute. -Okay, doggie, want to go?

303
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,388
Hey, Ginji! Let's go!

304
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:20,959
Come on, just a little while more.

305
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,888
Geez.

306
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:23,888
"3:30 pm"

307
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,388
"Time until explosion: 30 minutes"

308
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:28,967
Okay! I've got no other choice.

309
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,969
You guys, wait here in the car.

310
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:35,388
Doctor, standby so that you can move the car out right away.

311
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,988
Okay.

312
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,388
Wait, Conan!

313
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,888
Hey, Conan!

314
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,388
What're you going to do?

315
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:44,983
Yes, Megure, here.

316
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:46,488
This is Mouri.

317
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,288
Inspector, if I remember correctly,

318
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:52,088
you said that the two were listening to police radio communication?

319
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,993
Yeah, that's how we see it.

320
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,997
If so, please do as I say from now.

321
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:01,988
Yeah.

322
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,488
What?

323
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,888
But, that's...

324
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:11,009
Okay, I got you.

325
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,188
Connect me to the communication control center immediately!

326
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:16,188
Contact Takagi and Chiba too!

327
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,488
Roger!

328
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,788
Are you men really from FOX courier?

329
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:31,029
How come you're not wearing a uniform?

330
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,031
The one with the FOX mark?

331
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,588
Ginji, let's go!

332
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:39,588
Oh, no.

333
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:42,388
If those kids notify the police...

334
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:43,688
Kingo.

335
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,588
If you speed like that, it won't be a laugh

336
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:48,088
if you get caught for speeding.

337
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,288
Oh, yeah.

338
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:52,688
That's true.

339
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:54,588
From The Metropolitan Police Department to all stations,

340
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:57,055
perform checkpoints from the following areas.

341
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,388
All cars on the move, please take appropriate action.

342
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:02,188
From the intersection of Inner Circular Route 3-Kurinishi-cho,

343
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,688
to the intersection of Tenmondai Mae.

344
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:05,063
Kinji.

345
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:08,288
Map! The map!

346
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,188
Looks bad, Kinji!

347
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,488
If we keep going as is, well hit the checkpoint.

348
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:15,073
What? Darn.

349
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,688
If... if we go that way, we'll run into the next checkpoint.

350
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,988
-Tell me earlier! -Go right here.

351
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:26,088
Next, go left, then right!

352
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:31,388
Next, right, no, I mean left!

353
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,388
-Shape up! -The Haido intersection.

354
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:34,588
Next, next...

355
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:35,888
next, go left!

356
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,095
Okay!

357
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,488
We did it! We got out of it!

358
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:49,588
There are no more checkpoints, we've made it through!

359
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,488
There she is!

360
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:58,788
Candy!

361
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,088
Oh, yeah.

362
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,888
Just as would be expected of Conan.

363
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,588
How did you do it?

364
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,788
I had Pops Kogoro tell Inspector Megure

365
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:09,688
to give out false checkpoint information.

366
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,488
I see.

367
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,388
And you gave out directions for a side street out

368
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:17,135
and lured them there.

369
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,488
That's right.

370
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:22,388
The FOX delivery van there, freeze!

371
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:24,688
There!

372
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,145
Watch out!

373
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,288
Bye.

374
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:32,388
"3:45 pm"

375
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,888
"Time until explosion: 15 minutes"

376
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:37,988
-It's not here. -It's not here...

377
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:40,188
The bomb's still in the delivery van.

378
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:41,188
What?

379
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,588
Candy?

380
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:44,588
Doctor, open the trunk!

381
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:47,165
Hurry. Only 12 minutes to go.

382
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,688
No.

383
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:58,788
Not this either.

384
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:03,181
Hey, so, you're Candy?

385
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,588
Hey! What do you think you're doing, kid?

386
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:09,187
I found it.

387
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,188
Darn, there's not enough time.

388
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,788
I can't possibly throw it out in a place like this.

389
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,195
Hey, sirs!

390
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,088
Can you take me to some place spacious?

391
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,488
This is a bomb!

392
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,088
-Bomb? -Bomb?

393
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:27,205
No way.

394
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,888
Throw him out.

395
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:30,688
Okay! Hey, Kinji.

396
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,888
It's true!

397
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,088
Two others were delivered by the delivery van

398
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:35,888
and people have already gotten hurt too!

399
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,688
This is the last one.

400
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:40,188
It'll explode in a little while.

401
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,231
Kid, hang onto something!

402
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,233
Ginji! The map!

403
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,288
Okay, Kinji!

404
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:02,988
There's no place, none, nearby.

405
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:04,488
Let me see.

406
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:05,588
Two more minutes to go.

407
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:06,888
I know!

408
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:08,988
Where? Where are they?

409
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:11,249
There they are!

410
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:15,253
Go here!

411
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:18,288
Darn.

412
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,688
Where? Where are they?

413
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,088
One minute to go.

414
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,588
There's no more time.

415
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:24,888
Don't give up.

416
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:28,688
20 seconds to go.

417
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:29,988
Where are you?

418
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,269
10 seconds to go!

419
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,275
-There they are! -Three,

420
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,488
two, one.

421
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,088
Oh, no.

422
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,788
Too late.

423
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,888
Awesome!

424
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:01,288
That was close.

425
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,588
Cut it out.

426
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,988
Okay, okay.

427
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:07,988
Candy.

428
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:18,188
-Candy. -The Youth Detective Squad does it again!

429
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,888
Well, just as would be expected of Mouri.

430
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,403
"Mouri Detective Agency" -It was fantastic.

431
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:49,407
Well, I can't take anymore.

432
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:55,413
Really! It's about time you got up, dad.

433
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,020
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,680
"Will-o'-the-wisps".

435
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,350
The Youth Detective Squad did it!

436
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,427
Here's a prize candy for you.

437
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,800
We've had enough candy already.
