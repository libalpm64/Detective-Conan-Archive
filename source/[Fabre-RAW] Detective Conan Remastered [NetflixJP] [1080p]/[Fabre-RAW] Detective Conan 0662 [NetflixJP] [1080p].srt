1
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,529
Pops is helping an elderly for free?

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,129
According to Mrs. Takae Kiritani who is the landlady of an apartment,

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,993
Pops visits her every week

4
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:15,995
and seems to be helping out with any problem or trouble

5
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,729
the people of the neighborhood may have.

6
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,929
Although Ran and I found it hard to believe,

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:23,029
we waited for him to come over to Mrs. Kiritani's house.

8
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,005
But the man who appeared, Ryohei Onda

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,929
"Ryohei Onda (21)" -was nowhere close to resembling Pops.

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,009
He turns out to be the boyfriend

11
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,529
of Mrs. Kiritani's granddaughter who was worried about her,

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:37,110
so he posed as Pops' imposter to keep watch over her.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,019
Although the case of Pops' imposter was easily solved,

14
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,929
the real case was just about to begin.

15
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,629
A scream was suddenly heard from the apartment building next door.

16
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,029
When we rushed over, we found the resident of the apartment room,

17
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:54,033
Mr. Gensuke Denkawa had bled to death.

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,429
The other residents of the apartment

19
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,329
were the ones who screamed when they found the corpse.

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,829
The victim died the night before that.

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,329
Judging from the circumstances, it was first thought to be suicide.

22
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,047
But it's not. This is a homicide!

23
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:11,229
And the killer is one of the three residents

24
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,629
who discovered the corpse.

25
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,629
If all cases were men,

26
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,429
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

27
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,429
Even a fake Kogoro can make perfect deductions.

28
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,429
The mysteries behind the Death case are solved.

29
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:44,083
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,085
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,087
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:16,482
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 2)"

33
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,782
"Junji Hyodo (28), Apartment Resident" -Hey!

34
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:25,482
Can we go now, officer?

35
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,082
"Kumi Bannai (22), Apartment Resident" -We've already found out that

36
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,982
the channel couldn't have been changed unless Mr. Denkawa was alive.

37
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:31,982
"Ken Ishigame (64), Apartment Resident" -Isn't it about time

38
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:33,882
you let us go back to our rooms?

39
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,982
Oh, but we haven't solved the problem about...

40
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,082
That's not our problem!

41
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:40,782
We just came back from the hot spring, and we are tired!

42
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:42,201
So...

43
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,282
That's enough, all of you!

44
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:47,582
Interrupting someone when they're talking

45
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:50,582
is nothing but plain arguing!

46
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:52,582
"Takae Kiritani (70)" -If you have something to say,

47
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:56,682
"Apartment Landlady" -do so after you hear the other person out!

48
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:59,882
Step aside, will you?

49
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,223
That goes for you too, officer.

50
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,782
There's a detective right before your eyes,

51
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:09,882
so why don't you ask him for his opinion?

52
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,233
Well...

53
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,282
Satisfying your own pride isn't going to get you anywhere.

54
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:20,782
Oh, no. Hold it there, mother.

55
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,241
"Mother"?

56
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:26,245
Oh... No, no. I mean granny.

57
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,782
You see, I haven't gotten my deduction together yet.

58
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:33,082
The landlady has a loud voice, doesn't she?

59
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:36,682
Yeah, but many elderly people are like that.

60
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:38,682
But that's because when they get older,

61
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:41,082
it becomes more difficult for them to hear, right?

62
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,882
The landlady seems to be able to hear us normally, doesn't she?

63
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,782
That's true.

64
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:50,682
Well, I hear there are older people who want to portray

65
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,582
that they are young, alive and kicking by raising their voices.

66
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,582
You see?

67
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:59,482
Oh. It sounds like a phone call.

68
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:05,682
Hello. Hello?

69
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,682
That's strange. It's not connected.

70
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:11,482
Maybe you got an e-mail? Please show me.

71
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:12,682
Okay.

72
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,882
Oh, my. You're good at it, little boy.

73
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:20,299
My granddaughter taught me how to use it,

74
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:24,303
but I just can't seem to remember the functions of the buttons.

75
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:25,882
I think if it was some time ago,

76
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:29,382
you could've remembered it like you do the keys of the piano.

77
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:31,182
I guess so.

78
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:33,082
Piano?

79
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,482
An e-mail from her granddaughter?

80
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,082
No way.

81
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:41,382
Because of her husband's work...

82
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,482
Her granddaughter is married?

83
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:46,682
She even has a child, and she doesn't look like a university student.

84
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:50,782
So, when he said he was the boyfriend of the landlady's granddaughter,

85
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:52,331
it was totally a lie.

86
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,882
Then, who on earth is he?

87
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,882
The mail's from your granddaughter.

88
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,282
Oh, it's from her?

89
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:02,982
Granddaughter?

90
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,343
Let's put that aside.

91
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:07,282
Do you remember what time was it when the zapping happened

92
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:09,682
at your house last night, landlady?

93
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:13,182
Well. I think it was around sunset.

94
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:16,355
Do you mean the channels changed one after another,

95
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,682
paused for a while

96
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,082
and then continued changing again?

97
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:22,782
Right, that's right. That's how it was.

98
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:27,282
That's why I thought some bad vibes came in from outside.

99
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:30,369
More so because it stopped when I closed the curtains by the window.

100
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,082
Just as I thought.

101
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,082
I've figured out the trick.

102
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:37,682
And the one who did it is probably that person.

103
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:39,682
But I have no proof.

104
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,082
If my deduction is correct,

105
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:44,982
the culprit should still be holding the evidence.

106
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:51,982
Hey, we're getting nowhere like this.

107
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:54,382
So I think we should...

108
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,182
"Kogoro Mouri"

109
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,182
Ask Detective Mouri, who is a professional

110
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:01,982
at solving criminal cases to deduce this case.

111
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,782
I think so, too.

112
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:06,982
-I agree. -What?

113
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:11,382
Why not? Let Detective Mouri handle this case alone.

114
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,582
No...

115
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:17,782
So, how about it? Mr. Sleeping Kogoro!

116
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:21,382
If this is a homicide and the culprit is among one of us,

117
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,782
-don't you think it's strange? -Right!

118
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:26,425
What was that loud sound

119
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,427
that we heard from the TV back then

120
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,982
when we were just about to leave for the hot spring?

121
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:34,433
Not only the sound. The channel was being changed too,

122
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,982
and he turned off the TV when we told him to.

123
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:42,441
So, Denkawa should still be alive then, right?

124
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:46,882
Mr. Denkawa died last night, didn't he?

125
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,682
If so, there's no way that the culprit could be any of us

126
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,882
who just got back from the hot spring a while ago.

127
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:53,982
If you want to detain us any longer,

128
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:58,457
then solve the case with the famous deduction that you're so proud of.

129
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,782
I... I still haven't...

130
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:02,482
Listen here.

131
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,582
Even if Detective Mouri can't solve the case,

132
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:09,582
we have no intention of letting the three of you go just yet.

133
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:11,082
When you broke down the door,

134
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:14,473
one of you threw the key near the corpse

135
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,082
and tried to make it look like this was a locked room.

136
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,477
This hasn't been cleared yet, you know.

137
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,782
Don't you think that's strange, too?

138
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:24,282
The police are always so reliant on Detective Mouri,

139
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,482
and yet you're ignoring him this time.

140
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:31,682
Don't tell me that the police are using Kogoro Mouri's imposter

141
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:35,882
as a means to get something out of us?

142
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:40,782
What are you saying? He's the real Detective Mouri!

143
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:43,382
Would you like me to disclose to everyone that he's an imposter?

144
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:46,182
But... But I promised Ran...

145
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,507
Forget the promise!

146
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:51,082
This guy lied to us that he's acting as dad's imposter

147
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:53,882
because the landlady's granddaughter asked him to do so.

148
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,515
We don't know what he's up to!

149
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,517
Well...

150
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,782
Then, I will do as you please.

151
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:05,482
I, Kogoro Mouri shall reveal the truth behind this case.

152
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,529
Very interesting.

153
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,382
No. That wasn't me, you see.

154
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:17,282
Hey, you're taking it too far despite being an imposter.

155
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:21,582
I'll help you, then, Pops.

156
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,482
Wait... What...

157
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:25,082
Don't worry.

158
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:28,082
I called the real Pops just a while ago,

159
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:31,182
and he told me the truth behind the case.

160
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:33,582
Play along with me, okay?

161
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,682
Conan!

162
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,482
Yes, okay!

163
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:41,482
I'll try asking the officers to do as you say, Pops!

164
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,582
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

165
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,582
Conan, no. He's not...

166
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,567
Help me too, Ran!

167
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:52,571
It seems he wants us to borrow a lot of things!

168
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,573
Conan?

169
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,282
Don't worry.

170
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:59,982
Because the real Sleeping Kogoro is right here with us!

171
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,589
Hey. Just how long are they going to make us wait?

172
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,091
It seems that they're bringing a lot of things into the room.

173
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:18,091
It's pointless using devices that weren't originally in this room.

174
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:21,191
We've only brought the same items as the ones that were in the room.

175
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:22,891
We were told not to use things

176
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,291
that were left in the room to test the trick.

177
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,607
The forensic officers who took the corpse away told us so.

178
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:29,991
A trick?

179
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:32,611
You're still saying things like that?

180
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,191
What do you have to say?

181
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:37,591
No... Well...

182
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:40,291
Don't worry!

183
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,391
Just say it like I told you, and it'll be okay.

184
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:45,191
Don't flinch.

185
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:50,291
Make them believe that you're Sherlock Holmes.

186
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,191
How about it?

187
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:57,691
Hello! It's July 2nd, Monday.

188
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,639
This is the 9 o'clock evening news.

189
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,291
Who turned on the TV?

190
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,643
Beats me.

191
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,991
But it's not one of us for sure.

192
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,191
Maybe somebody's still in the other room?

193
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,691
No, there isn't anyone.

194
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:14,991
Well, you can turn on the TV if you set the timer.

195
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,655
Just what are you talking about?

196
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,991
Now, here's the third question!

197
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,659
He hit it! It's a big one!

198
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,291
It's zapping.

199
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,291
What... What's going on?

200
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:28,191
Somebody is actually in the room, right?

201
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:31,391
-Wait! -Today is Christmas!

202
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,791
It's no surprise that a miracle may occur.

203
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,291
Fry the onion until it becomes brownish.

204
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,691
Big Osaka takes the lead, thanks to Higo's goal.

205
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:40,991
This is a homicide.

206
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,191
The remote controller of the TV is on the fan.

207
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:45,991
I... I see!

208
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,991
The clothes pin held down the channel button of the remote controller

209
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:52,991
that was fixed onto the fan with its neck facing downwards!

210
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,291
This way, each time the neck of the fan swings

211
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,191
and turns towards the TV,

212
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:04,691
the channel changes and it will sound like it's zapping.

213
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,291
I see.

214
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,391
The TV switched on because the programs were preset.

215
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,691
If it were a news program,

216
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,691
others would think that it was airing in real time.

217
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,991
If the timer of the fan

218
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:17,491
was set to turn on two to three minutes later

219
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,891
and the neck starts to swing,

220
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:22,721
it would sound like zapping.

221
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,491
But, how was the TV turned off?

222
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:29,791
We certainly heard the TV being switched off.

223
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,091
I think it was turned off using the off timer of the TV.

224
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:35,291
Idiot! If the TV was preset to switch on,

225
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,491
it should've been off till then.

226
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,991
And if the TV isn't on, the off timer doesn't work.

227
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:42,191
So he says.

228
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,743
Right. That's...

229
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:46,745
Don't worry.

230
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,791
How was that done, Mr. Mouri?

231
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,757
As you can see,

232
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:04,191
another fan besides the one with the swinging neck was used.

233
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,891
The on-off switch of a TV remote controller

234
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,891
was held down by a clothes pin on this other fan.

235
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:10,291
Then, the other remote controller was placed on the stand of this fan

236
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,191
and turned towards the TV.

237
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:16,491
A leaflet was placed in front of the stand of the fan.

238
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,591
All that needs to be done after that is to set it so that this fan

239
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,891
would switch on a few minutes after the fan with the swinging neck.

240
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,491
The leaflet would be blown away by the wind,

241
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:29,391
and the sensor of the remote controller would no longer be blocked.

242
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,391
Thus, the TV would be switched off.

243
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,291
It would give off the impression

244
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,991
that someone had been watching TV while zapping,

245
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:40,799
but turned off the TV after getting complaints.

246
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,801
That's why the leaflet was found on the mattress.

247
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,291
By the way, the fan was operating for a while

248
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,891
even after the TV was switched off.

249
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,791
And since the model of the TV was coincidentally

250
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,591
the same as the one of the landlady's,

251
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:57,791
each time the fan turned towards her house,

252
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,291
it caused the TV in her living room to start zapping, too.

253
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,823
So, it wasn't caused by the books on the table?

254
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:08,291
No. It was a side effect of the trick the culprit used.

255
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,091
But who on earth would've schemed such a trick?

256
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:15,191
When we came into this room, there was no such set up.

257
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,291
Can't you see?

258
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:22,841
The remote controller of the TV is fixed to the fan with band aids.

259
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,291
If I remember correctly,

260
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,291
you said you fell when you tripped over the corpse's foot, right?

261
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,391
So what?

262
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,791
Don't tell me you removed the band aid from the fan

263
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,791
-and stuck it on yourself? -It's because I was bit

264
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,491
by a mosquito at the hot spring!

265
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:40,191
I showed it to you on the train when we came back, didn't I?

266
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:43,591
But I can't tell if it's the same band aid I saw back then.

267
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,991
You thought the culprit used it to commit the crime,

268
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,391
so you fixed it on with the band aid, right?

269
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,591
No.

270
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,791
It probably only took you all about 10 seconds

271
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,191
to bust the door open, turn on the light

272
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,291
and discover Mr. Denkawa's corpse.

273
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,879
I wanted to try and see

274
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,491
if you could stick another band aid on in such little time,

275
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:06,391
so I intentionally used a band aid.

276
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:08,091
Very well, Officer Takagi.

277
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,491
I will turn my back for 10 seconds,

278
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,591
so can you try it?

279
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,391
Yes.

280
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,291
10, 9, 8...

281
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,291
7, 6, 5...

282
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,291
4, 3...

283
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,791
2, 1, 0!

284
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,591
-Wait. -How did it go?

285
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,791
-Did you stick it on? -No.

286
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,491
I was able to stick it on,

287
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,791
but it's all wrinkled as I was rushing.

288
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,691
The culprit could've had more time than that.

289
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:40,919
Mr. Ishigame was having trouble turning the light on right away.

290
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:44,091
It would be the same even if more time was available.

291
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,991
Because it would've already been dim before the light was switched on.

292
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,929
Judging from the way Mrs. Bannai was operating her cell phone,

293
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,791
she is likely right-handed.

294
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,935
It's tough to neatly stick something on her right elbow and finger

295
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,691
using her left hand that she normally wouldn't use.

296
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,891
The same goes for the compress that Mr. Ishigami has

297
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,791
on his right shoulder.

298
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,947
The same method is used when applying a compress and a band aid,

299
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,291
but it would be impossible to peel off either one

300
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,891
and stick it back on nicely without being seen by anyone.

301
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,291
Of course, instead of sticking the band aid or the compress back on,

302
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:21,291
the culprit could also have crumpled it up and hid it in the pocket.

303
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,961
But under such a circumstance

304
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,091
where it's very likely that the police would carry out a body check,

305
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:29,591
it is difficult to think that the culprit would hide it like that.

306
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,391
The only option left is something

307
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,491
that won't arouse suspicion even if it's somewhere on the person,

308
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,191
as well as something that is very easy to retrieve.

309
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,691
Mr. Hyodo.

310
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:40,491
That hair band that you used to tie your hair a while back

311
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:43,991
is the only possible answer!

312
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:48,591
If you use it as you can see right now.

313
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,989
It works seemingly well!

314
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,991
You tied your hair up on the spur of the moment

315
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,591
to make it difficult to check on later, isn't that right?

316
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:56,995
Well...

317
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:58,997
He's really going for it.

318
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,591
He's an imposter and yet he looks so genuine.

319
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:03,791
No. Maybe he's even more detective-like

320
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,991
because he's not asleep.

321
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,891
The key to using the trick is

322
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,991
how quickly the culprit could erase traces of the trick

323
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:15,013
and retrieve the tools used to carry it out after entering the room.

324
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:17,691
Since you were the one who entered the room first

325
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,791
to turn off the alarm clock,

326
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,021
you could remove the remote controller from the fan

327
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:26,391
after bumping into it and knocking it over.

328
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:29,027
If you bend down in order to stop the alarm,

329
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,391
you could also remove the clothes pin

330
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:33,591
that held down the remote controller without being suspected

331
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,391
as well as remove the hair band

332
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,791
that was hooked onto the back of the fan, right?

333
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:43,791
But, did you witness me doing that or not?

334
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,591
I'm asking if you have proof

335
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:49,047
that I used my hair band to carry out that trick!

336
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,049
Proof?

337
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,391
Come to think of it, I haven't told him anything about that.

338
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,591
If I remember correctly, there was blood

339
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,057
on one of the remote controllers, right?

340
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,391
Yeah. It looked like the blood was scraped.

341
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,291
In other words, if traces of the scrape touched

342
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,991
the hair band you used to attach the remote controller onto the fan,

343
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:11,791
it would stain the hair band, right?

344
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:16,591
The blood that splattered when you slashed Mr. Denkawa's neck

345
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:19,077
should also show up on your hair band.

346
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,081
Hearing those words,

347
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,691
as if the channel had suddenly changed,

348
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:28,091
Mr. Hyodo dropped his head

349
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,691
and started confessing what he had done.

350
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,191
Everything started

351
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,591
when Mr. Denkawa was finally unable to tolerate

352
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,391
Mr. Hyodo's phone that kept on ringing,

353
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,891
hence busted his door, barged into his room

354
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,491
and stopped the ringing.

355
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,891
Back then, Mr. Denkawa happened to find

356
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:49,591
a case filled with illegal drugs inside Mr. Hyodo's room.

357
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,109
It seemed that Mr. Hyodo

358
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,111
was a carrier for an illicit smuggling organization,

359
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,691
He was blackmailed by Mr. Denkawa who threatened to go to the police

360
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:59,791
unless Mr. Hyodo gave him half of his share.

361
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,491
Therefore, Mr. Hyodo made up his mind to commit homicide.

362
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:05,391
He got Mr. Denkawa drunk an hour before leaving

363
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,891
for the hot spring with the other two,

364
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:09,391
and killed him by slashing his neck.

365
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:13,131
After setting up the trick, he left the room and locked it.

366
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,291
He used sound from the TV to make it seem as if Mr. Denkawa was alive,

367
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,291
then left for the hot spring.

368
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,491
The alarm clock was set to ring

369
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:22,391
as soon as they came home from the hot spring.

370
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:24,791
So, in order to stop the bell of the alarm clock,

371
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,145
he busted down the door and went into the room.

372
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,891
Amidst the commotion of discovering the corpse,

373
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,691
he put the room key on the floor

374
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,891
and erased traces of the trick.

375
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:35,491
He had done exactly what I thought he did.

376
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:38,091
Well, at least for the sake of the landlady,

377
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:42,091
I'm glad that the fact that this man was an imposter wasn't disclosed.

378
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,691
Well, there's still one person who's not okay with that.

379
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,991
Hey, you!

380
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,691
What with you anyway, acting as dad's imposter?

381
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:57,891
I've already told you, haven't I?

382
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,891
The landlady's granddaughter who is my girlfriend asked me to do so.

383
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:04,591
That's a lie! Her granddaughter is married!

384
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:08,691
Thanks to Conan, it seems as if you have solved the case,

385
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,891
but you can't deceive me!

386
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:14,091
Well, like I said...

387
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:17,195
She was your teacher, right?

388
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:21,199
That landlady was your teacher in elementary school, right?

389
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,191
How... How did you know that?

390
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,891
Since the landlady who likes to take care of other people

391
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,207
wasn't helping her husband manage the apartment he owned

392
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,491
until 10 years ago,

393
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:35,213
she must have done some other jobs, right?

394
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:39,491
That's why I thought that the way she scolds people and her loud voice

395
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:42,491
might have had something to do with her job as a teacher before.

396
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,491
I see.

397
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,225
Teaching is a job in which you need to speak loudly.

398
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,991
Moreover, if she used to be a teacher,

399
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,691
she would've had to be able to play the piano, too.

400
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,491
I think if it was some time ago,

401
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:57,991
you could've remembered it like you do the keys of the piano.

402
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,891
I guess so.

403
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:03,241
Indeed, it seems like she used to play it.

404
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,243
But the determining factor was that

405
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:09,991
you unintentionally called the landlady "mother".

406
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:12,991
Oh, no. Hold it there, mother.

407
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:16,491
For elementary school children, a teacher is like a parent to them.

408
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:20,891
And at times, children call their teacher "mother".

409
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,891
You probably inadvertently called her that

410
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,391
because you were reminded of the old times, right?

411
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:28,591
Conan, how do you know something like that?

412
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:32,991
Shinichi told me that in the mail!

413
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,291
You discussed the case with Shinichi?

414
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,791
It's written that this guy was

415
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,591
her granddaughter's classmate in their junior high school days.

416
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,691
At the class reunion that was held three months ago,

417
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,691
he probably heard from her granddaughter that the landlady was in a fix

418
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:48,891
and decided to become Kogoro's imposter.

419
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,391
Yes. I just couldn't let her be.

420
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,293
Then, you could've just come right out

421
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,691
and say that you used to be her student, couldn't you?

422
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,299
She always told me not to lie,

423
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,301
so I found it hard to come out and say the truth at this point.

424
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,891
It's true that lying is not right.

425
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,307
But if you lied out of consideration for someone,

426
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,591
I'm sure that she will forgive you.

427
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:41,091
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Several days later,

428
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:44,291
we received a letter of gratitude with a photo from the landlady.

429
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,991
The contents of the letter went as follows.

430
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,791
"Your disciple that you introduced to me

431
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,291
is a very nice young man

432
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,991
and is helping me out in many ways."

433
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:55,991
I have no disciples, though.

434
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:58,791
He's lying again.

435
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,002
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,423
"Name"

437
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,360
Okay, we'll go catch beetles and stag beetles.

438
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,028
-Go for it. -Okay, I'll go get the culprit then!

439
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,429
Do your best.
