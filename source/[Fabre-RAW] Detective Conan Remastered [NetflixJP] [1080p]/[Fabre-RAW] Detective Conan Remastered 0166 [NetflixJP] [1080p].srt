1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,310
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,010
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,710
Today's setting is Trick Ridge.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,110
A spider's thread eerily tangles in the case.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,610
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,110
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,150
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 1)"

9
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,950
"Tottori Prefecture. Trick Ridge"

10
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,050
How strange.

11
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,550
I feel like we're going around in circles.

12
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,250
Hey, Heiji.

13
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,650
Could we be lost?

14
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,950
There hasn't been a person or car that's passed by.

15
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,150
I've forgotten my cellular phone,

16
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
and we can't call anyone

17
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,650
and to top it off, the bike is out of gas.

18
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,850
We should've caught a taxi after all.

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,950
Be quiet!

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,050
If it's the map of this area, just leave it to me.

21
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,050
Aren't you the one who forced your way

22
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,250
onto the back of my bike?

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,550
But, what're you going to do?

24
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,150
Didn't that letter say for us

25
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,750
to reach that Mr. Takeda's house by tonight?

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,250
That's right.

27
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,350
He doesn't write a phone number to contact

28
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,150
and he sends money along with a request

29
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,050
to check out a strange case.

30
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,050
I've have to return the money to that idiot.

31
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,050
Thought I'd solve that case while I'm at it.

32
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,350
The sun is setting.

33
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,350
Looks like we're going to have to camp out.

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,750
Camp out? I don't want to!

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,450
In a forest like this, without a tent or blankets!

36
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,950
It won't be funny if we catch a cold!

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,750
We can get through the night

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,450
if we wear a lot of the clothes we brought along

39
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,050
and sleep close together.

40
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,050
Sleep close together?

41
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,850
But, don't get any strange ideas.

42
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,550
That's my line!

43
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,250
Hey, hey. Don't start a fight.

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,150
Kazuha, let's go.

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,650
Pretend you didn't see it.

46
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,050
You're right.

47
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,150
Wait a minute.

48
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,150
It's just a joke. A joke!

49
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,250
My name is Robert Taylor. I'm American.

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,550
A cameraman who loves the nature of Japan!

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,250
I was just taking this beloved forest.

52
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,050
I haven't been here

53
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,950
since receiving Mr. Takeda's indebtedness.

54
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,250
Takeda? Do you know the house?

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,550
Yes. I was just about to go visit him.

56
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,850
Oh, so were we.

57
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,250
Then, will you show us the way?

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,450
Well, looks like I got overly taken in by the scenery and...

59
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,250
You wouldn't be lost, would you?

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,050
But, aren't you going to Mr. Takeda's house too?

61
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,550
Looks like it's a camp out after all.

62
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,750
No, I don't want to!

63
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,150
What can we do? Nobody's passing by.

64
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,550
Hey! Wait a minute!

65
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,250
I said to wait! Didn't I?

66
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,950
It stopped!

67
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,750
What do you think you're doing? Darn it!

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,550
Sorry, sorry, didn't think it'd hit you for real...

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,150
You're...

70
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,350
Oh, Hattori, it's you!

71
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,550
Which means...

72
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,050
I had a bad hunch something was going to happen.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,250
What's that?

74
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,250
You've received a request on the case

75
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
and you're on your way to Mr. Takeda's place too?

76
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,250
Yes.

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,550
But, mine is different from yours.

78
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,150
It's official.

79
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,250
The request came from

80
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,650
the present master of the Takeda household, Nobukazu Takeda!

81
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,050
And, I've already received a nice lump of $5,000

82
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,250
on the investigation fee.

83
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,350
Then, what is this request that came to me?

84
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,150
Is there another house by the name of Takeda around here?

85
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,550
Hey, let me have a look at that.

86
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,950
Sure.

87
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,350
Let's see.

88
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,050
"Next Saturday, please come to the Takeda home"

89
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,650
"at Trick Ridge before the sun sets."

90
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,250
"If you don't, another living doll"

91
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,250
"will probably become the victim of the spider."

92
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,650
Victim of the spider?

93
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,850
That's definitely about us.

94
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,950
Nasty things have been going on

95
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,950
and that's how the folks in this area call us.

96
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,550
The spider mansion of Trick Ridge.

97
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,950
If you don't want to be cursed,

98
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,150
stay away, that's what they say.

99
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,250
Trick Ridge?

100
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,050
Spider Mansion?

101
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,350
What? Misa passed away 3 years ago?

102
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,650
Why?

103
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,850
Two to three days after you left here,

104
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,450
she was found hanging on the second floor of the doll storehouse.

105
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,050
Was it a suicide?

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,350
Yes.

107
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,850
And soon after that, next was her sister.

108
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,050
Even Misa's mother was found hanging in the same place.

109
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,750
But why...

110
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,950
Well, I don't know.

111
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,950
And, that's not all.

112
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,250
There's still more?

113
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Yes, just the other day.

114
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,550
Negishi, whom brother was indebted to,

115
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,050
was found in the barn in the same way

116
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,050
while we were out, he quietly...

117
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,950
Did that person come in and out of here quite often?

118
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,050
Yes.

119
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,650
Brother is a doll master

120
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,350
and Mr. Negishi sold and transported the dolls.

121
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,050
It's about that Mr. Negishi's incident.

122
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,150
The mystery that my brother wants you to solve.

123
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,750
Dear.

124
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,850
I'm Ryuji Takeda, second son in this house.

125
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,350
You haven't got an accent, have you?

126
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,850
Yes, that's because we're always in Tokyo.

127
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,950
We came back on vacation,

128
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,950
but Mr. Negishi's incident came up,

129
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,550
and brother told us not to leave before the detective got here.

130
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,050
Detective Mouri.

131
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,050
I'm Nobukazu Takeda, the one who requested you.

132
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,150
Sorry to have you come all the way out here in the mountains.

133
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,750
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,650
And, Mr. Detective,

135
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,350
to be honest,

136
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,950
I think Mr. Negishi was killed by someone in this house.

137
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,450
That's the situation.

138
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,050
If you find out who the murderer is, only tell me who he is.

139
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,850
Are the four in the back your children?

140
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,150
If I'm not mistaken, I heard you had only two.

141
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,250
Oh, well, you see...

142
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,750
Nobukazu, it's been a while since we met.

143
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
Oh, Robert.

144
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,950
It's been a while.

145
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,250
Haven't seen you since summer vacation three years ago.

146
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,350
I came to see you to thank you, but...

147
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,350
Well, come in.

148
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,750
Your good friends, Sae and Emi have just come home too.

149
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,550
Oh, you're there.

150
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,950
Oh, Sae. Emi.

151
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,650
You've grown so big.

152
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,250
Murderer.

153
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
"Sae Takeda, Emi Takeda" -He came to kill again.

154
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,250
"Daughters of Ryuji and Yuko" -He sure has.

155
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,950
-It's frightening. -Frightening...

156
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,750
You two! What are you saying?

157
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,950
Mother is frightening too!

158
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,250
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,050
Oh, don't worry about it.

160
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,750
"Chie Takeda (71), Takeda brothers' mother"

161
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,750
Hey, mother,

162
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,050
why does Emi and I have only half a fish each?

163
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,350
Why?

164
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,450
I'm sorry. I only bought just enough fish

165
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,450
and so I was short two.

166
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,250
Please bear with it.

167
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,150
Then, have this.

168
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,150
What's the matter, Kazuha?

169
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,950
If you don't like fish, I'll take it.

170
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,750
Hey, you.

171
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,350
Delicious.

172
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,150
Huh? Where are you taking that?

173
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,550
"Miyuki Shioya (26), Housekeeper" -To grandmother.

174
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,250
Ever since the Negishi incident, she says it's a curse

175
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,850
and won't come out of her room, so I'm taking it to her.

176
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,050
Is that so?

177
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,150
All right!

178
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,050
I'd better get started in putting the finishing touches

179
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,650
to that unfinished doll!

180
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,150
Well then, Mr. Mouri.

181
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,150
Huh?

182
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,650
Please do a good job on that investigation from tomorrow.

183
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,450
Yes, sure!

184
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,650
Well then, relax and enjoy yourself.

185
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,750
Hey, Yuzo.

186
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,550
Don't you have to go and help brother?

187
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,850
Hold on to your horses.

188
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,050
I'll have this one last drink.

189
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,550
Can I borrow your car?

190
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,150
I'd like to go and visit Misa's grave.

191
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,550
At this hour?

192
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,850
Yes, if I go now,

193
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,950
the moon would be peeking over the mountain

194
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,650
on the way to the grave.

195
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,750
The moon over the mountain?

196
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,550
May I go along too?

197
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,550
Of course!

198
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,850
Hey, Ran. Would you like to go too?

199
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,350
Sure!

200
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,550
Sister Ran.

201
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,550
Conan want to go too?

202
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,250
Take this along with you.

203
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,250
You'd be in trouble if something happened.

204
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,750
-Here! -If something happened?

205
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,150
Take it along!

206
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,650
I don't know what it is,

207
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,650
but that kid is showing first-class jealousy!

208
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,650
Idiot! That's not it.

209
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,650
Well, then.

210
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,450
Then, dear.

211
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,150
We're going to take a bath first

212
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,050
so please watch the firewood.

213
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,650
Those two are suspicious, aren't they?

214
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,550
You're right.

215
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,250
Hey! Brother!

216
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,350
Brother!

217
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,850
Yuzo, what's the matter?

218
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,450
Brother isn't around! In the workshop or anywhere else!

219
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,250
-What? -What's that?

220
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,250
What about the barn?

221
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,450
Did you look in the storehouse?

222
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,150
I looked in both places, but he wasn't there.

223
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,450
How about the second floor of the storehouse?

224
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,850
No.

225
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,350
Something's wrong.

226
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,350
The second floor window of the storehouse is open.

227
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,450
Two people have committed suicide there

228
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,150
and no one wants to go close to that place, but...

229
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,250
The stairs are over there!

230
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,650
Hey.

231
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,250
It won't open! It's locked from inside!

232
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,650
Somebody, bring an axe or something!

233
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,150
Sure.

234
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,850
This is...

235
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,740
Brother.

236
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,140
That's right...

237
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,440
Hurry, call an ambulance!

238
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
Yes!

239
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
That's not what you need.

240
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,040
You've to call the police, not an ambulance.

241
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,940
He's already cold.

242
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,740
I'd say it's about an hour since he died.

243
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
-What? -What are you talking about?

244
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Don't come in!

245
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,540
This may be the site of a murder.

246
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,440
Murder?

247
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,040
I received a letter,

248
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,240
"A live doll will be"

249
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,240
"the victim of the spider here again tonight".

250
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,940
A letter that forecasted this murder!

251
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,640
"Again" means an incident has happened before.

252
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,740
That's why I came to stop the murder tonight

253
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,240
and to solve the mystery of the previous ones.

254
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,140
But, it was boldly done in front of me.

255
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,940
Who are you, anyway?

256
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,640
Heiji Hattori!

257
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,640
A pretty well-known detective in the Kansai area!

258
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,340
Detective?

259
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
I think I've heard about it.

260
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,440
The story of a really sharp young detective in the Osaka area.

261
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
Huh? But, is it all right?

262
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,640
That kid is in the room too.

263
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,340
Oh, never mind!

264
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,840
That kid is like my assistant.

265
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,040
A thumbtack?

266
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,640
The surface is rusty, but the needle is new.

267
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,040
Looks like it just came loose.

268
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,440
But, why is it here?

269
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,540
Anyway, please hurry and call the police.

270
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,140
Oh, yes.

271
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,740
But, if this is a murder,

272
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,740
how did the murderer get out from here?

273
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,940
It must be that small window.

274
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,840
He probably used a rope or something.

275
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,340
That's impossible.

276
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,640
That window is only big enough to barely let a child through.

277
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,240
-Huh? -What?

278
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,440
Wait a minute.

279
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,740
The door was locked from the inside,

280
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,940
so we broke the door down and came in.

281
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,040
And, if a person can't get out of that window...

282
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,840
Then, this is a murder in a sealed room.

283
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,940
It's Her Excellency.

284
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,840
The Spider Empress used her six long legs

285
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
to climb the storehouse wall and from the window,

286
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,840
she strangled Nobukazu with her thread.

287
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,340
She wanted to get even with Nobukazu

288
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,940
for building a storehouse here.

289
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,140
Frightening, frightening.

290
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,640
You're detectives. If you keep calling it a murder,

291
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,440
Her Excellency will curse you too.

292
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,740
What's the Spider Empress?

293
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,540
It's an ancient tale of this area.

294
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Long ago, at this ridge,

295
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,240
there was a woman as beautiful as an angel.

296
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,540
She stopped travelers who passed this ridge

297
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
and asked them riddles.

298
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,340
"Do you think there's a heaven?"

299
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,640
"Would you like to go there?"

300
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
All the travelers

301
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,240
were taken by the strange beauty of the woman

302
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,140
and replied, "yes".

303
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,540
They were taken deep into the forest and were never seen again.

304
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,640
A doll master heard of the rumor

305
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,140
and put a human-sized puppet

306
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,240
on the road of the ridge and watched.

307
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,440
As expected, the woman appeared and asked her riddle,

308
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,840
but the doll did not reply.

309
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,440
The woman became angry,

310
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,340
showing her true identity as a giant spider.

311
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,740
She attacked the puppet.

312
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,740
The doll master who was watching,

313
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,140
shot a fire arrow that he brought

314
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,640
and the giant spider who was engulfed in flames

315
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,040
escaped into the forest.

316
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,240
The doll master followed the spider

317
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,740
and found it burnt to death with her children in their nest.

318
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,340
After that, the village people who feared a curse

319
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
built a small shrine on that nest

320
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,440
calling it the "Spider Empress"

321
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,240
and, they came to call this ridge, "Trick Ridge".

322
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
It's just a fairy tale.

323
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,240
Why does there have to be a curse with that?

324
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,940
This storehouse stands where that shrine used to be.

325
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,440
The shrine was broken down?

326
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,740
Yes.

327
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,240
Father was a doll master and, after brother took after him,

328
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,540
he built this storehouse

329
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,340
against the wishes of the village people.

330
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,040
Three years after the storehouse was built,

331
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,740
Misa, brother's daughter and his wife, Kinuyo

332
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,040
was found having committed suicide.

333
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,340
The two were found pitifully tangled up in a spider's web.

334
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,340
And, again, three years later, the other day.

335
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,240
This time Mr. Negishi was found in the strings in the barn.

336
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,440
Strings?

337
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,640
They were tangled around Mr. Negishi's hands and legs.

338
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,940
Strings used for marionettes.

339
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,240
Just as brother was.

340
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,840
As if they were wrapped in a spider's threads.

341
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,240
I see.

342
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,540
That's why it's called the spider mansion of Trick Ridge.

343
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,740
Somebody's using that curse

344
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,940
to commit these murders.

345
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,440
Come to think of it, the area around the grave,

346
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,140
where Robert and the others went,

347
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,440
used to be the place where the Spider Empress appeared.

348
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,640
Could it be?

349
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,240
Making Ran take that cellular phone

350
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,140
was the right thing to do after all.

351
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,640
Darn, the house phone is in use.

352
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,140
Hey, Uncle!

353
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,640
Lend me your cellular phone! Hey!

354
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,440
-Uncle! -Here!

355
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,640
The cellular phone I borrowed!

356
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,540
Who are you going to call?

357
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,940
Kazuha...

358
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,540
You were back.

359
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,040
What's the matter? You're out of breath.

360
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,940
I told them that the place that you went to

361
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,740
had a mysterious past

362
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,940
and they turned pale and went flying out.

363
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,540
Oh, you were worried?

364
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,340
Idiot. That's not it.

365
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,140
It suddenly started raining, so we came back early.

366
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,140
A lot of landslides occur in this area.

367
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,240
Dear, what's all the noise about?

368
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,340
Well, actually...

369
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,740
Nobukazu has died?

370
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,940
On the second floor of that storehouse again?

371
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,440
Dear, is that really true?

372
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,040
Yes, and the door was locked.

373
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,240
And the police?

374
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,540
Miyuki is calling them now.

375
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,340
It's terrible!

376
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,140
There's been a landslide

377
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,840
and the police won't be here until tomorrow.

378
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
What?

379
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
Can't help it.

380
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,940
Robert, can I borrow your camera?

381
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,440
Sure.

382
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,940
What're you going to do with a camera?

383
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,140
What else? We're going to do the investigations.

384
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,540
We can't wait until daybreak.

385
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,040
Who's "we"?

386
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,740
Who else could there be?

387
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Me and this old man, right?

388
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,940
Then, everyone.

389
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,040
Until the police arrive tomorrow, please rest in your rooms!

390
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Please don't undertake any activity on your own!

391
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,440
That's strange.

392
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,740
What's the matter?

393
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,840
The mascot that was on my pouch is gone.

394
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,940
I thought I had it before I got in the car but...

395
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,540
Then, maybe it's in the car?

396
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,240
Then, I guess I'll have to go and find it tomorrow.

397
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,640
Do you want to go look for it now?

398
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,540
Yuzo has forgotten the car keys that he had lent to Robert

399
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,540
and I have a pen-light.

400
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,440
But, Father said not to leave the room.

401
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,740
It wouldn't hurt to just take a peek.

402
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,740
How is it? Is it there?

403
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,240
Nope, looks like not.

404
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,840
I probably dropped it in the mountain.

405
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,240
Darn it.

406
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,440
Maybe it was before you got in the car.

407
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,940
Remember, you dropped your pouch

408
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,040
and picked it up in a hurry!

409
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,440
It was probably then.

410
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,140
Was that mascot that important?

411
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,240
It was that Kudo who bought that mascot, wasn't it?

412
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,940
It's no good trying to hide it.

413
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,340
It's written all over your face.

414
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,640
Boy, I envy that guy Kudo.

415
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,840
You think about him so much,

416
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,740
and where has he gone?

417
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,340
If I were a man, I'd take you away from a cold guy like him!

418
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,940
I tell you, Shinichi isn't my guy.

419
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,940
And, he isn't cold.

420
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,240
He always seems to be looking over me.

421
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,840
Huh? Is he close by?

422
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,340
Nope. I just feel that way.

423
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,440
If I'm not mistaken, it was in this area.

424
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,940
Robert parked the car and we came running over.

425
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,140
Ryuji called out to us.

426
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,940
I dropped my pouch when I turned around.

427
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,740
Oh, no! I'm almost out of battery!

428
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,840
If it's batteries, there's some in my CD player.

429
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,540
I'll go get them.

430
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,340
She's really a nice girl.

431
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,640
Leaving a nice girl like that all alone...

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,440
That Kudo, where could he be roaming around?

433
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,840
What's this? This white ball.

434
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,640
It's come after all.

435
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,940
It sure has.

436
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,340
We saw it, didn't we?

437
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,540
We did. The spider's thread.

438
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,140
It's frightening, isn't it?

439
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,940
Frightening, frightening.

440
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,840
Hey, what's that sound?

441
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,940
It's the stairs.

442
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,140
Heavy feet. It's not Ran.

443
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,140
Who could it be?

444
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,340
Kazuha! Where are you?

445
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,640
Kazuha!

446
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,540
