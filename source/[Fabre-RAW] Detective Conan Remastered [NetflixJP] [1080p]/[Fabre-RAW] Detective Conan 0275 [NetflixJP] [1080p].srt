1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,670
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,470
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,970
At a creepy looking apartment

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,970
hiding an unexpected trick.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,170
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,410
We met a grandpa at Araide Clinic

9
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,010
and heard a bizarre ghost story from him.

10
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,110
Then we came to his small old apartment house

11
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,210
which he said was haunted.

12
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,210
Incidentally, there is a building next to his apartment house.

13
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,010
The builder had committed suicide

14
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,410
after the bursting of the financial bubble.

15
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,910
There is a park in front of his apartment house too,

16
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,510
where the burned body of a young woman was previously found.

17
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,910
This place has many eerie stories surrounding it,

18
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,410
and we fell asleep while waiting in grandfather's room

19
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,310
for the ghost to appear.

20
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,310
Go home.

21
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,710
Go home.

22
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,310
Get out...

23
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,310
immediately!

24
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,810
And...

25
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,510
The toilet water turned red.

26
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,810
A spooky figure looks in through the window from outside.

27
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,110
Also, there is a death candle floating

28
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,310
spotted in the building next door.

29
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,610
What does this mean anyhow?

30
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,910
The ghost appearing on the TV screen after suddenly going fainted,

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,610
the toilet water suddenly turning red...

32
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,310
Both can be explained scientifically

33
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,710
but what about the other two phenomenon,

34
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,310
the death candle and the figure in the window?

35
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,510
I just can't seem to figure them out.

36
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,510
How did the culprit do them?

37
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,810
Was there a culprit in the first place?

38
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,010
If one did exist, who could it be?

39
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,210
And for what purpose is the culprit doing all this for?

40
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,310
"Truth of the Haunted House (Part 2)"

41
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,510
Conan.

42
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,010
What're you looking at with the window open?

43
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,010
The bugs will come flying in again.

44
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,210
Well, I'm wondering just about where

45
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,510
that gramps saw the death candle in that building.

46
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,810
The spot where I saw it

47
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,410
is in the darkness around the center of that building.

48
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,810
The red light alone was looming and moving about in the air.

49
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,010
At times it turned a bluish white light.

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,610
If you don't believe me,

51
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,910
go ask Mr. Yotsuya of Room 2 and Mr. Bancho of Room 4.

52
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,910
Each of them said that they once also saw the death candle.

53
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,010
Oh, yeah, I saw...

54
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,810
A red one and blue death candle as well,

55
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,510
when I visited the room where my senior at school was living.

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,510
Your senior?

57
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,510
Yeah.

58
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,010
Just up there. It's the room right above this one.

59
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,010
Room 6 is where my senior was living.

60
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,410
But since then,

61
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,410
he was unable to sleep properly

62
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,010
because he was seized with fear of the death candles.

63
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,510
He finally moved out.

64
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,910
I was unable to sleep either,

65
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,410
not because of fright, but rather, because of being overexcited.

66
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,410
Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,510
Hey, this is a 8mm movie projector, right?

68
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,510
Yeah.

69
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,810
I'm now using it to edit a movie filmed by our film club in college.

70
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,410
But this room is bloody awful,

71
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,110
full of sick horror magazines and posters.

72
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,210
It's really scary.

73
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,510
I feel I'm going to have nightmares just being here.

74
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,810
Still, all this is nothing compared to Room 4

75
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,910
where Mr. Bancho lives.

76
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,110
What?

77
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,910
"Room 4, Bancho"

78
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,610
This room is really something.

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,410
There're tons of the ghost and monster figures here!

80
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,610
"Kikuji Bancho (34)" -You haven't seen anything yet.

81
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,210
I turn the light off like so.

82
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,410
The figures are glowing various colors in the dark!

83
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,910
It's because of this black light.

84
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,010
The special kind of fluorescent coating painted on the figures

85
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,410
reacts to black light making them glow like a neon tube.

86
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,910
You know a lot, sonny.

87
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,810
A toy store owner told me about it.

88
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,510
By the way, you also saw the death candle, right?

89
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,510
Yeah, I did,

90
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,810
but I saw it through that window,

91
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,810
not the window facing that building.

92
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,510
This window...

93
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,610
is located diagonally below the window where the figure appeared.

94
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,010
Hey, kid.

95
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,110
I think you better close the window now.

96
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,710
Do it for your sister's sake.

97
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,010
But, in fact, a couple of moths have already entered.

98
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,310
If you don't believe the ghost story I told you,

99
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,010
you better go talk with Botan of Room 1!

100
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,210
That square grad student with a square head!

101
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,010
Yeah. I've never seen it before.

102
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,610
I believe nothing but what I can comprehend scientifically.

103
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,210
"Tsuyuhiko Botan (27)" -But you know what I hate more than that now?

104
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,810
That building opposite here that is still half done.

105
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,210
Which means?

106
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,410
Look at these.

107
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,410
That building shuts out the sunlight,

108
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,310
so the sun rarely shines into the room.

109
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,010
That's certainly true.

110
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,510
Mr. Otonashi's room diagonally above is much better than mine.

111
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,010
Because it has a window facing the street side.

112
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,710
So, why don't you move out?

113
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,410
Because the rent is so cheap

114
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,610
and my grandma told me that this place had good feng shui.

115
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,710
Did you say you believe only what you can comprehend scientifically?

116
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,610
Excuse me.

117
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,310
May I smoke here?

118
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,010
Oh, sure, please.

119
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,310
But please leave after you finish smoking the cigarette!

120
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,410
Sure.

121
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,510
Cigarette?

122
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,510
Dad, your arm!

123
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,910
A moth again!

124
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,310
Darn! Why always me?

125
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,210
Get them out of the room quickly! Now!

126
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,510
That's what I'm trying to do now!

127
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,110
I see.

128
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,410
The culprits were afraid

129
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,910
that the murder they committed would be revealed.

130
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,310
So they tried to destroy the decisive evidence

131
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,010
of the woman that they burned to death 4 years ago.

132
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,610
They used ghosts to cover up the evil doing.

133
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,810
What?

134
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,410
Are you leaving already?

135
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,710
The night's still young.

136
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,810
You may be missing out on seeing

137
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,410
one of the eeriest ghosts you've ever seen before.

138
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,310
Too bad you're leaving.

139
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,610
Well, it's perfectly all right with me if you leave now.

140
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,810
That way I can get on with my paper.

141
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,510
Okay, buddy, take it easy, say hello to the ghost for me.

142
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,410
How unsociable they are.

143
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,610
Haunted by the ghost, my eye?

144
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,410
Making such a big fuss over illusion.

145
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,410
Where is Conan?

146
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,110
There he is.

147
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,610
Hey! We're going home now!

148
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,710
I've got to go pee,

149
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,510
but I'm a bit scared to go alone.

150
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,810
Hey, pops, please go with me?

151
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,810
Oh, man.

152
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,410
Come on, why should I?

153
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,710
All right, all right.

154
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,510
I'll be waiting outside then.

155
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,910
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

156
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,310
Who's there?

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,010
Sonny.

158
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,610
I thought you went home.

159
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,010
We've got trouble.

160
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,210
Trouble?

161
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,810
Look. That restroom is cursed. No doubt about it.

162
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,010
It's so stinky and I can't flush the toilet.

163
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,110
It sure smells, but...

164
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,110
There seems no problem with flushing.

165
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,710
Water is...

166
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,910
Water is turning red...

167
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,210
That...

168
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,710
That can't be true.

169
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,010
Oh, boy. Now, the TV in your room is cursed.

170
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,910
-What? -Look, over there.

171
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,710
Go home. Go home.

172
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,110
The ghost! That's the ghost! What should we do?

173
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,410
-Get out immediately! -This can't be happening...

174
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,210
-Go home. -This can't be happening...

175
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,610
What're you doing?

176
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,110
There is no tape inside.

177
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,010
Who is it?

178
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,910
Who the heck is doing this?

179
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
What?

180
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,360
So it appeared again. The ghost.

181
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
No, no way.

182
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
There must be something wrong here.

183
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,860
Because everything was...

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,460
Yeah.

185
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,760
They were all tricks to make it look like the works of the ghost.

186
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
You're saying that nobody but you

187
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,660
could have set the tricks up because you created them,

188
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,960
isn't that right, Mr. Bancho?

189
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Tricks! How can you say that?

190
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,860
Man, you're acting like a detective or something...

191
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,160
Detective?

192
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
Don't tell me you are the renowned detective, "Sleeping Kogoro."

193
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,660
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,960
Now I'm going to unlock

195
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,460
the mysteries of a lot of psychic phenomena.

196
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,060
First of all, about the toilet water turning red.

197
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,560
What I noticed about it was that, when I entered the restroom,

198
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,460
it smelled awfully of ammonia,

199
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,060
and that the toilet tank smelled faintly of alcohol.

200
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,360
Ammonia and alcohol?

201
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Perhaps you did an experiment in science in

202
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,060
your elementary school days, remember?

203
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,160
When you add one drop of alkaline ammonia water

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,560
to the colorless phenolphthalein solution dissolved in alcohol,

205
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,360
the red color will appear like magic.

206
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Yeah, but I wonder if it would work out that well?

207
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,960
The color in the experiment isn't bright red but pinkish red.

208
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,860
The color could never be mistaken.

209
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
Yeah, true.

210
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,060
But it would look like blood in a dimly-lit restroom like here.

211
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,560
Well, even so, there is no chemical reaction with urine

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,060
because ammonia in our urine is acid or neutral,

213
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,260
not alkaline.

214
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Yes, that's why he needed...

215
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
This ammonia liquid.

216
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
It's...

217
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,360
This is poured into the water in the toilet bowl

218
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
then phenolphthalein is poured into the water in the toilet tank.

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,460
Then chemical reaction will occur

220
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,360
and nobody would suspect the strong smell of ammonia,

221
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,260
seeing this dirty restroom.

222
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,160
Exactly.

223
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,760
But, where did you get that chemical, sonny?

224
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,960
Pops asked me to look for it.

225
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,660
So when you were saying goodbye at the entrance,

226
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,560
I slipped into the room and found it...

227
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
in this room, Mr. Bancho.

228
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,760
I also found other interesting things

229
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,060
like phenolphthalein and chloroform.

230
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,060
And even a video tape of a scary movie.

231
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,960
A scary movie video tape?

232
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,060
Yeah!

233
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,160
The tape with a ghost woman saying, "Go home, go home.".

234
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,460
Hey...

235
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,260
Don't tell me that...

236
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:59,060
Yes. The ghost that my daughter, Ran saw on the TV screen...

237
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,260
are the pictures Mr. Bancho transmitted from the VCR in his room.

238
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
He sent the pictures! How?

239
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,860
It's simple and easy

240
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,260
if you use the public antenna of this building.

241
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,760
Plug the antenna cord into the output terminal of the VCR in his room

242
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,360
and transmit video pictures to the antenna.

243
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,260
Then the antenna sends the pictures to the TV

244
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,260
in Mr. Otonashi's room.

245
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,260
But, in order to do that,

246
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,160
you have to be able to set the TV channel

247
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
to the appropriate channel to receive the pictures.

248
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,960
And you must turn on the TV first, how do you think...

249
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,860
It's a multi channel remote control.

250
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,660
Mr. Otonashi.

251
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Once you enter your TV or VCR's manufacturer name into the device,

252
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,260
you can operate any TV or VCR made by the manufacturer.

253
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,860
So you can operate the TV in someone else's room on

254
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,660
without the owner realizing a thing.

255
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,260
Well, after finding out how the trick worked,

256
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,960
it was a piece of cake even for me.

257
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
Don't tell me.

258
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,360
This old man was the one who sent the images

259
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,260
to my TV screen a while ago.

260
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,960
Yeah, I got him to help me send the video I just "borrowed" from you.

261
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,360
You used the remote control

262
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,960
from outside the window of Mr. Othonashi's room,

263
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,060
facing the building under construction.

264
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,460
Using the wall as a foothold,

265
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,760
you could easily send the signals to his TV set from there.

266
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,160
You didn't even need to watch the TV screen

267
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,060
as you can listen to the sound and set the channel.

268
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,960
And while the sun was still up,

269
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,460
you poured the chloroform onto the windowsill

270
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,860
so that all of us who were in the room would fall asleep.

271
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,360
You thought you could make

272
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,860
one of us who suddenly fainted

273
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,860
and got up in the dark room, still hazy in the head

274
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,760
see an eerie illusion. Isn't that right?

275
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,960
I see.

276
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,760
But, that was for real, wasn't it?

277
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,860
I mean the figure of a person that has been looking this way.

278
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,460
Oh, that's not a figure of a person at all!

279
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,960
-What? -Go over and look closer,

280
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,660
you'll see what it is.

281
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,760
This is a...

282
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,060
moth!

283
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,160
Moths gathered in large numbers.

284
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,660
Or, to put it more precisely,

285
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,060
it's an aggregate of male moths.

286
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,660
He coated the screen in a human shape

287
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,160
with female moth pheromone,

288
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,860
that is also used as an insecticide,

289
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,160
and stuck eyes and a mouth made from black paper on it.

290
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,260
The male moths that were attracted to the scent of the pheromone,

291
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,960
clustered on it to make it look like a human shadow

292
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,260
was looking inside through the window.

293
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,260
In fact, moths kept approaching my arm several times.

294
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,660
When I almost fell from the window

295
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,460
where I saw the figure for the first time,

296
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,260
I found myself grabbing the screen,

297
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,060
and got the pheromone on my arm, which attracted moths to me.

298
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,260
So, that is...

299
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,760
I simply removed the screen on the second floor

300
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,860
and placed it by window on the first floor. That's all.

301
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,160
Incidentally, the reason why the figure started disappearing on its own

302
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,660
is because Mr. Bancho's black light that was activated by a timer

303
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,060
was emitted from the window of his room diagonally below.

304
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,860
Moths are more prone to be attracted

305
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,960
by ultraviolet light emitted by the black lights, than the pheromone.

306
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,960
But the trick would be disclosed if even one moth remains.

307
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,260
That's why Mr. Bancho hurried across to the window,

308
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,760
as soon as the moths began to fly out,

309
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
then opened the window and screen together.

310
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,460
The force of the impact knocked the moths off the screen completely.

311
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,360
Mr. Bancho, you pretended not to notice the moths

312
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,860
even when you got close to the window, right?

313
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,560
That's because you intentionally caused this uproar over the ghost!

314
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,760
But, I still don't understand.

315
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,360
All the chemicals besides the chloroform can be gotten easily, but why...

316
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
Right.

317
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,860
Mr. Bancho could've easily made the video himself,

318
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,960
by using his scary figures and his falsetto...

319
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,460
Why'd he go through the trouble of making up a ghost story?

320
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,160
He attempted to scare us, Mr. Otonashi's guests,

321
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
to get Mr. Otonashi who refused to move out of here

322
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,660
to decide to do so after all this ghost scare.

323
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,260
Perhaps, in order to cover up the crime four years ago.

324
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
The crime four years ago?

325
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
You mean the murder of the woman burned to death

326
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
in the park right before us?

327
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,560
You say you saw the death candle in that building under construction?

328
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,460
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
What was drifting in the air wasn't the death candle,

330
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,260
but a lit cigarette.

331
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,060
What was glowing bluish white

332
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,760
was the light of portable TV that was secretly being watched.

333
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,460
Don't tell me there's someone in that building?

334
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,660
Yeah, taking advantage of the fact

335
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,160
that the building is still under construction,

336
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,060
he's been living in hiding there.

337
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,260
He is one of the two murderers

338
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,860
who was witnessed four years ago,

339
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,460
that has a scar across his cheek.

340
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,060
Perhaps, Mr. Bancho is one of the two murderers,

341
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,860
whose face wasn't witnessed.

342
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
As the light of the cigarette was witnessed

343
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,560
and the fact that somebody lived here was about to be disclosed,

344
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,760
you fabricated and accelerated the plot about the ghost girl,

345
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,360
you chased the residents of the second floor of this apartment out

346
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,560
one after the other, because they were the only people

347
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,460
who could look inside the building from their room!

348
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,960
If he had been caught,

349
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,460
he would have name his accomplice from four years ago

350
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,060
and you would have gone to prison.

351
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
The reason that you're living here

352
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,760
is to bring the guy with the scar across his cheek, his food and drinks,

353
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,160
because his scar will give him away.

354
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,460
I guess you were planning to sneak out

355
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,960
after things settled down a bit, but too late now.

356
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,860
See, you can hear it, can't you?

357
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,560
The footsteps of doom.

358
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,060
The siren of the police car that I called.

359
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,960
Darn it!

360
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,460
Out of the way, move!

361
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,260
Wait...

362
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,360
Ran, don't get pass you!

363
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
What?

364
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,160
Out of my way, lady

365
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,860
or I'll curse you to death!

366
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,060
Just what did you say?

367
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,660
If you're not a ghost, you don't scare me at all!

368
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,060
Back fist.

369
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,560
The police arrived there soon after.

370
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,360
The host of this haunted house

371
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,260
and the "death candle" man hiding in the building were arrested.

372
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,560
The case of the haunted house scare

373
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,160
together with the murder case that occurred four years ago,

374
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,560
came to a close.

375
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Incidentally, the murder four years ago was committed

376
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,560
because of money trouble.

377
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,660
What a worldly case over money behind an unworldly ghost case.

378
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,460
So, all those ghosts were tricks after all.

379
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah. I don't give a hoot about them anymore.

380
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,160
They don't exist.

381
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,360
What's wrong, Sonoko?

382
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,360
Hey, Sonoko.

383
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,260
Are you crying? Why?

384
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Because...

385
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
Because with you talking like that,

386
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,960
I can't show my true self, can I?

387
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,560
No!

388
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,960
I give myself credit for this perfect makeup!

389
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,060
Ran's boogey phobia is one of her charm points

390
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,660
so it's a waste to cure it.

391
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,360
-Don't you think so? -Yeah.

392
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,760
I think you should do something about your personality first.

393
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,100
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,160
