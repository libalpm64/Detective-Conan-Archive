1
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,273
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,973
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,673
A smile-less angel is the client.

4
00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:12,173
The Youth Detective Squad go into a mansion

5
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:13,873
and find themselves in a bizarre labyrinth.

6
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:15,373
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:17,073
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,073
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:10,924
Hey.

10
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:13,524
Look at this lonely girl.

11
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:18,624
Hey, Conan! Come over here! Right now!

12
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:22,024
We got a client for the Youth Detective Squad!

13
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,724
Just come, we got a nice one.

14
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,924
Hey, she's really cute, isn't she?

15
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,124
She gives me high motivation, man.

16
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:35,424
Yeah.

17
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:47,824
"Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 1)"

18
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:51,224
One day, this man named "Clock" came to me.

19
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:54,124
Clock, you mean, that clock?

20
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,024
Yes.

21
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:58,124
He doesn't have either a first or last name.

22
00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:00,024
Just "Clock".

23
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,324
He is your mother's grandfather,

24
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:04,624
and your great-grandfather.

25
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:07,024
He name is Gozo Isegawa.

26
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:08,924
My great-grandfather.

27
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,824
I didn't know I had a great-grandfather.

28
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:16,024
With his resilience, he dominated the Japanese stock market after the war.

29
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,024
He was a legendary market player

30
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:21,224
who achieved numerous wealth in one generation.

31
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:22,824
People called him "Raging Bull".

32
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,824
However unfortunately,

33
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,424
last winter...

34
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:34,424
Clock.

35
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:35,624
Yes.

36
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:43,224
Master.

37
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,824
I, the Raging Bull, shall give my entire fortune

38
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:50,024
to whoever solves this riddle.

39
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:53,824
However, the time limit is 24 hours.

40
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,424
Once the time is over,

41
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:59,724
one will lose the right of both inheritance and challenge forever.

42
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:03,024
The challengers will be restricted to my sons, wife,

43
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:06,424
and grandchildren, with the ones with closer blood relationship first.

44
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:10,224
And I want you to see it through.

45
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,724
Please, you're not dying, Master.

46
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:17,824
In the end, nobody ever visited me.

47
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,324
Well, one gets what one deserves,

48
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:22,724
I know that, but still, dying alone is a lonely thing.

49
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:24,924
What the heck is my family for?

50
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:28,424
Please, calm down. You should completely rest.

51
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:31,824
The Raging Bull was a miserable cow, after all.

52
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:47,324
So, that was my great-grandfather's end.

53
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:48,324
And...

54
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,824
As the secretary and executor of Mr. Gozo Isegawa,

55
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,424
I'm here to tell you something.

56
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:55,024
Ms. Yuriko Matsunaka.

57
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:56,624
Ah, yes.

58
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:59,224
You are the one with the 17th right of inheritance.

59
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,924
Now it is your turn.

60
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,924
Me?

61
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,824
Of course you have the right to abstain.

62
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,224
It is up to you.

63
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:12,024
By the way, I have heard that the Youth Detective Squad,

64
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:15,824
the smart kids, are at the same school as yours.

65
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,324
That's why you asked us?

66
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:22,624
So he is actually trying not only Yuriko,

67
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,924
but us to solve the riddle.

68
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,324
What does your family say about that?

69
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:31,724
My father died in a car accident right after I was born.

70
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,724
So as my mother with a sickness last year.

71
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,724
So I'm the only one left.

72
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,424
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,924
All my relatives disagreed with my parents' marriage.

74
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:45,424
So they eloped and got married.

75
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:49,624
So I really don't know my relatives

76
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,024
and you are the only people I could talk to.

77
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:55,324
Okay. How do you feel about it now?

78
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,824
I kind of afraid.

79
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,524
But if I challenge to solve the riddle,

80
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:00,824
I can see the house that my mother

81
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:03,524
and great-grandfather once lived together when she was young.

82
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:04,624
Mr. Clock told me that.

83
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:09,524
That house is called the Angel's Mansion.

84
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:12,824
Ms. Yuriko and the Youth Detective Squad.

85
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:14,324
Mr. Clock!

86
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:15,524
He's the man.

87
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,524
Pleasure to meet you all.

88
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:22,724
It's pretty far, isn't it?

89
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,624
That Angel's Mansion.

90
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:28,524
It's not far once we get out of this forest.

91
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:36,324
Oh, yes. I told your parents

92
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,124
that you were going to be camping tonight,

93
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:41,024
and I have already got permission from them.

94
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,124
-What? -What?

95
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:45,024
So you've done a research on us already.

96
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,224
It's there. Look.

97
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:02,624
That's the South Angel.

98
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,724
That's the West Angel.

99
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,024
That's the East Angel.

100
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:09,924
And that's the North Angel.

101
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:11,524
They are named this way

102
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:14,624
since they are located in the four cardinal points precisely.

103
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:15,724
And also...

104
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,124
I've heard that the statues' faces

105
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:20,924
are made to look like Mr. Isegawa's wife, who happened to die young.

106
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,324
My great-grandmother?

107
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:29,524
Yes. He spent all of his earnings just to see his wife's face again.

108
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:33,424
Probably he looked like a cold father to his little sons.

109
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:36,824
They left the house as soon as they became adults.

110
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,324
In the end, he was the only one left in the house.

111
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:42,924
Sure, his sons visited him sometimes,

112
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:45,624
but always ended up with a big fight.

113
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:50,624
It was very sad that the people couldn't understand him well.

114
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:59,624
"South Mansion" -See the house with the South Angel?

115
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:01,924
We call it the South Mansion.

116
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,224
That's where Mr. Isegawa spent his last moment.

117
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,624
And the East Mansion over there,

118
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:09,324
"East Mansion" -was mainly his workplace.

119
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,924
"North Mansion" -And that North Mansion,

120
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,424
was where his sons and housekeepers used to live.

121
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:17,924
No one lives there now but it still looks pretty neat.

122
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:20,924
I'm trying to keep it clean all the time.

123
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:22,424
What about that one though?

124
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:25,424
The East Mansion is like a haunted house.

125
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:27,524
"East Mansion" -Actually it is Mr. Isegawa's will that

126
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:30,624
nobody goes in there, so...

127
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,724
Why?

128
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,224
I have no idea.

129
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,624
What is that?

130
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:38,824
Oh, that's Minotaur?

131
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,424
Minotaur?

132
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:44,924
It's an imaginary monster, half human and half bull.

133
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,624
You're really knowledgable.

134
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:49,724
He had been called "Raging Bull".

135
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:52,524
What else could decorate this house better?

136
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:58,624
Oh, yeah. There are bull everywhere!

137
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:02,224
In the stock market, the bull is a symbol of power.

138
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,024
You can find statues of bulls in Wall Street, New York,

139
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:06,724
which is the center of the stock market.

140
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:10,224
Bulls are like guardian angels for market players.

141
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:14,024
What's that?

142
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:17,324
It's one of the security systems Mr. Isegawa left.

143
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,824
It starts up automatically when the sun sets.

144
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:30,224
Even after Mr. Isegawa passed away?

145
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:35,024
Right. Until somebody solves his riddle and finds the treasures.

146
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,624
The security is going to be on.

147
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,724
And so am I.

148
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:40,624
The angel is scary.

149
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,624
It's an Angel's mansion under the daylight

150
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:48,824
and a witch's mansion under the moonlight, I guess.

151
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:51,624
There are two faces.

152
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:59,324
"Mansion of the Raging Bull"

153
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:03,424
Don't worry! I'm with you!

154
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:05,624
Me too! Kind of.

155
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,924
Here is the fifth mansion, the "Mansion of the Raging Bull".

156
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:11,924
We are at the center of Mr. Isegawa's property.

157
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:15,524
So my mother was living in this house, right?

158
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:18,124
After your parents left the mansion,

159
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:20,024
Mr. Isegawa was always worried about them,

160
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:23,024
so he would always visit this place alone.

161
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:25,224
Hey, Mr. Clock.

162
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,124
I think it's time for you to tell us

163
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:30,324
about the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

164
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:34,024
Right. That's what we're here for.

165
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:37,624
I'm sorry but it's not time yet, so please.

166
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:42,024
I guess time really matters in this riddle, doesn't it?

167
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:48,524
Well, it's time for me to serve you dinner.

168
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,624
To the North Mansion, please.

169
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:53,424
"North Mansion"

170
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,424
I'm stuffed!

171
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:05,024
Yeah, it was delicious.

172
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:10,624
Now it's time.

173
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:14,324
Here is the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

174
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:15,424
-What? -What?

175
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:23,224
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

176
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,424
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

177
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:29,824
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

178
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,424
That's all?

179
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,124
Yes.

180
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:36,524
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

181
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:39,424
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

182
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:41,224
And...

183
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:44,724
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

184
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,024
24 hours from now.

185
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:49,824
So the time limit is 9 pm tomorrow.

186
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,524
More important is, which bull he's talking about?

187
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,924
Now, please, be careful.

188
00:11:58,924 --> 00:12:04,124
Some of the security systems are actually quite dangerous.

189
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,224
I've seen the previous challengers getting severely injured.

190
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:09,724
Some of them have never returned.

191
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:20,024
Keep in mind, this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

192
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,151
That must be it.

193
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:33,051
That humongous bull gotta be the one, man!

194
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,251
Yeah, it could be.

195
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,451
But shouldn't we go with everybody else?

196
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:41,051
Hey, you'll never beat Conan if you're like that.

197
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,151
That bull's gotta be the one in Gozo's riddle!

198
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:46,251
But, Genta...

199
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:52,051
That bull looks to be raging, you know.

200
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:55,051
I'm gonna find the treasure map inside its horn, and then...

201
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:59,051
Genta, you're amazing!

202
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:01,951
Yuriko.

203
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,251
I don't think it's that simple.

204
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,851
"Mansion of the Raging Bull" -We should go with the boys.

205
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,551
It's dangerous.

206
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:08,951
Yeah, but did you see Yuriko's face?

207
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,351
She didn't show a smile, not even once.

208
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,051
She's really sad.

209
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:15,451
I want to solve this riddle her great-grandfather left her,

210
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:17,151
so she can smile again.

211
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:20,051
All right, then how come you are not checking this bull?

212
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:22,051
Because I'm scared.

213
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:28,151
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head."

214
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,551
"When the bull's horn disappears..."

215
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,451
It disappeared!

216
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:35,351
What?

217
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,551
Ai, you're fantastic!

218
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,751
I get it! It must be the West Angel

219
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,551
that's coming down, isn't it?

220
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:53,851
Ayumi and Ai are saying that the West Angel is the one.

221
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,451
We need to be the director to our original goals.

222
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:58,751
Director?

223
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,751
Director from where?

224
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,451
You don't know?

225
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,151
It means to achieve the original intentions.

226
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,451
It should be carry out through to our original goals, Genta.

227
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,951
But as a matter of fact,

228
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:16,151
I smell something fishy from the East Mansion.

229
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:21,651
It is Mr. Isegawa's will that nobody goes in there, so...

230
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,751
Maybe the riddle is a lie

231
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,751
and the treasures are in the East Mansion?

232
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,751
Genta.

233
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:38,351
"East Mansion"

234
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,951
Thank you, Mitsuhiko.

235
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:51,251
No problem.

236
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:02,051
What is this thing?

237
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:06,751
"West Angel"

238
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:08,251
Hey.

239
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,851
Ai.

240
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:13,751
How should we make the angel come down?

241
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:16,951
That is what we are trying to find out.

242
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,151
Watch out!

243
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,051
Electric shock.

244
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:27,251
Ai?

245
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:29,551
I guess we better go back.

246
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,851
AS I expected, it is at the East Mansion.

247
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:39,751
The treasures is somewhere in here.

248
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:45,751
This bull has no horns!

249
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,451
"When the bull's horn disappears"...

250
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,951
"The tail becomes the head".

251
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,451
The tail is the head...

252
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:57,651
Head?

253
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,451
Why aren't you moving?

254
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:14,051
You! Cow!

255
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:18,851
Oh, my God!

256
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,551
Help!

257
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:22,251
Somebody help!

258
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,551
Hello, anybody?

259
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:40,251
Is anybody here?

260
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:55,951
Mitsuhiko!

261
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,551
Mr. Clock. Genta!

262
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,751
You have to believe this.

263
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,951
I found human bones in there.

264
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,551
Bones?

265
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:05,851
Is that true?

266
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:08,951
I guess that's how rats end up in this labyrinth.

267
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:11,951
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to call the police?

268
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,451
Certainly, I will.

269
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,851
Now you, focus on what you have to do. Time is money.

270
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:22,551
"North Mansion"

271
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:25,851
Where's everyone?

272
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:27,551
They said they're going to the washroom.

273
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,551
It's been too long.

274
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,351
Yuriko?

275
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,551
I can't sleep.

276
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,651
So I'm gonna go for a little walk, okay?

277
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:41,451
But...

278
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,751
Don't worry. Just for a while.

279
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,751
In the end, nobody ever visited me.

280
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:56,251
Dying alone is a lonely thing.

281
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,551
Where is this?

282
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,851
Conan?

283
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,551
Oh! I'm going to pee in my pants!

284
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,251
Mr. Clock, where's the washroom?

285
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:21,251
Come here!

286
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:38,451
I don't know if we should trust what Mr. Clock told us.

287
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,251
What do you mean?

288
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:43,351
You know, this Gozo guy left the riddle,

289
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:47,051
Yuriko was the 17th challenger. Things like that.

290
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,551
That's make sense.

291
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:52,751
There have been 16 challengers in the past few months,

292
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,151
but nobody left a memo or whatsoever.

293
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,451
It is strange.

294
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,951
Yeah. Maybe this "riddle" thing is a lie

295
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:04,951
and is something he used to get Yuriko to come here.

296
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,951
Getting her to come here and then what?

297
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,251
Yeah.

298
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:12,051
Actually, I don't know.

299
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,651
I don't think Mr. Clock was lying.

300
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,451
Just my guess.

301
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,251
That's one sure thing.

302
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:22,151
Even if the previous challengers left some kind of hint to the riddle,

303
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:25,151
that Clock guy could've cleaned them all up.

304
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:28,051
For the sake of being fair to all the challengers?

305
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,251
Yeah.

306
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,551
But the thing is what does he gain from doing so?

307
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,251
Shoots! 10 hours left.

308
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,551
I'm so sorry.

309
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,651
For causing you a trouble. Maybe I should just...

310
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:53,151
Don't you worry, Yuriko.

311
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,851
There're still many other bulls to see!

312
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,151
We got 10 hours.

313
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:01,651
It's long enough for me to break all the horns!

314
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,851
Wait a minute. Why is it the Bull?

315
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,351
And why does it have to be the horn?

316
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:14,051
Simple. Yuriko's great-granddad was called "Raging Bull".

317
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:16,251
And, there's a bull with horns,

318
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,351
which Genta got hanged on last night

319
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,451
in the Mansion of the Raging Bull.

320
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,151
And there's a gold bull with no horns in the East Mansion,

321
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:26,351
where Mitsuhiko pissed in his pants, right?

322
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,651
What are you talking about?

323
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,751
I didn't pee in my pants!

324
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,551
The "bull" in riddle does not refer

325
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,451
to any of the bulls in this mansion. That is...

326
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,451
"Bull" -A kanji character?

327
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:44,351
"The bull's horn disappears", that means...

328
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:45,851
"Noon"

329
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:47,451
Sheep?

330
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,351
Oh, please, Genta!

331
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,751
It's "Go". Like when you write "noon" in Japanese.

332
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,951
In the Chinese zodiac, it means "horse".

333
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,751
Horse? There's no horse in here.

334
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,451
It's not just animal.

335
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,051
This "horse" also indicates a direction.

336
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,951
And one more thing.

337
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,151
Shoots!

338
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:08,751
"South Angel"

339
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,451
The South Angel.

340
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:12,451
Horse is the symbol of the south.

341
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:15,251
You have to be careful. There's an electric shock security system.

342
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:18,251
No, there's no electric shock if I'm right.

343
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:21,851
Because the character of "horse" also means 12 pm.

344
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:24,451
Like the word "Go" that means noon.

345
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,251
It's opened!

346
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:49,151
It's weird. It's glued onto the floor.

347
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,451
Why?

348
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:59,451
Is that the Raging Bull's treasure?

349
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,651
No, this black crystal is the key to solve the next riddle.

350
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:06,751
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head"

351
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:10,051
It means the opposite of "horse" which is "rat",

352
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:12,151
and the direction of the "rat" is north!

353
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:15,551
There must be something in the North Angel Tower!

354
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:20,651
What are you doing?

355
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,251
That's it! Guys, get off the floor...

356
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:26,851
Yuriko!

357
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,978
Next Conan's Hint:

358
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:36,078
"Direction"

359
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:37,778
I'm going to solve the mystery then Yuriko and I will...

360
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:38,978
What are you saying, Genta?
