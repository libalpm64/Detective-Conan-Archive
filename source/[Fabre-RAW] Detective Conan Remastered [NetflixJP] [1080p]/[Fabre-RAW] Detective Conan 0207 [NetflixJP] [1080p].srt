1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,440
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,040
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040
Be attentive today and listen well,

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,940
because it is a unique mystery that can be experienced only with Conan.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,340
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,190
"An Overly Superb Deduction"

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,090
"Beika Station"

10
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,490
Hey, Ran.

11
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,190
Walk a little slower, will you?

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,090
I tell you. Since it is a hassle having to pick you up,

13
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,290
if you have to drink, don't go and drink on the other side of the station!

14
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,690
Well, well.

15
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,090
Talk about hopelessness.

16
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,490
From 20:00 to 22:00, all you can eat, all you can drink, it says.

17
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,790
You're always going for ads like that!

18
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,990
What do you mean?

19
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,990
I got to eat three times the amount I paid

20
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,290
and drank five times the price, too.

21
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,990
Hey, stop throwing things! Go home!

22
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,490
Go home? What do you mean to go home, you bastard?

23
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,190
Just what do you think you're doing?

24
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,290
Let me go, Nakamoto!

25
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,590
Shut up!

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,190
What shall we do, dad?

27
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,690
We can't ignore them, can we?

28
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,390
I'll go stop them.

29
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,290
Dad. Let me go and handle it.

30
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,790
They'll be fine.

31
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,790
They always fight like that.

32
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,090
But the next minute, they'll be smiling at each other and make up.

33
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,190
Right?

34
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,190
That's a good boy.

35
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,190
I worried for nothing.

36
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,190
Let's go home!

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,690
Hey, dad! Wait for me! You've got to watch your step.

38
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,790
Come on, get a hold of yourself.

39
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,890
Something bothered me,

40
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,190
so I went to check the apartment out the following morning.

41
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,790
We'll get the details after the autopsy,

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,090
but the estimated time of death is between 22:00 to 23:00 last night.

43
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,290
You're joking, right?

44
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,490
-Not you again! -Well, you see.

45
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,690
Then, how else would you explain this?

46
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,490
Inspector Megure, it's just as Mr. Mouri says.

47
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,790
The residents of the apartment also heard them.

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,290
It seems that at the time in question, a man called Nakamoto

49
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,290
was having a heated argument with the victim, Mr. Irie.

50
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,890
And who is the guy called Nakamoto?

51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,190
I... I'll go check!

52
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,590
To think that a detective as renowned as Kogoro Mouri

53
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,490
was not able to stop a murder that happened right before his eyes.

54
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,590
I'm truly ashamed.

55
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,690
Darn it!

56
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,490
Only if that old man who was taking a walk didn't say what he did,

57
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,590
I would've gone in to stop them!

58
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,190
Please help me, Mr. Mouri!

59
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,290
I used to be a member of the Beika University

60
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,290
physics research lab together with the victim Irie.

61
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,590
My name is Nakamoto.

62
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,290
-What? -Nakamoto?

63
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,790
What?

64
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,890
You're the one who killed him last night?

65
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,190
No!

66
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,290
I was summoned by the police for testimony but didn't do anything.

67
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,590
I didn't go to Irie's room last night.

68
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,990
Please believe me.

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:22,190
Listen, we definitely heard you arguing with the man who was killed.

70
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,690
So, what do you mean by you didn't go there?

71
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,290
A tape!

72
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,990
Somebody recorded it on tape to make it look like I went there.

73
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,790
What?

74
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,390
Made it looks like you were there?

75
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,190
Yes.

76
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,990
Irie set the time and probably pressed the play button.

77
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,190
Hey, stop throwing things! Go home!

78
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,790
Go home? What do you mean to go home, you bastard?

79
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,090
You mean he acted it all out alone?

80
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,590
Yes, he was creating my alibi.

81
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,190
Alibi?

82
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,890
For what purpose?

83
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,790
He snuck into the house of our mentor, Professor Demura...

84
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,790
In order to murder him!

85
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,890
What?

86
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,390
The professor is secretly selling

87
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,590
the fruit of our research off to businesses.

88
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,290
Even if we were to file charges against him, he has tremendous authority,

89
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,790
and we'd be ousted.

90
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,890
That's why...

91
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,990
we decided to break into his house when his family was away

92
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,090
and make it look like a case of robbery and homicide.

93
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,490
But, it didn't work out as planned.

94
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,390
We snuck in, but the professor wasn't home.

95
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,590
I waited one hour, but he didn't come home.

96
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,590
So, I eventually gave up.

97
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,290
I went to the professor's house at 22:00

98
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,290
and left at 23:00.

99
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,690
If what you're telling us is true,

100
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,690
you could not have killed Mr. Takayuki Irie.

101
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,990
But the professor seems to have testified that he was doing some writing

102
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,390
in his study all last night, and never left his home.

103
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,490
That sure is strange.

104
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,490
Yes, don't know why the professor is lying.

105
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,190
But, if things go as is I'll end up being a murderer!

106
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,990
I wonder why the police let you, who happens to be a prime suspect go.

107
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,790
I heard at the station that you, the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri,

108
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,890
was also nearby the scene of the crime last night.

109
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,890
This is probably no coincidence,

110
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,390
please I beg you, help me.

111
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,390
It's true that I am not totally uninvolved in this case, but...

112
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,490
So, you don't believe me either, do you, Mr. Mouri?

113
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,290
If only I can find that recorded tape.

114
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,090
Are you sure there really is something like that, to begin with?

115
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,690
I was told that there was no such tape anywhere in Irie's house.

116
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,390
I'm sure the killer took it with him.

117
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,790
If that cannot be found, the killer can frame me!

118
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,090
What shall I do?

119
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,190
I'm sure that the killer has gotten rid of the tape by now, too.

120
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,190
Dad, why don't you at least try searching for the tape?

121
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,190
If you solve this case,

122
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,190
you'll regain your reputation again, won't you, Pops?

123
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,690
Regain my reputation? Okay, why not?

124
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,090
There is only one way in and out of the apartment.

125
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,290
The exit after the crime was committed...

126
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,790
is this street which leads to the station.

127
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,490
The killer is sure to have wanted to get rid of the tape

128
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,790
which would serve as evidence as soon as possible.

129
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,790
Wait! Wait up! That trash!

130
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,590
What is it?

131
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,690
It can't be. This is too close.

132
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,590
I found it!

133
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,090
That's the tape!

134
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,590
Talk about duck soup!

135
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,690
Thank you for your cooperation.

136
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,490
Officer Takagi!

137
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,890
I'll take the evidence.

138
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,890
So, they were keeping watch over the prime suspect.

139
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,290
Wait.

140
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,090
You re not going to take that tape with you, just like that, are you?

141
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,190
Go home? What do you mean to go home, you bastard?

142
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,490
This is the same remark we heard last night.

143
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,690
Right, Conan?

144
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,690
Yes.

145
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,590
I see.

146
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,690
Now, it's been proved.

147
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,890
Mr. Nakamoto is not lying!

148
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,490
I'm glad. I've finally found someone who believes me.

149
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,790
But l wonder why the professor lied.

150
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,490
You can say that again.

151
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,790
I wouldn't have been suspected at all

152
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,490
if the professor didn't lie in the first place!

153
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,290
That's just it. He wanted to set you up as the suspect!

154
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,290
But what advantage would the professor have doing something like that?

155
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,190
It could be that the professor

156
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,290
was somewhere he didn't want anyone to know.

157
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,090
Could it be that he was on his way to kill Mr. Irie?

158
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,290
That's a possibility, but...

159
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,190
That's not possible!

160
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,290
It'd be a different story if he knew about our plan.

161
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,390
We planned everything out in lrie's room.

162
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,490
The professor couldn't have even eavesdropped on us!

163
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,090
Eavesdrop? That could be possible.

164
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,990
Is this the screws of the lid are loose?

165
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,090
It's probably in here.

166
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,090
Is that right? I see. Thank you.

167
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,690
There seems to have been evidence of a wiretap being set, after all?

168
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,990
So, now we know.

169
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,290
Although Professor Demura had been making money

170
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,390
stealing the research by Irie and Nakamoto,

171
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,290
he became wary that maybe one day you would take revenge.

172
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,890
Therefore, he set up a wiretap to keep track of what you were both doing.

173
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,190
I wonder how he snuck in?

174
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,490
If he stole the key from Mr. Irie's locker in the lab,

175
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,290
he could've easily made a spare key, right?

176
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,890
Exactly.

177
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,090
And, while he was tracking your conversation through the wire tap,

178
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,290
he found out of your plan to kill him.

179
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,890
That's when he thought about using the alibi

180
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,790
that you had both made up, his advantage.

181
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,590
Last night, Mr. Irie went on with his one-man act

182
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,190
of creating the alibi tape as usual at a little past 22:00.

183
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,890
Then the professor sneaks in using the spare key

184
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,990
and kills Mr. Irie.

185
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,890
He then steals the tape,

186
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,490
retrieves the wiretap and leaves the site.

187
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,690
If Mr Irie's body is found,

188
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,190
the police would naturally take it to be a crime

189
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,490
committed by Mr Nakamoto, from the testimonies of the people in the area.

190
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,490
In other words, Professor Demura, after killing Mr. Irie,

191
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,790
set it up so that it would look like

192
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,890
Mr. Nakamoto committed the murder.

193
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,490
Our plan was used to his advantage.

194
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,290
Very skillfully indeed.

195
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,890
But he was unable to fool

196
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,290
the eyes of the top-notch, renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri's eyes.

197
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,290
Hey, hey, what's up, Pops?

198
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,090
Your deduction is perfect.

199
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,290
I guess I'm not called for this time.

200
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,390
What are you bragging about?

201
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,690
If you went into Mr. Irie's room last night,

202
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,290
you could've stopped the murder from happening, you know?

203
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,590
Come on, don't say that.

204
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,490
Oh, I heard from Inspector Megure that a man

205
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,490
who was walking his dog stopped you from going inside.

206
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,090
Right, only if that old man didn't say what he did.

207
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,090
True, but that old man didn't have any bad intentions either.

208
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,290
Don't tell me that...

209
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,790
But, if thought of it that way, it is convincing.

210
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,290
Even Pop's superb power of deduction...

211
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,580
Okay!

212
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,780
So, I guess I'll go tell Inspector Megure of my superb deduction,

213
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,980
in order to regain my reputation!

214
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,480
Not that!

215
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,080
What? What's not that?

216
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,280
Well, it's a superb deduction after all,

217
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,980
why go all the way out there and tell him about it?

218
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
Why not have him come here from his side?

219
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,180
It's cooler that way.

220
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,880
I guess so.

221
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,080
-Okay! -I'm going to go out play until then.

222
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,680
"Mouri Detective Agency"

223
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,880
So, the alibi scheme was used against the very ones who made it up.

224
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,480
I see. Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

225
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,080
Well, I'm just being my usual self.

226
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,180
I'm sorry for having suspected you, Mr. Nakamoto.

227
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,880
Don't be, so long as you find out the truth.

228
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,280
Besides, I'm still to be charged for sneaking into the professor's house.

229
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,880
Well, we'll take care of that later.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,180
Officer Takagi.

231
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,680
Get an arrest warrant for Professor Demura on the double.

232
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Yes, sir.

233
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,280
Please wait for a second, inspector!

234
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,480
However, the deduction that I have presented you is just one possibility.

235
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,680
The one that the real killer wished the case to look like.

236
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,780
What the real killer wish?

237
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,180
Just what do you mean, Mouri?

238
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Please sit down once again.

239
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,580
What I am about to say from now is the real truth.

240
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,980
The testimonies of Mr. Nakamoto and Professor Demura

241
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,380
are really different.

242
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,180
That is, one of them is lying.

243
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,180
At a timelike that, if the tape that Mr. Nakamoto mentioned is found,

244
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,380
his testimony would naturally sound to be the truth.

245
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,480
On the other hand,

246
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
suspicion against Professor Demura would grow.

247
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,280
All that needs to be done next,

248
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,780
is to lead the deduction in the preferred direction.

249
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,080
And make everybody fall under the illusion

250
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,780
that Professor Demura had indeed killed Mr. Irie.

251
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,980
An illusion?

252
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,180
Lead the deduction?

253
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,280
Are you saying that somebody lead everyone

254
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,680
to think that it happened that way?

255
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,180
It is indeed possible.

256
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,380
As for the recorded tape...

257
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,580
The killer probably got rid of it, too.

258
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,280
Because Mr. Nakamoto had mumbled,

259
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,680
so I was led to check inside the trash can near the site.

260
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
The reason I turned my attention to Professor Demura was because...

261
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,280
I wouldn't have been suspected at all

262
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,080
if the professor didn't lie in the first place!

263
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,380
Mr. Nakamoto said what he did. And...

264
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,880
It could be that the professor

265
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,280
was somewhere he didn't want anyone to know he was.

266
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,880
From his remark, I was lead to think

267
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,880
that maybe Professor Demura had set off to kill Mr. Irie.

268
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,680
Furthermore...

269
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,280
The professor couldn't have even eavesdropped on us.

270
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,580
I was lead to imagine a wire tap

271
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,280
from his remark "eavesdropping".

272
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,380
In other words, by deliberately casually remarking the things

273
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,580
that he did about the essentials,

274
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Mr. Nakamoto lead me to deduce

275
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,280
that Professor Demura had committed the crime.

276
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
That is, I did not make a deduction,

277
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,580
but rather was lead to make a deduction.

278
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,580
By who else, but Mr. Nakamoto himself.

279
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,980
I see.

280
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,780
Needless to mention,

281
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,680
you never snuck into Professor Demura's house.

282
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,480
The one who snuck in when Mr. Irie was putting on his one-man act,

283
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,080
and killed him...

284
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,280
is you!

285
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,880
Professor Demura was probably in his study just as he said he was.

286
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,080
Of course, there was no wiretap, to begin with either.

287
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,080
You were the one who loosened the screws of the outlet.

288
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,580
Isn't that right, Mr. Nakamoto?

289
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,980
First of all, the story about the recorded tape is strange, to begin with.

290
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,980
If it were disposed of last night right after the crime,

291
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,480
it would never have been found.

292
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,080
Because the trash of that convenience store is collected daily

293
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,980
before dawn by the trash collectors.

294
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,480
However, the tape that wasn't supposed to be there, was found there.

295
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Which means the tape was not disposed of last night, but rather, today

296
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,180
after the trash collectors came.

297
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,180
If the tape is taken away, you wouldn't have been able to lead us to it.

298
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,880
Right, Mr. Nakamoto?

299
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,580
You have no evidence of anything, Mr. Mouri.

300
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,680
That's all mere paper plans that detectives are known to be good at.

301
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,880
This is no paper plan.

302
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,480
Unfortunately, Mr. Nakamoto, there is a witness.

303
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,980
A witness?

304
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,680
I was asked to come here a while ago by Conan.

305
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,980
I asked him to ask you to come here.

306
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,380
So, Mr. Nakamoto had to figure out who he would let make the deduction.

307
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,380
And that person had to be someone that the police would listen to.

308
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,580
So, you turned your attention to me, the renowned detective, Kogoro Mouri.

309
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,280
But, you were worried that I may turn you down

310
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,780
if you came to me just like that.

311
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,680
To make sure that I would listen to you,

312
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,780
you deliberately got me involved

313
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,680
by setting me up as a witness.

314
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,180
How?

315
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,580
Knowing that I love to drink,

316
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,380
you left an ad for an all you can eat and drink

317
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,080
between 20:00 to 22:00 in my post box.

318
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,080
I see. Mouri would undoubtedly fall for it.

319
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,980
Therefore, I would pass by Mr. Irie's apartment

320
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,580
after 22:00 on my way home.

321
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,480
But, in order to get the timing right,

322
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,280
Irie probably started his one-man act after confirming us passing by.

323
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,580
He had no way of knowing that he was going to be murdered,

324
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,180
so he did just as planned.

325
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,580
But, then why is Azusa from the restaurant below a witness?

326
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,880
That's because...

327
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Nakamoto, you put this ad in the post box yesterday morning, didn't you?

328
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,980
She saw you do so.

329
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,880
How about it, Azusa? Are you sure it was him?

330
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
Yes. He's the one.

331
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,880
When I came to the shop in the morning,

332
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,480
he was putting a red ad sheet in the mailbox.

333
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,280
I think it was the same as that one over there.

334
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,980
Your fingerprints would most naturally be found on the ad if checked for.

335
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,080
That ad was only distributed

336
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,580
on the other side of the station in the first place.

337
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,980
Why did you have to go out of your way to put that ad in my mailbox,

338
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,280
Nakamoto?

339
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,680
And I thought everything worked out perfect.

340
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
How did you figure everything out?

341
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
When did you suspect me?

342
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,180
You just talked too much.

343
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,780
Oh, I heard from Inspector Megure

344
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,980
that a man who was walking his dog stopped you from going inside.

345
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,280
I told the inspector that a man taking a walk,

346
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,380
but I didn't give him the details about the old man walking his dog.

347
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,680
I probably would've given him more details

348
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,880
if no witness was found, though.

349
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,880
What a klutz I am.

350
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,280
If I went in there and stopped you both from fighting,

351
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
everything would go down the drain.

352
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,680
So, you kept me from going into the room.

353
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,880
The old man who was walking the dog was you, wasn't it?

354
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,580
I was right after all.

355
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,080
Mr. Mouri, you are a renowned detective after all.

356
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,480
No, rather you are too renowned.

357
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,880
In the battle for the rights and fame

358
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,580
of the research they were developing,

359
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,880
Mr. Nakamoto deceived his colleague, Mr. Irie,

360
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,680
and eventually killed him.

361
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,280
He then tried to frame Professor Demura as the killer

362
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,680
and take everything for himself.

363
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,280
"Mouri"

364
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,980
Another ad. What's this?

365
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,680
Starting tomorrow, 3 days sale of beer all you can drink?

366
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,080
Come on. Dad, what's the matter with you?

367
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,480
Give it back!

368
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,980
If I drink cheap liquor, it'll help with the household budget, won't it?

369
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,180
Stop drinking before saying something like that.

370
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,480
But I promise I won't do anything stupid again.

371
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,680
Hey, hey, don't you ever get fed up, or what?

372
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,820
Next Conan's Hint:
