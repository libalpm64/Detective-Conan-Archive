1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,240
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,340
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,940
A strange case at an ordinary train station.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,840
There's only a marginal difference between goodwill and evil.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,460
Ghads.

9
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,960
You keep drinking so much juice,

10
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,060
that's why you have to keep going to the restroom.

11
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,660
But, it was good, wasn't it, Pops?

12
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,660
It would've been nice if Ran could've come with us, too.

13
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,160
It can't be helped, can it?

14
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,860
She had club practice and suddenly ended up not being able to come.

15
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,960
By the way, what do you say?

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,560
That we go have some ramen before going home.

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,360
What? You're going to eat again?

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,360
There's something about French food that gives me stiff shoulders.

19
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,260
I don't feel like I've satisfied my appetite.

20
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,460
Come on, let's go drop by at a ramen shop.

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Next stop is West Sumita Station.

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Transfer here for the Saika Express.

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,860
"The Truth Behind the Death Fall"

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,360
The train will come in. Please stand behind the white line.

25
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,960
-So, for ramen! -West Sumita Station.

26
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,860
Let's go, Conan! I think I want salt flavored ramen.

27
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,660
What flavor do you want?

28
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,060
Hey, Pop's really set on going?

29
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,260
You bastard!

30
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,560
Talk about trouble, those guys.

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,660
Cut it out, cut it out! Stop fighting!

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,260
I'm telling you, cut it out! Are you guys deaf or what?

33
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,060
Inspector Goto, we've been waiting for you.

34
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,260
Is anything wrong?

35
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
Mouri?

36
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,260
You're Mr. Mouri, that renowned detective!

37
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,860
Really?

38
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,260
Yes.

39
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,460
I am Goto of West Sumita Police Station.

40
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,860
Well, I've heard a lot about you.

41
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,960
But, I didn't think I'd get to see you here.

42
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,460
I'm really honored.

43
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,060
He coincidentally witnessed

44
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,560
what may be the cause of this incident.

45
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,260
You did, Mr. Mouri?

46
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,360
Yes. But well...

47
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I didn't think that something like this was going to happen.

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Well, it's really a great help that you're here, Mr. Mouri.

49
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,260
We're counting on you.

50
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,660
I hope I can be of help.

51
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,560
I guess you can leave things to me since I'm here anyway.

52
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,260
Hey, hey.

53
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,760
Have you identified the victim?

54
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,460
Yes, he is Keisuke Furuta, age 42.

55
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,660
He is an office worker who lives nearby.

56
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,760
He seems to always come home on this train,

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,960
and it seems that he was on his way back home today, too.

58
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,160
The cause of his death is due to a fractured skull

59
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,060
from a violent blow to his head.

60
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,160
He got into a fight with this person here,

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Mr. Hideki Sugimoto, age 27.

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,860
He works at a company in the city of Tokyo.

63
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,060
I am Goto from the West Sumita Police Station.

64
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,160
Will you please explain what just happened?

65
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
It's kind of noisy here.

66
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,460
You may use the break room for station employees if you like.

67
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,660
Mr. Noriwaki.

68
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,860
Yes, sir. This way, please.

69
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
That would be a great help.

70
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,960
What is this wound he has here?

71
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,060
I went to an after-hours business contact meeting tonight,

72
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,160
and I was on my way back home.

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,660
I suddenly had to go to the restroom

74
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,060
and put my knapsack on the net shelf,

75
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,760
then headed for the restroom.

76
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,360
My stomach was feeling queasy

77
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,760
so I stayed inside for some time and came out.

78
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,960
My knapsack was gone.

79
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
And?

80
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Then, I happened to look out at the platform

81
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,760
and saw him with my knapsack.

82
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,460
Hold it!

83
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,960
What do you think you're doing? That's my knapsack!

84
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,460
Just what do you think you're doing?

85
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,160
What's with you?

86
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,260
He wouldn't give my knapsack back to me.

87
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,760
So you got into a fight?

88
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,060
Yes.

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,660
And when I tried to take my knapsack back...

90
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,860
The strap cut off, and...

91
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Unluckily the under construction fence wasn't there.

92
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,060
Which means you have never meet Mr. Furuta before?

93
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,560
No, I haven't.

94
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,460
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

95
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,760
I feel sorry for him.

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,160
But Mr. Furuta wouldn't have gone through what he did

97
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
if he didn't take Mr. Sugimoto's knapsack in the first place.

98
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,760
I wonder

99
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,360
if Mr. Furuta was really trying to steal Mr. Sugimoto's bag?

100
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
What do you mean?

101
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,260
Maybe he thought that somebody had forgotten it?

102
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,660
Forgotten?

103
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,860
Yes.

104
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,660
He has delivered forgotten goods to us

105
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,060
several times in the past, too.

106
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,960
Among all of us, we thought that he was a nice person,

107
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,560
a rare breed, not too easily found in recent years.

108
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,660
He doesn't seem like the type who would steal something

109
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,560
that someone else had forgotten.

110
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Really?

111
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
Yes.

112
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,560
Mr. Mouri.

113
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,860
If it's really as you say,

114
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,260
he may have confirmed the owner of the bag

115
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,660
before he got off the train.

116
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,260
Go and question the passengers on the double.

117
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,460
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,460
Inspector.

119
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,960
Please calm down, Mr. Sugimoto.

120
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,860
We have to wait for testimony from witnesses.

121
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,160
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,060
It's just as the station employee had said.

123
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,560
Mr. Furuta seems to have confirmed whether the owner was around

124
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,860
before getting off the train.

125
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,960
Really?

126
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,660
Yes. There was a passenger who remembered you, Mr. Sugimoto,

127
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,860
when you stood to go to the restroom,

128
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,360
and also saw that Mr. Furuta came on the train after you.

129
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,660
In other words, Mr. Sugimoto went to the restroom

130
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,860
leaving his knapsack on the net shelf.

131
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,360
Then Mr. Furuta who boarded the train later,

132
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
took the knapsack to be a forgotten item,

133
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
took it and got off the train.

134
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,660
Mr. Sugimoto who had gone to the restroom

135
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,560
thought that his knapsack was being stolen,

136
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,860
found Mr. Furuta among the passengers

137
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,860
who had gotten off the train and tried to get it back.

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,760
Mr. Furuta thought that he confirmed the owner,

139
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,860
so when he was told to "Give the knapsack back",

140
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,560
he couldn't believe it off the bat.

141
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,960
Mr. Furuta was also probably a very righteous man.

142
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,660
He probably got into a fight

143
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,660
trying to keep the knapsack from being taken away.

144
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,260
I guess this is a tragedy that was born from a misunderstanding.

145
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Oh, no.

146
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,360
Mr. Sugimoto, you're to blame too, you know?

147
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,560
You didn't have to jump on him so aggressively as you did, too.

148
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,960
I lost my temper.

149
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,260
He goes out of his way to deliver a forgotten item

150
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,360
and dies, poor guy.

151
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,060
You can have this back.

152
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,860
It's gone.

153
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,560
What seems to be the matter?

154
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
The receipt is gone.

155
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,860
Receipt?

156
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,260
The receipt of the store I went to with my client.

157
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,360
I had it in here with the change.

158
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,660
Both are gone.

159
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,660
Maybe you put it in your pocket or something?

160
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,460
No, I'm positive I put it in the wallet.

161
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,860
Give me a break.

162
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,260
Maybe it fell on the platform

163
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,560
when you were struggling with each other.

164
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
Officer Saito.

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,660
I'll go check.

166
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,560
How was it?

167
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,760
Well, there was nothing of that sort on the platform.

168
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,660
But inspector...

169
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,360
I brought Mr. Furuta's belongings.

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,560
Japanese Restaurant Sasayama?

171
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,960
Inspector, could you show me that?

172
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,660
Go ahead.

173
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,960
Excuse me.

174
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,760
Just as I thought.

175
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
This is the receipt I was looking for.

176
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,260
See. Mr. Hideki Sugimoto.

177
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,860
The price was for the food was 25,000 yen.

178
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,160
But, why was it in Mr. Furuta's pocket?

179
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,460
I can't figure it out.

180
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,160
The thing is...

181
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,060
It was just once in the past.

182
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,760
But, there was a time that money was taken

183
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,160
from the forgotten item that Mr. Furuta had turned in.

184
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
What?

185
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,660
Back then, Mr. Furuta was suspected, too.

186
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,260
But, he was deemed innocent after we decided

187
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
that the thief wouldn't go out of his way to turn in a stolen item.

188
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,660
I see. So that's the story.

189
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,860
Mr. Furuta probably had a habit of stealing money

190
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,760
from the forgotten items he turned in.

191
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,960
A habitual thief?

192
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,260
That's why he couldn't return the knapsack.

193
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,360
Because if he did, the fact that he stole the money

194
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,060
would be revealed on the spot.

195
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,360
Is that so?

196
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,260
I can't believe Mr. Furuta would ever do something like that.

197
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,860
It's very difficult to believe.

198
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,560
Mr. Sugimoto!

199
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,960
Yes.

200
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,460
Just to be safe, will you check to see

201
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,760
if anything else had been stolen?

202
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,860
Yes, sir.

203
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,360
Everything else is here.

204
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,760
I see.

205
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,160
Please fill in this form then.

206
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
Yes.

207
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Could you please lend me a ball pen?

208
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,760
Excuse me for not noticing it.

209
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
Here you are.

210
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,260
Thank you.

211
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,860
You bastard!

212
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
It's just as I thought.

213
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,160
I see.

214
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,260
I figured out the real truth hidden behind this accident.

215
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,690
Ghads, what kind of important talk could there be?

216
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,890
And where'd Conan go off to after calling me out like this?

217
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,690
Pops, you can leave the rest to me.

218
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,890
Okay, this will be fine.

219
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,290
Inspector Goto.

220
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,590
What is it?

221
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,490
Mr. Mouri wants all of us to come to the platform.

222
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,990
To the platform?

223
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,890
What on earth is it, Mr. Mouri?

224
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,190
That pose is...

225
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,490
The rumored "Sleeping Kogoro"?

226
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,290
But inspector...

227
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,690
Mr. Mouri, this case was solved as being an accident

228
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,590
that happened from a man trying to get back his knapsack.

229
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,390
Inspector Goto, that's not the story, though.

230
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,390
What?

231
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,090
Just what do you mean?

232
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,390
I'll explain that in a minute.

233
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,790
First of all, will all of you

234
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,290
try to recall Mr. Sugimoto's testimony?

235
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,590
It's true that Mr. Sugimoto returned after going to the restroom

236
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,590
and realized that his knapsack was gone.

237
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,890
He sees Mr. Furuta on the platform and rushes off the train.

238
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,490
That's right, isn't it?

239
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,590
Yes, right.

240
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,590
But we saw Mr. Sugimoto

241
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,890
came dashing out from near the vending machine, instead.

242
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,990
And is there anything strange about it?

243
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,490
Don't you think it's funny?

244
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,690
If Mr. Sugimoto jumped off the train from the front,

245
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,290
why would he be in a place like that?

246
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,790
He would've run there from a different direction.

247
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,890
I see.

248
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,090
Come to think of it, yes.

249
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,690
It's unnatural that he was by the vending machine over there.

250
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,890
But, why did Mr. Sugimoto do that?

251
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,990
He was waiting

252
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,790
for Mr. Furuta to take the money out.

253
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,790
What?

254
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,190
Why?

255
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,490
You're only running wild on imagination.

256
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,590
Mr. Sugimoto probably knew

257
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,390
that Mr. Furuta would take money out of the wallet

258
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,690
pretending to turn the knapsack in.

259
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,390
That's why he left the receipt

260
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,090
inside his wallet deliberately with the money.

261
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,190
Because if the receipt is found,

262
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,990
and the fact that Mr. Furuta stole the money is revealed,

263
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,690
Mr. Sugimoto aggressively trying to get his knapsack back

264
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,790
would be justified.

265
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,290
That's not true!

266
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,990
Then?

267
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,590
Yes, Mr. Sugimoto deliberately put the net shelf

268
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,690
and went to the restroom

269
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,590
to make Mr. Furuta steal the money.

270
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,890
There were other passengers on the train.

271
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,490
Why did Mr. Furuta think that the knapsack was a forgotten item?

272
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,890
The cell phone.

273
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,590
The cell phone?

274
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,490
Didn't you realize

275
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,690
that there was a cell phone inside the knapsack?

276
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,290
Probably a cell phone with a history of incoming calls.

277
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,990
Mr. Sugimoto, who went to the restroom

278
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,190
just before arriving at West Sumita Station,

279
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,290
with his other cell phone

280
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,290
and called the cell phone in the knapsack.

281
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,390
The phone rang, but no one answered it.

282
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,290
That's why he thought that the knapsack was a forgotten item.

283
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,890
I see.

284
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,290
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

285
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,090
Mr. Sugimoto quietly watched

286
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,890
while Mr. Furuta hid behind materials of the construction site

287
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,690
and took out the money.

288
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,090
He grabbed Mr. Furuta and dragged him

289
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,490
and pushed him into the keep-out area.

290
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,490
Then, he pushed him over with all his might.

291
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,390
Of course,

292
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,590
the rope that held the fence of the keep-out area in place

293
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,990
was cut beforehand.

294
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,090
Then all he had to do next

295
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,090
was pull the knapsack from Mr. Furuta

296
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,590
who was down on the ground.

297
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,490
If Mr. Furuta fought back to keep the knapsack from being taken away,

298
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,090
the strap which had been cut in advance would be slit

299
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,490
and Mr. Furuta who loses balance would fall off

300
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,790
the overpass platform to the ground below.

301
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,190
The shoulder strap was cut beforehand?

302
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,190
I'm sorry but I would have to check it.

303
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,090
Inspector!

304
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,190
Yes, it was no accident.

305
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,190
It was a planned murder under the pretext of an accident.

306
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,490
That's absurd!

307
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,390
That's nothing more than a far fetched story.

308
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,590
Listen, he tried with all his might

309
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,790
and resisted giving me back the knapsack.

310
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,390
How could I have knocked him down, then pushed him over?

311
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,690
Things don't work out that well.

312
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,790
As a matter of fact it does.

313
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,890
If you use the ballpoint pen

314
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,590
that you have stuck to the inner pocket of your suit.

315
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,390
Ballpoint pen?

316
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,590
You cornered him to behind the materials

317
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,890
and poked Mr. Furuta with all your might with that ball pen.

318
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,590
While Mr. Furuta flinched from the pain,

319
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,390
you pushed him.

320
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,790
The mark left by the ball pen was left

321
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,990
plain and clear on the back of his hand.

322
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,590
How about it, Mr. Sugimoto?

323
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,290
Mr. Sugimoto.

324
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,490
I couldn't forgive him!

325
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,590
He took the life of my girl!

326
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,290
6 months ago.

327
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,090
He rammed full speed into my girlfriend

328
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,590
who was crossing the pedestrian crossing.

329
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,090
We were going to get married soon.

330
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,690
There were no witnesses

331
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,490
and Furuta's version insisting

332
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,090
that the pedestrian ran into the street went through,

333
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,490
and he wasn't even prosecuted.

334
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,690
That's much too cruel.

335
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,690
Ruthless.

336
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,590
So, you decided to kill Mr. Furuta

337
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,090
under the pretext of an accident.

338
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,790
I just couldn't...

339
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,290
I just couldn't make myself forgive him.

340
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,190
"Mouri Detective Agency"

341
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,490
Okay, it's ready.

342
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,090
I tell you, Dad.

343
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,190
Just because the ramen shops were closed

344
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,690
you don't have to go out of the way to cup ramen, do you?

345
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,390
Don't you agree, Conan?

346
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,990
Who cares? What's the big deal?

347
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,390
This is just the thing for me after all.

348
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,090
It's so good.

349
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,290
Maybe I'll have another serving.

350
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,590
You're going to get fat.

351
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,290
Well, this indeed matches Pops

352
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,990
more than French cuisine for sure.

353
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,340
"Reel"
Next Conan's Hint:

354
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,760
The next episode is a new development.

355
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,020
A red Porsche, a white one, a green one and a black one.
