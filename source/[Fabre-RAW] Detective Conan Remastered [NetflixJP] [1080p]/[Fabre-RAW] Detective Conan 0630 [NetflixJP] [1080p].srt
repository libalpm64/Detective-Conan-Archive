1
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:06,825
We came to enjoy staying at a pension on a southern island,

2
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:09,425
and ran into actor Mr. Yuya Miyasaka

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:13,425
who was shooting a promotion video with his staff.

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:17,325
Ever since he got caught for an assault case a year ago,

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,125
Mr. Miyasaka's popularity had been on a downfall.

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:23,125
The promotion video was being made to regain his popularity.

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,625
However, since he forced his staff to do unreasonable stunts,

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,007
and at times got violent with them,

9
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:32,011
discontent was growing among the staff.

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,125
Mr. Miyasaka's ex-girlfriend

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,015
as well as the co-starring actress, Ms. Saeko Akimoto

12
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,525
seems to have ill feelings

13
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:43,125
against the relationship between him and make-up artist, Miki Kitagawa.

14
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,625
And a crime was committed along with the coming of the storm.

15
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,225
Mr. Miyasaka was killed

16
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:53,225
in his room in the pension by someone.

17
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,125
A murder is committed in a pension closed off

18
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,425
because of violent wind and rain.

19
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:01,125
The culprit is unmistakably in here!

20
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,225
Like the fog clears.

21
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,425
Let's see through love and crime as well.

22
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:09,325
The uncomfortable something that Conan feels at the scene of the crime.

23
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:11,525
The truth that was recorded on the video camera.

24
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,025
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,025
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,225
His name is Detective Conan.

27
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:04,163
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 2)"

28
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:15,295
"Mitsuo Okita (23), Camera Assistant"

29
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:21,395
"Shingo Takayama (28), Cameraman" -Hey.

30
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:25,395
Just how long do we have to stay in this room?

31
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,187
"Osamu Kurohashi (43), Pension Owner" -Until the police arrive.

32
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,695
"Keiko Kurahashi (38), Osamu's Wife" -If we all stay in the same room,

33
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:31,495
the culprit won't be able to get away.

34
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,295
"Saeko Akimoto (25), Actress" -Get away?

35
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,495
Where on earth can you get away to

36
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:37,195
on an isolated island in the storm?

37
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,395
"Yamamoto Eiji (21), Assistant Director" -I'm not the culprit,

38
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,795
so I don't have to run.

39
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:45,395
"Kitagawa Miki (22), Make-up Artist"

40
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:48,207
I'm going back to my room.

41
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,695
If you want to suspect me as being the culprit, suit yourself.

42
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:58,217
Rather than that, is the police really going to come?

43
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,895
Mr. Takayama,

44
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:02,695
you really seem concerned about the police, don't you?

45
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,395
Don't tell me that you're...

46
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:06,795
The culprit?

47
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:10,229
What's the big deal?

48
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,395
I just asked because the police is late getting here!

49
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:16,235
Done with the recording of testimonies!

50
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,695
I'm leaving too!

51
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,895
It's even more suspicious because he's acting so upset.

52
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:28,795
May I go back to my room too?

53
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,595
Me too, then.

54
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:39,195
If all the four without alibis have left this room,

55
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,895
there's no reason why we should be here anymore, is there?

56
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,595
Excuse me.

57
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:52,795
Everybody's gone.

58
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,495
I'm sort of hungry.

59
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:02,795
Of course you're hungry, it's already this late.

60
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:06,285
I'll bring some dishes I can get ready right away and bring them here.

61
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,287
Awesome!

62
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:12,295
I wonder if that man named Mr. Takayama is the culprit after all?

63
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,795
Well, I wonder about that.

64
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:18,895
He did look as if he was afraid of the police though.

65
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:20,895
That uncomfortable feeling that something wasn't right

66
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,995
when I saw Mr. Miyasaka's body.

67
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:25,695
I can't helped being bothered about it.

68
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,307
I've got no choice.

69
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,595
If I can't watch the video that was taken,

70
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:34,095
I'll just have to go back to the scene of the crime again and confirm.

71
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:37,295
I don't have my wallet.

72
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,195
I may have dropped it in Mr. Miyasaka's room when I went in a while ago.

73
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,321
Huh?

74
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,323
How do you know that you didn't drop in other place

75
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,495
rather than Mr. Miyasaka's room?

76
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:51,195
I've got this feeling.

77
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,333
Don't do that to me.

78
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,595
Okay, I'll go get it for you, then.

79
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,339
I'll go with you!

80
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,351
You wait here.

81
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:21,695
Poor thing,

82
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,363
the knife is stabbed so deeply into him.

83
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,195
Oh, no.

84
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:48,387
He's completely cold...

85
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,695
I found my wallet over here!

86
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,895
So you found it?

87
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,195
Strange.

88
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:01,195
The uncomfortable feeling of something being wrong

89
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,995
when I first saw him is gone.

90
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:07,295
Was it just my imagination?

91
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,595
We're eating...

92
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,595
It's good!

93
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:17,195
It sure is good.

94
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,995
I'm glad.

95
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:21,795
I wonder if Conan found his wallet?

96
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:25,195
Miki!

97
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,427
I just don't feel comfortable, just the two of us.

98
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,429
Could I stay here with you?

99
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,995
Sure. Dinner's ready too.

100
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,195
Come here next to me.

101
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,435
Thank you.

102
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:41,395
Miki, what's the matter?

103
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,441
I just saw

104
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,895
Mr. Takayama run by outside the window.

105
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,795
In this storm?

106
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,495
It can't be!

107
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:52,451
So, Mr. Takayama was the culprit after all!

108
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,453
I see. He got scared that the police would come

109
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,795
and decided to run for it!

110
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:02,461
Hey, you guys?

111
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,095
Mr. Kurahashi!

112
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,295
What's the matter?

113
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:07,195
Did something happen?

114
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,895
The culprit fled!

115
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:10,995
The culprit?

116
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,895
Mr. Takayama!

117
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,395
Miki saw Mr. Takayama

118
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,477
outside the window fleeing!

119
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:28,487
Are you sure he went in this direction?

120
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:29,595
Yes.

121
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:32,495
He went running eastward.

122
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,695
But, there's a cliff ahead and it's a dead end.

123
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,495
Hey, Mr. Takayama!

124
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:46,795
Hey!

125
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:49,895
Mr. Takayama!

126
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,995
This is...

127
00:08:57,095 --> 00:08:58,895
Mr. Takayama.

128
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,095
They're exhausted and all fell asleep.

129
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:21,795
After Mr. Miyasaka, now Mr. Takayama is dead.

130
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,595
He was probably fleeing and couldn't see in the dark,

131
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:28,547
so slipped and fell over the cliff.

132
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,295
How stupid can he get.

133
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:37,895
But, at least it's good that we know who the culprit was, now.

134
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,559
So, the case is closed.

135
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,895
But I wonder if Mr. Takayama was really the culprit?

136
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:46,995
Of course, there's no mistake about it!

137
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:48,567
Can you think of another reason

138
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,095
why someone would go bursting out on a stormy night like this?

139
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:54,595
But, he should've known that even if he went bursting out,

140
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,575
there is no way off this island, right?

141
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,195
Well...

142
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,995
Let's say that Mr. Takayama was the culprit,

143
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:06,585
the story fits into place too well for him to coincidentally lose his life.

144
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,295
Maybe Mr. Takayama was also killed.

145
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:10,589
In other words,

146
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,593
we haven't cleared off the list of suspects yet, have we?

147
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,095
Since Mr. Takayama is dead,

148
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,195
you probably want to say that the three of us,

149
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,601
that is, Mr. Okita, Yamamoto and I are the suspects, right?

150
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,603
I'm not the culprit!

151
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:27,295
I'll show you proof of it right now!

152
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,695
I'll show you the video that I took when I went to Mr. Miyasaka's room!

153
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:32,611
If you watch this,

154
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,195
it should show you that I didn't kill Miyasaka.

155
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:38,295
Is he going to play that video?

156
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:42,295
I'm sorry, but as I mentioned before, I can't bear watching that video.

157
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:45,695
Yeah, Mr. Miyasaka's dead body is taken.

158
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,627
But, it's to prove that I'm innocent!

159
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:51,795
I'm sorry but if you can't bear watching it, keep your eyes closed!

160
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,641
Okay, I'm going to play it.

161
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,707
I'm Okita, in charge of the behind-the-scenes.

162
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:13,107
I'm going to charge into Mr. Miyasaka's room from now.

163
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,607
This is Mr. Miyasaka's room.

164
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:22,661
So, I wonder what Mr. Miyasaka is doing right now?

165
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:27,207
The door is slightly opened.

166
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,669
There's something stuck between the door.

167
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:35,007
It looks to be a bottle of foundation.

168
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:38,207
Okay, I'm going inside.

169
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:46,685
What's wrong?

170
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,307
Mr. Takayama, Mr. Miyasaka is...

171
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:55,607
Miyasaka! No way?

172
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,697
Okita! Go get everybody!

173
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,207
Yes, sir!

174
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,701
How about it?

175
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,907
When I went there, Mr. Miyasaka was already dead!

176
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:09,907
Now, you know I didn't do it, right?

177
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,107
Which means

178
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,607
that either Saeko or Mr. Yamamoto did it.

179
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,907
Hey! Cut out saying weird stuff like that!

180
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:21,207
She's right! I didn't do it!

181
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,407
I've finally figured out what was bothering me.

182
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,107
Conan.

183
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,607
I got go to the restroom.

184
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,907
Sonoko? Don't tell me that...

185
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,607
What's going on?

186
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:47,607
When Sonoko dances this dance,

187
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:50,749
she turns into a great detective called the Deduction Queen!

188
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,751
Deduction Queen?

189
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:58,107
Maybe we've been making a big mistake.

190
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,107
Mr. Okita, I'm sorry to trouble you

191
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:03,307
but will you show us the video one more time?

192
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:07,507
Yeah.

193
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:11,307
Please show us the part where Mr. Miyasaka's dead body is displayed.

194
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,207
I think it's just about here.

195
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,407
Mr. Yamamoto,

196
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:20,779
are you sure that there's no mistake

197
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,007
about this knife being the prop that was used?

198
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:27,407
Yes. I think so.

199
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,707
Please take a good look at it.

200
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:32,791
Doesn't something look wrong?

201
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,793
Something wrong?

202
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,307
The coke stain's not there!

203
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:39,807
True!

204
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:42,801
There's no stain on the handle of the knife.

205
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,805
Hold it.

206
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,307
When I went to look for Conan's wallet a while ago,

207
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:53,307
I took another good look at the dead body...

208
00:13:56,807 --> 00:14:00,207
and I'm sure that the handle of the knife was stained with coke!

209
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,507
Yes.

210
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,407
This means that there were two knives.

211
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:07,907
What?

212
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:09,307
Two knives?

213
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,507
Wait, then what?

214
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:14,007
Do you mean that after he was stabbed once,

215
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:16,007
he was stabbed again with another knife?

216
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:18,307
Why would anybody do something like that?

217
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:20,307
And besides, if so, then when was the knife

218
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,307
stabbed into him a second time?

219
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,507
The room is auto locked and the door was locked.

220
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:27,807
Nobody could've gotten inside unless with the master key!

221
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:31,507
But, the door can be opened from inside the room.

222
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,907
From inside the room?

223
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,855
But, only Mr. Miyasaka's body was in the room.

224
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:41,307
What if Mr. Miyasaka wasn't dead yet then?

225
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,507
What is your remark based on anyway?

226
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,863
My remarked is based on the

227
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,865
existence of that bottle of liquid foundation.

228
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,607
The bottle of liquid foundation

229
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:52,507
that was stuck between the door of Mr. Miyasaka's room.

230
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,807
It's much too unnatural that it was left

231
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:58,407
standing upside down stuck between the door.

232
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:00,879
Don't you sense there was something intentional here?

233
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,881
Intentional?

234
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:06,885
A liquid foundation bottle left standing upside down?

235
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,907
Liquid foundation bottle standing upside down...

236
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:11,907
Candid!

237
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,607
Exactly! He was going to make a candid camera video

238
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:17,807
and surprise everyone by pretending to be dead.

239
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:19,707
It's most likely that the first knife

240
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,807
that was stabbed into him without the coke stain on.

241
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:24,903
It was a fake knife with no sharp tip to it.

242
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,307
The blood was paint that's usually used when shooting films

243
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,607
that was spread over the body.

244
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:33,607
He was planning to make a candid camera video

245
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:36,915
by making us find him that way and shocking us.

246
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:40,307
Mr. Miyasaka would surely come up with something like that.

247
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,407
No,

248
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,507
this is something that the culprit conned Mr. Miyasaka into doing.

249
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:49,507
The culprit wanted to use it to kill him.

250
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:52,307
However, Mr. Miyasaka did something

251
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:55,507
that was not included in the culprit's plan.

252
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:58,307
Mr. Miyasaka who was totally unaware

253
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:00,707
that he was really going to be killed.

254
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:04,943
Playfully put the bottle of foundation where it was.

255
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,007
That, although unintentionally turned out to be his dying message.

256
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,207
By the way, he needed an accomplice

257
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,607
to work out this liquid foundation thing.

258
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,207
An accomplice?

259
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:20,007
Come to think of it, back then...

260
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,507
He's got no pulse.

261
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,707
It's too late.

262
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:28,967
Mr. Takayama was the one who confirmed Mr. Miyasaka's death.

263
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:33,307
So, could it be that he was the accomplice?

264
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,307
So, it wasn't a coincidence

265
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:38,977
that he appeared at just the right timing.

266
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,979
What's wrong?

267
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:44,507
Okita! Go get everyone!

268
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:48,107
He did so, to keep me away from Mr. Miyasaka.

269
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,007
Then, Mr. Takayama is the culprit after all?

270
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,107
No.

271
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:56,995
Mr. Takayama couldn't have killed Mr. Miyasaka.

272
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:02,007
Because the crime was committed not after the video was recorded

273
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:04,007
and we returned to the room

274
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:07,005
after hearing that Mr. Miyasaka was dead.

275
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,907
But between the time we left Mr. Miyasaka's room

276
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:13,507
and Mr. Kurahashi went inside the room the second time.

277
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:18,407
During that time, we were all in the lobby.

278
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:20,807
With the exception of one person.

279
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,021
Yes.

280
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,107
The one who could've committed the crime at that time...

281
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:29,407
Miki, I think you should go back to your room and rest.

282
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:30,707
All right.

283
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,707
Excuse me.

284
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:36,807
Is none other than you, Miki!

285
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,037
When you told Mr. Miyasaka and Mr. Takayama

286
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,039
about your candid camera video plan,

287
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,043
they both though it was interesting and agreed to it.

288
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:48,307
So, just as you planned,

289
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:51,807
since we thought that Mr. Miyasaka was murdered,

290
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:55,407
we sealed the room off.

291
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,907
After everyone left, you went back to Mr. Miyasaka's room.

292
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,707
Then, Mr. Miyasaka who was still alive opened the door

293
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:08,307
and let Miki in.

294
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:10,107
If it went according as planned,

295
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:11,707
they were both going to appear before everyone

296
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:15,507
and disclose what happened.

297
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:27,607
But, this time, he was stabbed in the chest with one blow.

298
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,089
After lying the dead body in exactly the same position as before,

299
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,091
Miki left the room.

300
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:37,507
The door is auto locked, so it will lock itself as before.

301
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,407
This way, you acquired a definite alibi for you alone.

302
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,107
Then, you mean Mr. Takayama was...

303
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,607
Mr. Takayama probably thought it strange

304
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:55,107
that Mr. Miyasaka didn't appear to disclose the trick.

305
00:18:55,107 --> 00:19:00,107
I guess you all noticed that he seemed jittery and bothered.

306
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:04,207
If Mr. Takayama finds out that Mr. Miyasaka was really killed,

307
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:07,907
Miki's alibi trick would be revealed.

308
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:12,107
That's why she called Mr. Takayama out to the cliff.

309
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,107
Then she comes back to the lobby looking as if nothing had happened.

310
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:25,143
She lies and says she saw Mr. Takayama fleeing

311
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,507
and tried to set him up as the culprit.

312
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:31,807
It's not a lie! I really saw him!

313
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:33,907
There's no way you could've seen him.

314
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,607
Because even if you were to look outside in the dark

315
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,707
from this brightly lit lobby,

316
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,157
only the reflection of the inside of this room

317
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,607
would be seen on the window,

318
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:43,707
and nothing outside can possibly be in view!

319
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:57,175
Don't just sit there, say something!

320
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,907
I did it.

321
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:05,183
Miki!

322
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,807
No.

323
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:13,907
I was a nameless actress in the past.

324
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:18,307
One day, I received a really big role

325
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:22,507
as a guest on a drama that Miyasaka was starring in.

326
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:25,203
I went right away to report this

327
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,707
to my only relative, my grandmother.

328
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,307
She was ill in bed, but was very happy for me,

329
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:31,807
and was looking forward to the day

330
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:34,107
the program would be aired.

331
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,007
However...

332
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:40,107
Takayama and Miyasaka got drunk and were arrested for assault,

333
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:43,007
so the drama was cancelled.

334
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:46,107
The part that I acted wasn't aired

335
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:48,607
and my grandmother passed away.

336
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:51,607
If those two didn't cause that incident,

337
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:55,907
I would've been able to show her my performance.

338
00:20:55,907 --> 00:21:00,307
Ever since then, I never landed a big part.

339
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:03,241
And I gave up pursuing my acting career...

340
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,807
Just to think that

341
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,245
it was all due to Miyasaka and Takayama getting into trouble,

342
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,807
I couldn't forgive them.

343
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:12,407
And yet, those guys...

344
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:14,707
I'm not going to have my acting career go down the drain

345
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,255
just because of that stupid incident!

346
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,607
I'm going to go back to being a star again!

347
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:27,265
To think that the guy who shows no act of repentance

348
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,267
what so ever gets to continue being an actor as if nothing happened

349
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:32,107
while I had to give up mine

350
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,807
is just not right!

351
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:34,807
That's why...

352
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,275
Enough of your spoiled talk!

353
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:41,279
In the world of acting things are known not to go well.

354
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,307
Nevertheless, we all clench our teeth and give it all we got.

355
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:49,287
You can't land a good role before you haven't worked hard enough for it.

356
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:52,107
Whether you decide to give it up or not is all up to you.

357
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:54,107
And yet, you not only blame it on somebody else,

358
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,307
you go as far as to kill them.

359
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:58,707
So much for acting spoiled!

360
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,507
After police investigation,

361
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:39,107
the fake knife was found in Miki's room.

362
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:42,707
Oh, no. I over slept.

363
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:47,405
Hey I'm still here!

364
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:51,207
Hey, don't leave me behind.

365
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,807
Candid camera succeeds!

366
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:00,207
No joke!

367
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,000
Next Conan's Hint:

368
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,860
"Paint"

369
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,456
Flower clocks are nice.

370
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:09,427
Let's go get something to eat.

371
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,720
That's what you call a stomach clock.
