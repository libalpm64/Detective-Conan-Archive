1
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:05,168
The light of summer is the brilliance of yesterday.

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:07,168
After the tears, comes the change in life.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,668
How can a man be so unlucky?

4
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,468
An incident endangering his life occurs.

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,168
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:13,968
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:16,268
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,554
Strange.

9
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:06,854
I'm sure that the yakiniku shop was on this road somewhere.

10
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,254
It's okay already.

11
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:09,854
Let's go eat something else.

12
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:11,554
Shut up!

13
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:12,954
We're looking for it one more time.

14
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:14,054
What?

15
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:15,854
We're going to look for it again?

16
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,754
Let's go home, Pops.

17
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,954
We can't find it and it's already 6:30 pm.

18
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:23,654
It's only 6:30 pm!

19
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:27,954
I told you that I'd treat you to a luxurious meal while Ran is away.

20
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,254
It's a hit-and-run!

21
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:33,354
Hey! Hold it!

22
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,054
Somebody! Somebody call the police!

23
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,754
You idiot!

24
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,454
We need an ambulance right away!

25
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:42,654
Two passers-by have been hit by a car.

26
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:45,154
The place is at a backstreet of Beika Park.

27
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:46,254
Hurry!

28
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:50,254
He looks familiar.

29
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,354
He's the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

30
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,754
The unluckiest man in all of Japan?

31
00:02:56,754 --> 00:03:00,054
Just some time ago, a video of him taken by his nephew

32
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,154
got the "Funniest Video Award" which was aired on TV.

33
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:06,554
My uncle, Mr. Shinzaburo Tatematsu,

34
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:10,054
is probably the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

35
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:13,054
When he walks, a lot of things come falling down at him.

36
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:17,854
When he tries to avoid danger, he always sprains his ankle.

37
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,354
That hurts...

38
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:20,754
If he lines up to get something,

39
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:23,854
-it will always runs out right before of him. -I'm so sorry.

40
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,854
Why does everything bad happen to me?

41
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:39,254
And now he ends up in a traffic accident.

42
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,854
No, that's not it!

43
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,154
That's not it?

44
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:48,754
The driver was waiting for them in the car for a while there.

45
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:51,254
And the moment the driver saw those two,

46
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,554
the car charged right at them.

47
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:55,654
What?

48
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:58,854
Then, this wasn't just a mere accident.

49
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,754
It's an attempted murder case.

50
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:09,854
"Bad Luck Grand Prix"

51
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:14,154
One of the witnesses happened to remember the license plate number.

52
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,154
It seems to have been a stolen car.

53
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,054
It hasn't been found yet.

54
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:22,554
And how about the victims?

55
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,154
It seems that they're both okay.

56
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:26,454
I'm glad.

57
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,054
Can you share me the details?

58
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,354
Yes.

59
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,354
According to the eyewitness,

60
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,054
he doesn't know what the culprit looks like

61
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,754
because he's wearing a cap and sunglasses.

62
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:38,354
Mr. Tatematsu who was on his way back from work

63
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:40,254
was coming from Beika Station.

64
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:44,154
Just when he met Mr. Okonogi who was taking a walk...

65
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,954
The car in waiting suddenly ambushed them.

66
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:55,754
Who was the car after at that time? Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?

67
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,754
We don't know.

68
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:01,154
The car seems to charge at those two the instant they met each other.

69
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:04,854
Huh? Then, maybe the culprit was after them both?

70
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,754
I don't know about that.

71
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:09,754
If the culprit really wanted to go after the lives of both of them,

72
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:12,454
targeting them one by one instead of two together

73
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,054
will heighten the success rate.

74
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:15,054
True.

75
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:19,454
Only one of them was the target after all.

76
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:23,654
Then why did the culprit charge at them at such queer timing?

77
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:26,954
Doctor.

78
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:32,254
Let's confirm with the two men whether they have any idea

79
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:34,554
of anyone who could be coming after them.

80
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,554
Thank you very much.

81
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:42,054
I think we'll be able to hear what Mr. Tatematsu has to say.

82
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:44,154
But as for Mr. Okonogi...

83
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:46,154
Is uncle okay?

84
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,554
You are...

85
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:51,254
He is Mr. Kazuma Sakaki, Mr. Okonogi's nephew.

86
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:52,454
His nephew.

87
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,854
And she is his fiance.

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,554
My name is Tomomi Ichikura.

89
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:59,954
I was contacted by Kazuma and was shocked.

90
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:01,754
Thank you for coming.

91
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,054
It seems that he will be all right,

92
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:07,054
but it will take a while before he regains consciousness.

93
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,354
Who could've done such a thing to Mr. Okonogi?

94
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,854
That's right. Who on earth did it?

95
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,354
Officer Takagi.

96
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:17,554
There is something that bothers me.

97
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:20,154
It seems that Mr. Okonogi is a man of great financial standing.

98
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:24,754
However, he doesn't have any family and his only relative is his nephew.

99
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:25,954
Which means...

100
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:27,154
Yeah.

101
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:31,154
If Mr. Okonogi dies, all of his estate will go to his nephew.

102
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:32,354
Besides,

103
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:35,754
he seemed to have borrowed a lot of money from his uncle, too.

104
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:39,354
This evening at about 6:30 pm,

105
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:42,454
when Mr. Okonogi was hit by the car,

106
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,454
where were you, Mr. Sakaki?

107
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,254
-Are you suspecting me? -No way!

108
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,554
Now, now. Please calm down.

109
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:55,754
I'm sure the culprit was after the other man!

110
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:58,854
Mr. Okonogi just happened to get involved.

111
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,854
At any rate, the police have to confirm

112
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:05,854
everyone's alibi that is close to Mr. Okonogi.

113
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:09,354
Please give us your cooperation, Mr. Sakaki and Ms. Ichikura.

114
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:14,454
I was in my condo.

115
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:15,654
Huh?

116
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:17,954
Is something the matter, Ms. Ichikura?

117
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:22,754
Well, I thought he went to attend his company superior's farewell party.

118
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:24,854
I was planning to,

119
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:26,654
but I wasn't feeling too well,

120
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,754
so I took off from work in the afternoon.

121
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,754
I came home and slept right through.

122
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,454
Since I live alone, I have no one to verify this though.

123
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:38,754
And will you tell us where you were too, Ms. Ichikura?

124
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:39,954
What?

125
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:40,954
Yes.

126
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:45,754
I was window shopping at Tohto Department Store in Ginza from 5:00 pm

127
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:51,354
and I went outside to go home about 6:30 pm.

128
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,354
Were you with anyone?

129
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:54,354
No.

130
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:58,954
I was alone too, so there is no one who can confirm this.

131
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:02,054
But there was a bit of a commotion back then.

132
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:03,154
A commotion?

133
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:06,354
Yes. So I mailed Kazuma about it.

134
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,654
That's right. I remember.

135
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,754
Let's see...

136
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,954
Oh, here it is.

137
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,954
A time bomb?

138
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:21,154
Okumura, do you know about this case?

139
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,454
No. I'll go check.

140
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,854
Huh? What's this?

141
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,354
Mr. Mouri.

142
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,254
Show that to me.

143
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:32,354
"I'm at Tohto Department Store now.

144
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:36,354
They said a time bomb was found in the women's restroom on the 5th floor.

145
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:37,954
Talk about scary."

146
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,154
I see. Understood.

147
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,654
There's no doubt about it.

148
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:46,854
At about 6:30 pm, a suspicious looking thing was found in the restroom.

149
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:50,854
There was a commotion where the customers and employees were all evacuated.

150
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:53,354
It turned out to be a bad prank

151
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:56,454
and the bomb turned out to be an absolute fake, too.

152
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,054
Fake?

153
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,154
You mean that was a prank?

154
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:03,854
And it was found not in the women's restroom on the 5th floor,

155
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,854
but in the men's restroom on the 6th floor.

156
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:06,854
What?

157
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:13,654
Well, it's usual for wrong information to go around during a commotion.

158
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,254
Right...

159
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,554
Besides, it doesn't matter if it was on the 5th floor or the 6th,

160
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:20,854
or whether the bomb was a fake or not.

161
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:24,654
It's a fact that there was a bomb scare at 6:30 pm,

162
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:29,054
and she had notified him of this incident at 6:40 pm.

163
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:33,154
This means that she was there at the time.

164
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:36,254
And to get from Tohto Department Store to Beikacho,

165
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,654
it would take at least an hour even at top speed.

166
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,054
In other words...

167
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:45,054
A coincidental bomb scare established your alibi.

168
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,154
You must be a lucky woman.

169
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,354
True.

170
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,154
By the way, Mr. Sakaki,

171
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:53,554
you owe Mr. Okonogi a lot of money, don't you?

172
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:54,654
Excuse me.

173
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:59,054
You're police officers, right?

174
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,354
Mr. Tatematsu?

175
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:05,254
Then, you must be the other victim?

176
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:06,754
That car...

177
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:10,754
That car tried to run me over to shut me up.

178
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,054
Shut you up?

179
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:13,654
What?

180
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,054
The day before yesterday was pay day.

181
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:19,054
I thought I'd go out once in a while and went to a supermarket nearby.

182
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:22,054
I bought expensive meat and sashimi.

183
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,354
However, as soon as I went outside,

184
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:25,754
I was mugged.

185
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:30,154
Afer that, I tried to go after the culprit...

186
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:37,054
and I broke my front teeth.

187
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,554
Talk about one disaster after the other.

188
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,754
You really are an unlucky guy.

189
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:45,854
I knew you looked familiar.

190
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,454
You appeared on TV once as the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

191
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:53,954
Yeah, everybody was watching it.

192
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:57,154
But that isn't the end of the story yet.

193
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:00,354
Last night, I received a call from that mugger.

194
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:03,054
How dare you report to the police.

195
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:06,754
I can't let you go alive since you have seen my face.

196
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,054
I'm going to shut you up forever.

197
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:12,754
Warning of murder?

198
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,854
And then today, just as the culprit warned...

199
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,954
But would a person who only mugged food,

200
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:20,754
go all out as to carry out a murder?

201
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,054
He's right.

202
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,154
But...

203
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,154
But it was the same guy!

204
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,454
The same guy?

205
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:31,954
Then, that's it.

206
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,954
The mugger tried to kill him to shut him up.

207
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,054
Yes.

208
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:38,554
Hey, I'm going to go check on uncle's condition.

209
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:39,654
Okay.

210
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,654
I wonder if this case is really that simple.

211
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:51,154
Mr. Tatematsu.

212
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:56,154
Are you acquainted with that man called Mr. Okonogi?

213
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:58,354
I didn't know what his name was,

214
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:01,254
but I see him there every morning.

215
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,154
I come home on the same train every day

216
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:06,954
and he also take his walks at the same time.

217
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,954
Please tell us more in detail

218
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:11,254
about the time you were mugged last night.

219
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:14,054
And also about the call you received last night.

220
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:15,054
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:17,754
Hey, we're going home!

222
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:21,054
We've figured out the culprit, so the rest is up to the police.

223
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,154
Something...

224
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,254
Something's not right.

225
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:31,154
"The next morning"

226
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:34,254
The point is the timing of the car that charged towards them.

227
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,854
If the car was actually after Mr. Tatematsu's life,

228
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,554
it would've been better to target him when he was alone.

229
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:40,954
Why did it have to be then?

230
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:42,154
Hey, kid!

231
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,254
Pops.

232
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:46,954
What do you want so early in the morning?

233
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:49,954
Kids should keep their noses out of what's not their business.

234
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:53,754
I'm going to stop over at the hospital for a while.

235
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,454
Go home, understand?

236
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,254
Did something come up?

237
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:03,554
Yeah. That unluckiest man in all of Japan was really depressed.

238
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:08,354
He felt responsible for getting Mr. Okonogi involved in the accident.

239
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,854
So I thought I'd go encourage him a bit.

240
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,654
You're nice, Pops.

241
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,354
Silly!

242
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:17,354
I'm always very nice!

243
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,654
Got him involved?

244
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:22,054
Maybe it's the other way around?

245
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:26,754
If the culprit schemed the whole thing just to make it look that way,

246
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:28,254
everything falls into place.

247
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:32,954
If so, there must be somebody who saw the culprit!

248
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,752
Mr. Tatematsu?

249
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:46,652
Yes, only for these past few days though.

250
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:49,152
Let me see...

251
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,152
Was there anyone?

252
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:52,652
I wonder if she followed Mr. Tatematsu here.

253
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:55,152
There was a suspicious looking person.

254
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:58,752
Was that person a bit short and plump?

255
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:00,052
Nope.

256
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,852
She was a beautiful lady.

257
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:03,452
A lady?

258
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,252
I thought it was his girlfriend at first,

259
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:08,952
but it's so unlike of Mr. Tatematsu.

260
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,752
A lady?

261
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:11,852
Exactly.

262
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:15,152
It was no coincidence that the bomb was found.

263
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:19,052
At about 6:30 pm, an anonymous call was received at Tohto Department Store.

264
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:21,652
The person said that a time bomb was set in the restroom.

265
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,652
Was the bomb set in the women's restroom on the 5th floor?

266
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:26,452
It's surprising you know.

267
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:29,352
We haven't made it public because it's a secret investigation.

268
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,852
It seems that a child who came shopping,

269
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,952
moved it to the men's restroom on the 6th floor out of fun,

270
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,352
unaware that it was a fake bomb.

271
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,152
So that's the story.

272
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,752
I see the entire picture now.

273
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,652
Mr. Sakaki!

274
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,752
It's the kid from yesterday.

275
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,252
How's Mr. Okonogi?

276
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:53,452
We don't know when he'll regain consciousness,

277
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:55,652
so we decided to take turns and eat our meal.

278
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:59,652
Which means, only Mr. Okonogi and Ms. Ichikura are in the room together.

279
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:01,952
What is it?

280
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:02,952
We've got to hurry!

281
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,052
What's up, kid?

282
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,052
Hey, hold it!

283
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:13,952
The case has been solved?

284
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,552
You said to come right away.

285
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,652
Did I say that? Me?

286
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,752
That's why we all rushed over here.

287
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,952
If I said so but don't remember, I may have a multiple character.

288
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:25,152
I went to check!

289
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:28,852
It was just as you said, Pops!

290
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:30,852
Did I say something to you, too?

291
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,052
So, hurry!

292
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:33,152
Hey!

293
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:52,552
What are you doing?

294
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:57,452
What...

295
00:15:57,452 --> 00:16:00,352
What are you doing, Tomomi?

296
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,852
Just what is going on, Mr. Mouri?

297
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:05,252
-Mr. Mouri? -Me?

298
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:07,452
I mean, what am I supposed to say at such an unexpected situation?

299
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:13,652
The door of multiple personality is starting to open.

300
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:15,852
Did it come?

301
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,452
Ms. Ichikura.

302
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:24,052
Were you trying to make it look as if he had difficulty breathing

303
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:27,852
after drowning him with that wet towel?

304
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:33,352
Because you failed to kill him after the hit-and-run yesterday.

305
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:38,852
But as to yesterday's case, Ms. Ichikura has an alibi.

306
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:42,852
The one who came charging with the car is the one who mugged me.

307
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:47,952
Ms. Ichikura planned all this out.

308
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:54,152
To begin with, the person the culprit was after is Mr. Okonogi.

309
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:56,052
What?

310
00:16:56,052 --> 00:17:00,452
Mr. Tatematsu, you were exploited by the culprit.

311
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,052
I was exploited?

312
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,852
Ms. Ichikura schemed to kill Mr. Okonogi.

313
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,352
But with just a simple murder plan,

314
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:12,252
she knew she could fall under suspicion.

315
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,652
She was thinking of a good way to work things out

316
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,852
and began watching Mr. Okonogi's daily life.

317
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:27,452
She finds out that he always passes by Mr. Tatematsu while taking a walk.

318
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:31,552
Ms. Ichikura remembered Mr. Tatematsu's face.

319
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,552
He was the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

320
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,052
She had seen him on TV.

321
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,252
At that time,

322
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:43,852
Ms. Ichikura probably thought up this plan of exploiting Mr. Tatematsu.

323
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,752
So she followed him.

324
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,152
She may have known his face from watching him on TV,

325
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,452
but she didn't know his name.

326
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,952
In order to find out, she...

327
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,552
I made Conan go and confirm it.

328
00:17:57,552 --> 00:18:00,352
It turns out that a person living in the same apartment remembered it.

329
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:04,852
She said a suspicious lady followed him on his way home from work.

330
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,352
You carried out your plan.

331
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,952
First, you mugged Mr. Tatematsu.

332
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,252
Was that you?

333
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,052
The following day,

334
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,452
you got his phone number from his name and address

335
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:20,552
and called Mr. Tatematsu to warn him that you'd kill him to shut him up.

336
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,852
Then you chose yesterday to carry out the crime

337
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,452
because you knew that Mr. Sakaki was going to a farewell party

338
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:30,452
and would have a definite alibi, so he wouldn't be suspected.

339
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:33,152
You put a fake time bomb in the women's restroom

340
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,552
on the 5th floor of the Tohto Department Store.

341
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,752
After that, you rushed over to Beikacho.

342
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:47,352
Just as you warned, you executed your plan of fake killing Mr. Tatematsu.

343
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:49,752
You made it look as if Mr. Okonogi coincidentally happened

344
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:53,652
to get involved in the accident and tried to kill him.

345
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:56,952
You called Tohto Department Store right away.

346
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:01,552
I set a time bomb in the women's restroom on the 5th floor.

347
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,652
If you don't hurry, it'll explode.

348
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,152
You sent your fiance the mail

349
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:09,352
just about the time you figured the bomb would be found

350
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:11,452
and a commotion would be taking place.

351
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,252
Isn't that right, Ms. Ichikura?

352
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:21,152
But the alibi scheme that you thought up got the better of you.

353
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,252
The contradiction between where the fake bomb was actually found

354
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,452
and the contents of your mail.

355
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:29,152
That's what concluded the suspicion towards you.

356
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,252
Tomomi.

357
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,952
Well...

358
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,152
It's all so stupid.

359
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:45,952
I wonder why it was moved from the place I put it.

360
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,152
Tomomi...

361
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:54,152
-You... -It seems that a child who came shopping moved it.

362
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:58,552
This world just isn't fair.

363
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:02,552
The bomb is moved.

364
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:05,752
The man I tried to kill is alive.

365
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:08,252
And now a famed detective comes along.

366
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,852
Maybe I'm even more unlucky than you.

367
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,452
Why'd you try to kill uncle?

368
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:15,752
Because...

369
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,652
I wanted the money.

370
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:25,652
I decided to marry you in the first place

371
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:27,552
because I figured if your rich uncle dies,

372
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:29,852
I could get a hold of his estate.

373
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:33,352
But your uncle turned out to be so alive and kicking.

374
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:36,052
I just couldn't wait for him to drop dead.

375
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,152
Money?

376
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,852
So you were just after the money to begin with!

377
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:41,352
Of course!

378
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:43,852
Otherwise, I would never go out with somebody like you.

379
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:51,452
Really...

380
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,452
So stupid.

381
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,052
Tomomi?

382
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:57,652
Uncle!

383
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:02,252
Kazuma.

384
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,752
I'll go get the doctor.

385
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:18,752
What happened, Tomomi?

386
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,552
I'm glad that you woke up.

387
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:45,452
What a horrible woman.

388
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:47,852
I think she can start off anew.

389
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,452
Huh?

390
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:52,252
I know it's strange for a jinx like me to say so.

391
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:56,952
It's true.

392
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,352
I'd like to believe so.

393
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:39,352
Beer in the morning is so delicious!

394
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,752
A re-run due to popular demand?

395
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:44,352
So here goes!

396
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:52,452
Talk about super unlucky!

397
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,352
You shouldn't laugh at others, you know.

398
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,152
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,152
"Parking validation"

400
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:52,252
I've done it.

401
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,252
What did you do?

402
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:54,752
In the next episode, it's got to be made clear, whether it's red or white.

403
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:55,952
I think you want to say, whether it's black or white.
