1
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:13,126
What?

2
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:17,826
That lady, she's been sitting in that seat

3
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:20,126
"Kyoko Takahata (35)" -since we got here.

4
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,126
What a beauty!

5
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:24,726
True.

6
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:27,226
It's been two hours already.

7
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,126
Hello.

8
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:37,726
Speaking.

9
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:40,626
What?

10
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,526
What did you say?

11
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:48,926
Are you all right?

12
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:50,426
Pardon me.

13
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,226
Is something wrong?

14
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,726
If it's okay with you, please tell me about it.

15
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:57,726
My name is Kogoro Mouri.

16
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:00,126
Oh? You're that great detective?

17
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,726
That's right!

18
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:05,526
Actually, I just got a call from the police.

19
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:07,926
Someone has died in my home.

20
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:09,826
What was that?

21
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,426
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

22
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,426
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

23
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,326
Today's case is pretty tough.

24
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:20,326
What's the crime that cannot be proven?

25
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,226
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,126
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,126
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

28
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:12,932
"The Crime with Zero Possibility to be Proven"

29
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,532
"Takahata"

30
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:24,032
The deceased is Itsuro Soejima, 27 years old.

31
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,332
He is the husband of Shiori, whose sister,

32
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,432
Kyoko Takahata, is the owner of this house.

33
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:37,132
These are a fallen chandelier and a shotgun.

34
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:40,532
Looks like the gun accidentally went off.

35
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,332
Is something wrong?

36
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:53,732
No. It's nothing.

37
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,632
And to our surprise...

38
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,332
Sorry, I'm late.

39
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:02,632
What took you so long, Chiba?

40
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:04,632
I apologize.

41
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:09,332
Soejima? This can't be!

42
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,532
The victim was actually officer Chiba's friend back in college.

43
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:16,032
What happened here?

44
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:18,032
His shotgun suddenly discharged,

45
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:21,232
causing the chandelier to fall and crash on his head.

46
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,432
What's the estimated time of death?

47
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,432
Approximately an hour ago.

48
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,332
In other words,

49
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:31,632
he entered the house by himself while she was out.

50
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:34,032
He consumed alcohol to the point of getting drunk,

51
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:36,632
grabbed the shotgun from the cabinet

52
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:38,332
and loaded the gun.

53
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:41,932
While he was fooling around with it, it went off.

54
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,932
No way.

55
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:45,832
So Itsuro really...

56
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:48,032
I was worried that

57
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:50,232
something like this would happen.

58
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,232
What do you mean?

59
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:55,232
I don't want to say this...

60
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:59,232
Itsurou would start new business after business and fail,

61
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,332
going into further debt.

62
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,532
He caused my little sister Shiori to suffer.

63
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:07,232
However, he continued drinking

64
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:10,132
and caused more trouble to those around him.

65
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:13,532
When my sister died of an illness half a year ago,

66
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,132
his drinking problem worsened.

67
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,232
He would even go to the fitness club

68
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:20,332
and shooting range I introduced him to, wasted on alcohol.

69
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:23,832
-Please stop it. -I said let go, let go!

70
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:34,032
In the end, the club expelled him,

71
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:36,732
and his gun license was revoked.

72
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,732
Since then, it seemed he wanted to get his hands on my gun.

73
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:43,632
So that's why he snuck into your house when you were out,

74
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,132
and ended up like he did.

75
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,132
No way...

76
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:50,032
It's true that he was a drunkard,

77
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:52,332
and he even consulted me about it.

78
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:56,532
But, he said he was going to quit drinking alcohol.

79
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:59,932
He wanted to quit, but he just couldn't.

80
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:01,632
No... no way.

81
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,732
I heard about the incident at the shooting range.

82
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:05,832
He swore saying that

83
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,532
he would never ever touch a gun again!

84
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:11,332
He was blinded by alcohol and simply forgot about it.

85
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:12,732
That can't be it.

86
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:15,832
If he saw these delicious dishes lying around here,

87
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:18,832
I'll bet he'd start to crave a drink.

88
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:23,132
It's true that these dishes all go well with alcohol.

89
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,232
Hey, brat, cut out your smart aleck remarks!

90
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,132
He apparently took the dishes

91
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,132
I had prepared beforehand out of the fridge on his own.

92
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:35,432
I guess I'm to be held responsible too.

93
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,832
No, that's not it.

94
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,132
Ran!

95
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,332
Conan, shouldn't bother them.

96
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,732
But, where is the key?

97
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,132
The key?

98
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:47,232
Since she was out, how did this manage to get in?

99
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:50,532
I don't see any traces of the windows or doors being forced open.

100
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,732
He carried a spare key, perhaps?

101
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,032
That must be it!

102
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:56,732
But I don't see any spare key, anywhere.

103
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,532
And not only that

104
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:02,532
I don't see this man's wallet or cell phone.

105
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:05,232
Hey! Stop messing around!

106
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:08,032
The spare key is outside the entrance.

107
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:11,332
I told him where it was hidden too.

108
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,832
What about where you store the bullets and your shotgun?

109
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:16,332
I'm pretty sure I had all the doors locked.

110
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,632
-How about it? -Well, it's old

111
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:21,632
and the locks don't seem to be working so well.

112
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,732
If it's like this, anyone can easily open the doors.

113
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:28,132
If any case, an insecure cabinet such as that doesn't meet

114
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:32,032
the standards of the metropolis firearm storage law!

115
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,532
Be prepared to have your license revoked

116
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:36,532
and any punishment that will come along with it.

117
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,132
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:42,132
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

119
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,032
But viewing it from a different angle,

120
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,832
that's all she would have to take on,

121
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,732
despite the fact that someone had died because of it.

122
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:50,432
As for this case, we'll deem it an accident

123
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,832
and let the jurisdictional precinct handle it.

124
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:55,832
Please wait! I still can't believe this!

125
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,032
But look...

126
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:58,932
Let's investigate a little further!

127
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:01,332
Chiba! Calm yourself down!

128
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,132
It's an accident no matter how you look at it!

129
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,132
But...

130
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,732
Knock it off already!

131
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:08,832
Go outside and cool down!

132
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,132
It's understandable to react like that

133
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,432
when your friend dies, but...

134
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:25,632
Say, what were you doing at the cafe terrace?

135
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:26,832
What?

136
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:31,432
For over two hours, were you waiting for something?

137
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:34,732
I wasn't waiting for anything.

138
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,132
Really?

139
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,132
Knock it off now!

140
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,832
You go cool yourself down too!

141
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:57,332
What's this?

142
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:01,932
That is from Soejima's cell phone strap.

143
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,132
Really?

144
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:05,532
Yeah, it's a matching strap

145
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,232
with the one the late Shiori was using.

146
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:10,232
But there wasn't any cell phone at the scene.

147
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:14,032
Say, can you tell me something?

148
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,732
Soejima's personality?

149
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:24,332
When it came to sports, I was only good at judo,

150
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,932
but he was good at all of them.

151
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:31,132
At the same time, he couldn't really handle much pressure though.

152
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:35,632
It seemed he began relieving his stress from work, by drinking.

153
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:37,832
Perhaps the trouble he caused

154
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:41,732
wasn't just at the shooting range and the pool?

155
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:45,132
Maybe we should go check out the details

156
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,232
a bit more, don't you think?

157
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:48,732
I see.

158
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:52,432
With some luck, maybe we can uncover some new facts.

159
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,132
Okay. Let's go.

160
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:58,632
During our investigation,

161
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,832
we uncovered more of his similar troublesome incidents.

162
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,432
Drunk driving.

163
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:05,332
If it weren't for the guard rail,

164
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:09,332
the car would have gone over the edge, he would've been dead.

165
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,132
That was a month ago.

166
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:15,932
And two months ago...

167
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:20,332
He got drunk and collapsed on the street in the cold winter weather.

168
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:23,032
He would've frozen to death if he had been found any later than he was.

169
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,432
Adding up these similar accidents and incidents,

170
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:30,232
there are a total of nine of them over a span of 6 months.

171
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:34,632
After Shiori's death, Soejima became very depressed.

172
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:37,832
It's true that, for a while his alcohol consumption increased,

173
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:41,032
but he would always say "I'm going to quit for real this time".

174
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:44,132
Then, just as he was getting better,

175
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:46,232
he would relapse once again.

176
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:50,032
This happened over and over again for half a year.

177
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,832
Maybe Mr. Mouri's right,

178
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:56,332
he wanted to quit, but he just couldn't.

179
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:59,332
Still, he was a fortunate guy.

180
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,332
He was just a brother-in-law to her, and yet,

181
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,732
all the fines and compensation for the accidents he caused,

182
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:06,332
as well as someone to take custody of him,

183
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,732
were all taken care of by Kyoko.

184
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:12,532
She was also the one who introduced him to the shooting range

185
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:15,232
and fitness club where he caused trouble

186
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,532
as well as the owner of the house with shotguns

187
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:19,032
kept in an insecure cabinet,

188
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:21,832
plus the owner of a house he could access using a spare key.

189
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:27,632
Say, do you know what "indirect intent" means?

190
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:30,132
Indirect Intent?

191
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,932
Indirect intent is when a person foresees

192
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:36,332
that an action is likely to result in a harmful outcome,

193
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,832
but disregards whether it's ensured or not,

194
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,332
and follows through with the action regardless.

195
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:47,132
Of course I know that.

196
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:51,532
But Conan, I'm surprised that you know something like that.

197
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:57,332
Well, I heard about it from Pop Kogoro a while ago.

198
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,732
Despite foreseeing that a drunkard like Soejima

199
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:04,032
might get himself killed under the influence,

200
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:07,332
she still allows him to drive a car,

201
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,732
inviting him to go to a shooting range and swimming pool.

202
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:10,932
Moreover, she left the house

203
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:14,032
and allowed him to come, drink, and carry a gun.

204
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:16,832
He may die, or he may not die...

205
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:20,232
the possibility wasn't 100%, but it wasn't zero, either.

206
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,332
If the culprit bet on that then...

207
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:25,332
Don't tell me...

208
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:36,468
Conan, I've borrowed the keys.

209
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:39,968
But I think we ought to tell Mr. Mouri and the inspector first.

210
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,068
Never mind, just hurry it up.

211
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,968
Conan.

212
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,168
This room is...

213
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,868
It's dark. Where's the switch?

214
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,468
Oh, wait.

215
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:02,168
It was the cell phone recharging indicator light.

216
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,268
Recharging?

217
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:06,268
Say, whose cell phone is this?

218
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:09,668
That is Shiori's cell phone.

219
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:13,968
Soejima didn't want Shiori's cell phone date to be deleted,

220
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,268
so he constantly recharged it.

221
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,768
Hang on,

222
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:21,768
this room should've been vacant for at least half a day.

223
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,068
Don't tell me, someone entered this room a couple of minutes ago

224
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,468
and used the cell phone?

225
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:29,968
What did you say? Who would do that?

226
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,468
Looks like someone really was here.

227
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:36,168
It looks like whoever it was searched the room.

228
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:38,268
Could it be a cat burglar?

229
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,168
If that's the case, whoever it was

230
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,468
wouldn't have re-locked the door, right?

231
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:43,068
That's true, but...

232
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:46,268
Not long ago, I received a report from my transceiver

233
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:47,968
saying that a cat burglar frequenting this neighborhood

234
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,868
was arrested at Beika Station.

235
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,468
Wait, don't tell me...

236
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:54,568
What's this?

237
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,768
There's something that looks like glitter.

238
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,168
What?

239
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,168
This is...

240
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,668
So that's how it was.

241
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:10,868
What's this about, Mr. Mouri?

242
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:13,768
Are you suspecting me for something?

243
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:17,768
No. It's not like that...

244
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,368
Hey, Chiba!

245
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:22,968
What's this about? Calling us here all of a sudden?

246
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:24,268
Explain yourself.

247
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:26,968
That... that is to say well, that

248
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:31,568
the culprit of this incident is you, Ms. Kyoko Takahata.

249
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:34,468
What... what did you say?

250
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,368
Further... further explanations

251
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:39,068
will be given by Mr. Mouri, according to Conan.

252
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:42,568
Huh? Something like that. I never...

253
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:49,568
All right, let me explain.

254
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,268
Disregard what I said earlier.

255
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:56,568
I do suspect you. I think it was you who killed Soejima.

256
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,868
I killed Itsuro?

257
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:02,668
This had been planned for over half a year.

258
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,568
No, as long as the plan succeeds,

259
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,268
it doesn't matter how long it would take.

260
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,868
It was a long-range murder plan.

261
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,868
A perfect murder based on indirect intent!

262
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:16,768
Knowing that Mr. Soejima was an alcoholic.

263
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:18,668
You created numerous situations

264
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,368
where he could get himself accidentally killed.

265
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:23,568
Then, all you had to do is wait.

266
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:27,468
Right, while sitting in a cafe terrace, drinking.

267
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,168
That's interesting. Sounds like the plot of a movie or a novel.

268
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:32,768
But do you have evidence?

269
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,868
Evidence, you ask?

270
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,868
It's about time for the first piece of evidence,

271
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:40,268
rather, a witness to arrive.

272
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,668
A witness?

273
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:44,368
Chiba, I forced Beika Station to cooperate

274
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:46,268
and brought him here!

275
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,368
Thank you.

276
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:49,768
I heard nothing about this!

277
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,268
Ah, sorry.

278
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:55,568
Mr. Mouri told me to assist Chiba with this.

279
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,268
"Naoya Nishitani (37)" -This man is Naoya Nishitani.

280
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:00,368
He is a recurring cat burglar

281
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:01,968
who was arrested by the Beika police yesterday.

282
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,468
A cat burglar?

283
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:07,468
Yes, he broke into this house yesterday,

284
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,268
and watched the incident take place.

285
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,768
What was that?

286
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:15,068
Now, tell us again about the testimony you gave.

287
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:18,968
Like I said, when I was rummaging around on the second floor,

288
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:23,168
when that guy suddenly came in.

289
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,368
It's Itsuro.

290
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,168
Sis?

291
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:33,268
What's she up to, calling me all the way out here, and yet...

292
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:40,068
No, I can't. I can't drink...

293
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,668
This can't be.

294
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,968
Soon he drunk himself into a stupor

295
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:00,568
and took the gun out of the cabinet.

296
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:02,368
Just as I thought it was bad.

297
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,368
Every bit of it was being set up.

298
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,668
Having her license revoked because of improper storage,

299
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:23,768
is of no concern at this point.

300
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,568
This is nothing more than genuine homicide.

301
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:29,968
Please hold it! It's just his side of the story, isn't it?

302
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,468
Who do you trust, me or that burglar?

303
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,768
Aren't you concerned about the whereabouts

304
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:38,368
of Mr. Soejima's cell phone?

305
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:42,168
Back then, you were trying to find something.

306
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:45,468
That something was Mr. Soejima's cell phone.

307
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,968
You wanted to delete...

308
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:51,168
What's she up to? Calling me all the way here. And yet...

309
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:54,968
What you used to call Mr. Soejima here,

310
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:57,968
the data of your text message!

311
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:02,168
Last night, you went into Mr. Soejima's room

312
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,968
and tried to find the cell phone, right?

313
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,968
What're you saying?

314
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:10,968
That's some impressive nail art.

315
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:15,568
But, is every piece of them there? The rhinestones.

316
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:18,468
Chiba.

317
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,968
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:23,068
This was found on the floor near Shiori's cell phone.

319
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:27,268
It was the same thing as your nail decoration, isn't it?

320
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,768
And the cell phone?

321
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:34,468
Well, about that...

322
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,168
After pulling out the money from the wallet,

323
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:39,068
he threw the whole pouch into the river.

324
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:42,168
The data was damaged, impossible to recover.

325
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:45,268
No... no way.

326
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:48,368
What a shame, you couldn't get your evidence.

327
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:52,568
But regardless, there wasn't such a message in the first place.

328
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:57,668
What I was trying to find was not the message you sent.

329
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:02,968
But, rather, Shiori's cell phone, which you touched.

330
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:04,568
Even after her death,

331
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:07,968
Mr. Soejima kept recharging the phone

332
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:09,668
and cherished it.

333
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:14,968
To him, Shiori still seemed to be alive.

334
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:17,668
Stop... stop talking nonsense!

335
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:20,668
That man caused Shiori indescribable pain!

336
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:23,468
He deserved to die for all I care!

337
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:26,968
Now, we're finally getting to hear how you really felt.

338
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:30,868
So what? Are you arresting me?

339
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:33,168
I'm a private detective.

340
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:36,768
I can neither arrest nor sentence you.

341
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:40,968
A private detective's job is merely to find the truth.

342
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:46,468
This time I found how your younger sister felt.

343
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:50,268
Shiori's feelings?

344
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:55,768
You got mail. It's okay, ust go ahead and pick it up.

345
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,168
Excuse me.

346
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,968
No... no way.

347
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,968
"Message Log: To Itsurou"

348
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:11,468
It's probably a message from heaven.

349
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,368
Why don't you read on?

350
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:18,168
I'm sorry, Itsuro...

351
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:20,568
I know we've got to work on this together.

352
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:23,068
We've got to hold on, and yet, I allowed illness to defeat me.

353
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,668
When I get well, promise me that you'll stand on your own feet

354
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,968
and apologize to my older sister.

355
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:31,168
Don't worry, I know she'll understand.

356
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,868
Because she's really kind

357
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:36,368
and the only sister I have.

358
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,368
Shiori...

359
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,868
Could this be?

360
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:46,668
Before she died, Shiori sent this message to Mr. Soejima.

361
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:50,768
All I did was send you the saved message stored inside

362
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,368
Shiori's cell phone.

363
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,668
-Conan. -Here!

364
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:57,468
I'm sorry if I surprised you.

365
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,468
Since this was Shiori's cell phone,

366
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,068
you didn't check it detail, did you? Yesterday.

367
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:09,668
However, in the end, Shiori died of an illness.

368
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,368
Without knowing Shiori's true feelings,

369
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:18,068
you began your plan to murder Mr. Soejima.

370
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,368
It's a lie!

371
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:23,568
Shiori couldn't have... I'm sure she hated that guy.

372
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:27,468
Mr. Soejima truly wanted to stand on his own feet.

373
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,968
If you hadn't let anger control you,

374
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:35,168
you could've seen it as well. His feelings and Shiori's wish!

375
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,968
It's up to you from here on now.

376
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:40,368
After you've learned of Shiori's feelings,

377
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,868
will you still turn a blind eye to what you did,

378
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,668
and lie to her constantly for the remainder of your life

379
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,368
or...

380
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:52,268
Shiori.

381
00:21:56,768 --> 00:22:00,268
Kyoko Takahata confessed everything.

382
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:03,868
However, about how the law

383
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,668
will sentence her crime of "Indirect Intent",

384
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:08,968
will still be a long way from now.

385
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:33,651
"Detective Mouri Agency" -Wait, what are you doing, Dad?

386
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:37,751
I've come to realize that soaking myself in alcohol is unhealthy.

387
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,751
So, by putting beer in front of me,

388
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,151
I'm training myself to resist the temptation.

389
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:44,351
I can't do it!

390
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:57,451
Resisting too much will only cause stress!

391
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,520
Next Conan's Hint:

392
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,520
Stairs

393
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,800
Next time we'll be the main characters...

394
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,380
Conan won't be there at all.
- Yeah, right...

395
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,940
It's true!
