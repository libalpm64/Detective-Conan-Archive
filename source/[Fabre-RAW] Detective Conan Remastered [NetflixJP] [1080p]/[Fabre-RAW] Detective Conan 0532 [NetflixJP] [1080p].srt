1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,983
All the horses have turned the final corner!

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,133
The last 200 meters,

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,133
-which one's going to come out front? -Come...

4
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,533
-Will it be the favorite Iron Blade? -Come...

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,991
Please, come!

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,995
For the sake of the future of the Mouri Detective Agency!

7
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,633
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

8
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,001
Saturday nights are for mystery.

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
The clue is a large scar.

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,333
Make sure to choose your first love and not the suspect.

11
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,007
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,733
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,733
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

14
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:19,054
"The Scar of First Love"

15
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:21,554
Half of Iron Blade's head in lane four is in the lead!

16
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:22,854
From outside in lane 6 is Masked Yaiba!

17
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:24,123
-From inside in lane 8 is Black Chaser! -Come...

18
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,754
-It's Devil Typhoon in lane 2! Its come up front! -Come...

19
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:29,154
-Devil Typhoon... It's Devil Typhoon! -Come...

20
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:32,131
It's over! Devil Typhoon in lane 2 is the winner!

21
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,054
There is a loud stir among the spectators...

22
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:35,554
-at this much too unexpected result! -It's come!

23
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,654
No way! You won?

24
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:40,139
Yeah! Super dark horse, 3 million yen!

25
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,154
3 million?

26
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:46,454
God was watching over this agency

27
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,454
and knew that we were having in tough this month.

28
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:52,151
We had practically no clients last month.

29
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:55,454
Hold it. The re-judge lamp is on!

30
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:59,154
Did something happen during the final heated competition?

31
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,354
Oh, my. Devil Typhoon in lane 2 slanted out of line

32
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,954
and has been disqualified.

33
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,554
The order of the horses making goal has changed,

34
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:05,554
and the winner is Iron Blade in lane 4!

35
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:09,554
Isn't God on the side of the needy?

36
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:14,454
Come to think of it, just the other day

37
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:16,754
I heard on the news that a girl of a prestigious family

38
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:21,454
bought a lottery ticket just for fun and won 1 billion yen!

39
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,754
What?

40
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,183
And she was saying that

41
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,754
she was planning to give that winning ticket to somebody.

42
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,154
Something about when she was a child and on a trip,

43
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:31,654
she got into a traffic accident.

44
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:32,654
And she wants the boy who was badly wounded

45
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:34,193
after trying to protect her to come out front,

46
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,554
so that she can thank him

47
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:38,754
and give him the 1 million as a token of her gratitude.

48
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:42,201
And? Did that lucky boy appear?

49
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,254
I wonder...

50
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:45,954
That girl who was also hurt in that accident

51
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:47,954
has lost her sight because of it.

52
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:50,209
She said that since that boy was still a child too,

53
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,354
she can't tell if it's him from his face or voice.

54
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:57,254
Then, how is she going to be able to tell if it's really that boy or not?

55
00:03:57,254 --> 00:04:00,219
It seems that the scar he got during the accident is the key!

56
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,854
She says that since it was a big scar,

57
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:05,654
the scar should still be there even after he grows up.

58
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:08,227
I also have a scar.

59
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,954
The scar on my shoulder I got when I played sandlot baseball

60
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,054
and did a head slide 2 years ago!

61
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:15,554
Do you think I can fake it through with this?

62
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,754
Fake it?

63
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:20,239
Hey, hey. Come off it, old man.

64
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,654
It's not on his shoulder.

65
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:33,154
I remember clearly that his t-shirt was slashed in a straight line

66
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:36,255
and blood came seeping out.

67
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:42,254
After that, my eyesight started to fail,

68
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:45,354
but I haven't forgotten what I saw back then.

69
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:48,254
She's the person, you know the 1 billion yen.

70
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,754
Which means you want me to use the scar as a clue

71
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:54,854
and find that boy for you?

72
00:04:55,954 --> 00:05:00,754
A person saying that he's the one has appeared.

73
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,954
But there are two of them.

74
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:05,354
Two?

75
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:08,754
I see.

76
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:14,554
So, you want me to figure out which is the real one?

77
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,554
Yes.

78
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:19,554
Because the person who saved me back then was alone.

79
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:23,154
Which means that one of them is an imposter.

80
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:25,454
How dare he pose as the boy of your memory

81
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:27,254
just because he wants the money.

82
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,354
What a jerk.

83
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,254
Talk for yourself...

84
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:35,254
And, did you see the scars of the two?

85
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:38,854
Yes, sir. I did take a look at it.

86
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:45,154
But the man with the brown hair has a scar on his back

87
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:48,327
and the tanned man has one on his chest.

88
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,329
They each have a large scar for sure.

89
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,154
Huh? On the back and chest?

90
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:57,454
You don't know where the scar is supposed to be, Ms.?

91
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:59,654
No. All I remember is that

92
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:03,854
the scar was a big one that extended from one side to the other.

93
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:06,345
By the way, where did the accident occur?

94
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:11,054
It was during summer vacation some 30 years ago.

95
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,353
I went on vacation with my parents to Izu.

96
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,854
I became friends with the boy

97
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,254
who looked to be the same age as I at the beach,

98
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,354
and played with him practically every day.

99
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:25,554
He was very knowledgeable about the ocean and fish

100
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:28,367
and always drank ginger ale.

101
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,369
His white teeth against his tanned face

102
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,654
that showed at times were fantastic

103
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:35,054
that I fell in love at first sight.

104
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:40,754
However, those dream-like days didn't last for long.

105
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,381
When I cried saying that I didn't want to go home

106
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,054
on the last day of summer vacation,

107
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:50,854
he said, "Stay here, then! I'll protect you."

108
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:54,393
How old were you back then?

109
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,395
I think I was in the 2nd grade of elementary school.

110
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:59,954
Lovey-dovey in 2nd grade of elementary.

111
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:02,754
And? How did you get into a traffic accident?

112
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,754
I begged my parents to let me stay

113
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:08,407
just one more day in Izu and they approved.

114
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,154
I wanted to tell him about this

115
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:13,354
and ran over to him, who was walking along the coast.

116
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,754
But, just then a driver who fell asleep at the wheels

117
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:18,054
came towards us and we were hit.

118
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:24,423
After that, I was unconscious for 3 days.

119
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,754
And I was sleeping on the hospital bed when I got up.

120
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:32,754
Then, you don't know what happened to that boy after that, do you?

121
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:33,954
No.

122
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,435
Although I heard that the boy, despite being badly wounded himself,

123
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:41,454
carried me all the way to the hospital.

124
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:43,254
He seems to have left

125
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,554
after saying that he would bring his parents along,

126
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:47,854
but he never came back since.

127
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:51,054
But you at least know what his name is, don't you?

128
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,453
After all, you played with him practically every day.

129
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:55,954
Gari!

130
00:07:55,954 --> 00:08:00,154
I saw you on TV saying that he told you to call him Gari

131
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,454
because all his classmates called him that, right?

132
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:03,554
Yes.

133
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:06,465
Gari gives us no clue to what his name is.

134
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,469
And, where are the two that appeared saying they the ones?

135
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,254
The two have been staying over at our place since the other day.

136
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:19,954
What a grand mansion!

137
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:23,554
With a place so big, I'll bet cleaning this place is tough too?

138
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:26,485
Yes. Mr. Hoya and two maids

139
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,487
are doing what they can to maintain the place.

140
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:32,491
But since there are only four of us living here including me,

141
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,454
we don't mess the place up much either.

142
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:38,954
Nah, I'm sure it's tough getting rid of dust here too.

143
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:42,501
Four of you? Your parents?

144
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,954
My mother died early because of an illness.

145
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,154
And my father who was looking after me all this time

146
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:50,054
also died 3 years ago because of the same illness.

147
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:53,454
Just before father passed away,

148
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:57,754
Mr. Hoya was hired as the butler and forced to look after me.

149
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:01,154
No, it's not that he forced you on me.

150
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:05,454
Well... now, including the two men that have come,

151
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:08,054
including all too, it makes 9.

152
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:13,454
It looks like we're going to be having a gay dinner tonight.

153
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,537
So good, so good!

154
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,854
Having a meal with a lot of people is cheerful after all.

155
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,454
I wonder.

156
00:09:25,454 --> 00:09:29,954
It seems that there's at least one person who's not fit to be here.

157
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,154
Huh?

158
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:36,954
Maybe it's about time you come out and identify yourself, imposter.

159
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:40,254
That's my line, you jerk!

160
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,854
Well, as to that, I'm sure Mr. Mouri will see through

161
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:45,454
who the imposter is a while later.

162
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,254
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

163
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,854
Well, for the time being,

164
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,354
I would like to hear you all out one at a time in another room.

165
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,254
See you, Mr. Detective.

166
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,579
-See you later. -Yeah.

167
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,954
Please check them over thoroughly.

168
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,754
Both of them could be imposters too, you know.

169
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:08,854
Yeah.

170
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:12,054
After all, it's something that happened 30 years ago.

171
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:16,054
It could be that the boy is no longer here in this world, too.

172
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,597
No! He's here!

173
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,654
That person is unmistakably in this house!

174
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,254
I couldn't help feeling that way,

175
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:27,854
so that's why I called the famous Detective Mouri over here!

176
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,454
I'm a bit tired.

177
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:34,254
I'm going to my room and rest a while.

178
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:38,254
Please let me know as soon as you get the results.

179
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,554
Yes.

180
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:50,629
Don't tell me that she already knows

181
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:53,954
which of the two is the one she's looking for.

182
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,954
Hey, Conan.

183
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,254
Conan?

184
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:01,354
What's the matter?

185
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,054
What do you see outside?

186
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,643
Don't you sense it?

187
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,154
Like somebody's watching you.

188
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,054
That kind of feeling.

189
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,954
No, I don't feel anything.

190
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:25,454
Later Pops asked the two about what happened 30 year ago.

191
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:29,654
But all they did was repeat the exact same answer over and over.

192
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,054
And it wasn't surprising that they would do so.

193
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:32,354
What?

194
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:35,754
She talked about the circumstances back then in detail

195
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,954
-on a TV interview? -Yeah.

196
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:40,954
The date of the accident, the model of the car that hit them,

197
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:43,554
including the hospital that she was hospitalized in too.

198
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:47,454
No wonder they both gave the exact same answer.

199
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:50,254
There's no way I can tell who the real guy is, then.

200
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,854
There's someone around after all.

201
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:56,695
And it's not just one or two.

202
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:59,054
Pops, please come here!

203
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,354
What the heck are we doing outside?

204
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:07,154
Who is it?

205
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:09,654
Officer Takagi and Chiba?

206
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,754
Just what're you guys doing here?

207
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:14,054
Well...

208
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:15,854
This is a stake out.

209
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,254
The suspect of 15 years ago!

210
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:22,454
15 years ago?

211
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:24,723
Did you forget, Mouri?

212
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,729
The culprit of that incident that's responsible for scarring my face.

213
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,854
Superintendent Matsumoto?

214
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,735
But, Superintendent...

215
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,754
15 years ago, Mr. Mouri just became a police detective,

216
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:42,054
so I don't think he knows about it.

217
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,354
I see.

218
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,454
But, Superintendent...

219
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:50,154
I think you already had that scar when I was appointed here.

220
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:53,654
Yeah, this scar was made 5 years earlier

221
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:57,054
with the same sword that the culprit flung.

222
00:12:57,054 --> 00:13:00,154
Which makes it... 20 years ago.

223
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,554
I cornered the culprit alone at a certain pier.

224
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:06,054
He took a slash at me so I grabbed the sword

225
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,767
and swung it at him instead.

226
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,554
I slashed his body in one straight line!

227
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,354
In one straight line...

228
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:17,454
Then, don't tell me that...

229
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:21,854
Yes, I saw her on the news the other day,

230
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,054
and figured that it's possible that

231
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:25,554
the culprit would come here to show his scar.

232
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,854
That's why I came here.

233
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:29,954
And, where did you slash the culprit with the sword?

234
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:31,954
In the back or on the chest?

235
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,793
The thing is, I don't remember clearly.

236
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:37,654
I undoubtedly slashed him though.

237
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:39,454
Is that so?

238
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,054
You too?

239
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,354
Well, it seems that back then

240
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:47,354
Superintendent was wounded in the left eye and felt a bit faint.

241
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:50,354
But it seems as though, I was right to have come here.

242
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,054
Huh?

243
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:55,654
It's throbbing with pain. This scar on my left eye.

244
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:01,854
As if it's telling me that the culprit is in this house.

245
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,825
What?

246
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:10,468
The serial killer of 15 years ago is in this house?

247
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,833
He may be here, that is.

248
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,768
Then, the thing Conan was saying a while ago

249
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,868
about feeling like being watched by somebody...

250
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,768
They were the police.

251
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:23,168
Something about Superintendent Matsumoto

252
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:25,568
is pursuing that culprit right through.

253
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:30,168
That killer is also the one who scarred Superintendent's face.

254
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:34,168
But I hear that Superintendent back then grabbed the culprit's sword

255
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:38,368
and slashed a straight line across his body, too.

256
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:40,859
In a straight line... Don't tell me...

257
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:44,168
Yeah, the same scar is supposed to be

258
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,768
on the serial killer's body too.

259
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,468
A very big sword slash

260
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:49,368
extending from one side of the body to the other.

261
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:53,368
But why would a murderer come to this house?

262
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:57,268
The culprit's after the 1 billion yen that the lady won!

263
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:00,568
Using the scar that the Superintendent left on his body to his advantage!

264
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,268
In other words,

265
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,368
either the man with the brown hair, Mr. Kusumoto

266
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:07,968
or the tanned man Mr. Banba, is the person she's looking for.

267
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:12,368
And whichever is not, may turn out to be the serial killer.

268
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:17,168
And, just where on the body is the scar of the killer?

269
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:18,897
If I remember correctly, Mr. Kusumoto's scar is on his back

270
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,568
and Mr. Banba's is on his chest.

271
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:25,768
The thing is, the Superintendent says he doesn't remember very clearly

272
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:29,368
because it was right after he was hurt in the eye.

273
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:32,368
You mean there's no other clue than the scar?

274
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:34,913
Well, the culprit was wearing gloves,

275
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,915
so no fingerprints were found on the sword

276
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,917
that the Superintendent snatched from him.

277
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:42,921
That sword was the murder weapon for the serial killings

278
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,568
and seems to have been smeared with the blood of the victims too,

279
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:48,927
so it seems to have been difficult to pin down the culprit's blood.

280
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,968
No one knows what he looks like either?

281
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:54,268
Long haired, wearing a cap and beard.

282
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,935
It's so obviously a disguise.

283
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,768
Then, there's no way anything can be confirmed.

284
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,868
The whistle!

285
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,668
-Whistle? -Yep!

286
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:07,568
There's a tune that the killer was always whistling,

287
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,268
so the Superintendent told me to secretly confirm

288
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,951
which of the two is doing so.

289
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,668
What kind of tune is it?

290
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,468
I have no idea.

291
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,068
He wouldn't tell me because he said

292
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,968
he didn't want to give me preconceived ideas

293
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:24,268
that would make me ask questions that would give away the fact

294
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,968
that a police investigation is underway.

295
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:28,768
But if such a dangerous person is around,

296
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,368
why would he deliberately make Conan come back here?

297
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:35,568
I was the one that forced him to let me stay here.

298
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:38,977
Besides, if I suddenly disappear, the killer may get suspicious

299
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:42,981
and realize that officers are staking out outside.

300
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,268
And like I just said, a while ago,

301
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:50,989
it's not that we're 100% sure that one of the two is the killer.

302
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,991
True, but...

303
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:56,068
Yes.

304
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:59,968
If you'd like to take a bath, it's ready.

305
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:03,768
You mean we were served dinner, and we get to take a bath here too?

306
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:07,005
Well, then, thank you so much.

307
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,568
But there's only one bath tub.

308
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,368
So if you're going to take a bath,

309
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:13,011
I think that young lady should do so first.

310
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,568
-What? -Go take a bath!

311
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,017
You won't get to take a bath in a gorgeous house like this ever again!

312
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,468
I guess you're right.

313
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:25,023
Okay then, Conan, let's take a bath together!

314
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:29,668
It's been a long time since we washed each other's back.

315
00:17:31,268 --> 00:17:33,768
No, I didn't bring any change with me besides.

316
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:37,035
And I took a bath last night, so...

317
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,468
Really?

318
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:42,168
But...

319
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:45,368
if you insist, then!

320
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,568
-See you. -Yeah.

321
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:53,051
I decided not to take a bath

322
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,568
since it seemed like you didn't want to take a bath, Conan.

323
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,055
Okay.

324
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:59,057
Well, we've got to worry more about the killer

325
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,668
than taking a bath right now anyway.

326
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:04,168
But we don't even know what tune the killer was whistling,

327
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,568
so we have no way of checking.

328
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:09,668
The only thing we can do for now is to figure out

329
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:13,568
which of the two men is the one that the lady is looking for.

330
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:20,368
Pops was talking to Mr. Kusumoto and Mr. Banba a while ago, right?

331
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:22,568
Yes, as to the date the accident occurred

332
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,568
and the hospital that she was taken to.

333
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:28,168
Their answers were exactly the same.

334
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,968
Was it really the same?

335
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:32,168
Wasn't there anything that was different?

336
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:34,268
My, how unusual.

337
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:37,095
You were close by too, Conan, and you weren't listening?

338
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:38,268
No.

339
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:41,968
I was distracted by the officers who were staking the house out.

340
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,868
Well, if I were to pick out what was different...

341
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:48,068
Mr. Kusumoto repeated time and again that

342
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:49,768
he was skinny when he was a child.

343
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:54,468
And Mr. Banba kept emphasizing the fact that he used to be a bookworm.

344
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,668
Is that all?

345
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,268
Yes.

346
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:01,468
Would you like to go ask the lady now?

347
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,468
But...

348
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,768
I can't help feeling that the lady

349
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:10,368
already knows who the man of her memories is.

350
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:17,135
I've seen these in dramas and on movies, but...

351
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,768
I sure am surprised

352
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:21,139
to find that there is actually a gorgeous bath like this.

353
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:26,268
Hey there, Mr. Detective.

354
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,668
We're going to join you.

355
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,149
You're both taking a bath together?

356
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,868
You two get along quite well, don't you?

357
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,768
No, it's just coincidence.

358
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:37,155
Since I heard that you were taking a bath,

359
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:41,568
I decided to come and ask you how much you knew.

360
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:44,168
And? How about it?

361
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:47,168
You already know which one of us is the real one, right?

362
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:50,568
No, that's confidential.

363
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:51,968
This is great.

364
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,568
Now I don't have to go out of my way to ask them

365
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,868
about the tune that the Superintendent asked me to check on.

366
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,968
Butler.

367
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,183
Are you taking a bath, too?

368
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,768
No.

369
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,868
Kurumi asked me wash the detective's back,

370
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:12,568
that's why I'm here.

371
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:18,368
That's taking things too far.

372
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,568
If I knew which of them was the one I'm looking for,

373
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,968
I wouldn't do such a thing as to call Detective Mouri over.

374
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:26,368
I guess not.

375
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:29,207
Isn't there anything about that person

376
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,209
that you want to meet that you haven't mentioned on TV?

377
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,368
I wonder... I think I said everything there is to say.

378
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:37,868
Well, he was a very honest person

379
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:42,168
so I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will also soon find out who he is.

380
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:43,968
Very honest?

381
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:48,068
Yes. When he went out to buy a pack of sushi for lunch,

382
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,168
he received 100 yen more in change than he should've.

383
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,231
He went all the way back to the shop to return it, right?

384
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,468
Yes. He said he had to because it doesn't belong to him.

385
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,968
He liked sushi.

386
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:01,239
Yes. The other thing I remember is

387
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,241
the fried noodles we both ate at the beach house.

388
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:07,568
I was surprised at the large amount of red ginger he put on the noodles.

389
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,868
Maybe this is the first time I heard about this.

390
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,249
Is that so?

391
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,268
Then, please tell Mr. Mouri about it.

392
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:20,068
Thank you so very much.

393
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,368
No problem at all.

394
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,768
Taking a bath like this,

395
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:28,868
it make you want to hum a tune, doesn't it, you two?

396
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:31,868
-Yes. -Right.

397
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:34,468
Do you have a tune you like?

398
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:36,168
Well, yeah.

399
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:39,277
There's a tune that I hum a lot.

400
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:51,289
Superintendent, it's mail from Mr. Mouri.

401
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:52,468
And?

402
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:54,568
The man with the brown hair hums jazz

403
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,295
and the tanned man likes soul music.

404
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:59,297
That's all.

405
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,301
Send Mouri back mail.

406
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:04,568
The contents...

407
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:08,768
Keep checking?

408
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:13,311
But how do I keep checking when I've already run out of things to say?

409
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,313
Are you all right, butler?

410
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,315
You're sweating profusely.

411
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:18,768
Yes, well...

412
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,768
The air conditioner of the bathroom

413
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:23,321
has been out of order from the other day.

414
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,323
In view through his shirt that is damp with sweat on his back...

415
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,868
He has a scar?

416
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,327
Which means...

417
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:34,468
There are three men who have a scar extending in a straight line,

418
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:37,068
in this house right now.

419
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:05,140
"Sushi"

421
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,425
Go ahead and order what you want.

422
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,118
Okay! Tuna, medium fatty tuna and super fatty tuna.

423
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:10,720
Two eggs.
