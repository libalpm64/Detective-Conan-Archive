1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,140
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,740
Owning a super car is everyone's dream

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,740
and emotions run as high as the price.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:03,190
"The Super Car's Trap (Part 1)"

9
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,390
How beautiful!

10
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,890
You can see the ocean!

11
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,390
You sure can!

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,390
Hey. Where's Mr. Mouri?

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,690
That's strange, he was walking with us just a while ago.

14
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,190
Hey! Why do you guys get to rest? That's not fair.

15
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,590
Good grief, winning first prize in the drawing was real lucky

16
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,590
but why's the hotel in such an inconvenient place

17
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,790
and there's no buses either.

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,190
Dad!

19
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,490
Hurry up, Dad!

20
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,590
What an inconvenient hotel.

21
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,490
I knew it was too good to be true.

22
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,990
The "eat all you can shabu-shabu" 2nd prize would've been better, huh?

23
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,490
You can say that again.

24
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,090
Come on, don't be a spoil sport!

25
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,890
Well, I can't help it.

26
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,090
When're we going to reach the hotel anyway?

27
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,490
We're almost there, don't give up!

28
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,290
That place we can see from here,

29
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,690
I wonder if that's the Kirigamini Hotel.

30
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,090
Please fill in the registration card.

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,490
Mouri?

32
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,790
It's Mr. Mouri, right? It'll be room 201.

33
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,790
You know, this is a pretty nice hotel

34
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,290
but why don't you provide your guests with pick-up service

35
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,890
from the nearest train station or something?

36
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,590
Stop it, dad.

37
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,290
"Hisashi Suguro(28)" -I'm terribly sorry.

38
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,190
"Kirigamini Hotel Front Desk Manager" -Let me show you to your room now.

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,690
Sorry.

40
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,690
Let's go, Conan... Huh?

41
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,490
Conan? Where are you?

42
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,490
Neat, look at that...

43
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,990
This is great!

44
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,290
Conan, what are you doing here?

45
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,690
Good grief, you're always wandering off.

46
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,790
Look at that, isn't that neat?

47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,590
Look at all those old sports cars!

48
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,990
They are impressive.

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,090
"Jaguar xk120" -This is a Jaguar xk120!

50
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,690
The long nose and the beautifully curved fender

51
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,490
is its characteristic features

52
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,190
and it looks like a real jaguar, doesn't it?

53
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,790
Even today, many Jaguar collectors dream of owning this car.

54
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,090
And this...

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,890
"Mercedes Benz 300SL, Gull wing" -This is Mercedes Benz 300SL, Gull wing.

56
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,290
Gull wing means the wings of a seagull.

57
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,790
When you open the door,

58
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,790
it looks like a seagull with its wings spread out, doesn't it?

59
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,590
You're right!

60
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,790
Isn't that a Cadillac over there?

61
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,990
"Cadillac El Dorado" -Yes, a Cadillac El Dorado.

62
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,990
It's a 1953 convertible!

63
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,390
It's said to be the most powerful

64
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,690
and ultimate American model.

65
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,890
Production was limited to only about 500 cars

66
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,090
and I heard they virtually disappeared from the show rooms in no time.

67
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,890
They say collectors still talk about

68
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,190
the El Dorado legacy!

69
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,390
You know a lot of about these cars, don't you, kid?

70
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,490
This is the historic car show room we've just put up.

71
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,390
I see.

72
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,190
The owner of this hotel is quite a car enthusiast.

73
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,690
You could say he rebuilt this hotel just for this show room.

74
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,890
What's that?

75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,990
There's an open space back there.

76
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,790
Yes, that space is reserved

77
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,890
for the owner's personal Ferrari Dino.

78
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,590
What? When you say Ferrari Dino,

79
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,190
you don't mean the 206 GT, do you?

80
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,790
I certainly do.

81
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,390
Amazing!

82
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,790
Conan, what kind of car is it?

83
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,490
They only made 152 of them

84
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,990
and it's close to impossible to get your hands on one now.

85
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,590
"Ferrari Dino 260GT" -Dino is the nickname of Alfredino Ferrari,

86
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,090
the only son of Enzo Ferrari, Ferrari's creator.

87
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,790
He died when he was 24 years old

88
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,490
but the engine he helped design

89
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,590
was built into the car.

90
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,090
That's why Enzo Ferrari named the model

91
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,390
after his beloved son.

92
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,590
So that's the story behind it.

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,790
Suguro!

94
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,290
Why isn't the manager of the front desk at the front desk,

95
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,690
what are you doing here?

96
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,890
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,690
By the way, guests.

98
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,890
"Zenkichi Kuroiwa (45)" -This show room will be open

99
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,190
"Hotel Manager" -for viewing starting tomorrow,

100
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,590
until then, it is off limits to unauthorized personnel.

101
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,390
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,890
I've seen that guest somewhere before.

103
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,190
I'm glad you arrived safely, sir.

104
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,790
"Daigo Teraizumi (60)" -This car's worth more than my life

105
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,390
"Hotel President" -but driving it from Tokyo sure wore me out.

106
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,990
Sir, the cars are already in their places.

107
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,190
Why don't you take yours there now?

108
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,990
Hold it, just wait one minute, don't rush me.

109
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,290
I want to spend some time with "my friend"!

110
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,990
Once it's on display,

111
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,690
I won't be able to take it for a spin whenever I feel like it anymore.

112
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,390
Sir, look at this.

113
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,190
A detective.

114
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,590
What is this? There's only one bed in here!

115
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,390
Don't complain.

116
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,690
We should just be thankful we got first prize in the drawing.

117
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,690
Do they expect all three of us to sleep on one bed?

118
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,390
Let's tell them to give us a bigger room!

119
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,890
Never mind, we'll use this sofa.

120
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,390
He's such a baby.

121
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,390
Don't worry! I'll take care of it!

122
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,790
The opening ceremonies at 3.00 pm tomorrow afternoon.

123
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,490
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

124
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,290
That's right, don't worry.

125
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,390
We're going ahead as scheduled, understand?

126
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,290
Conan, get in here!

127
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,990
Let me go, Ran!

128
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,990
Stop being so stubborn, dad!

129
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,790
The hotel's not so busy, what's the big deal?

130
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,190
I'm going to make them give us a bigger room!

131
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,290
But won't they charge us if we do that?

132
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,690
And if you make too big a fuss, they might throw us out!

133
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,290
Mr. Mouri?

134
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,290
A threatening letter?

135
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,390
Let's see here.

136
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,490
Don't open the show room

137
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,190
or you'll be sorry.

138
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,890
That letter arrived at the hotel a few days ago,

139
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,490
my staff and I were just discussing what to do about it.

140
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,790
For a threatening letter, it doesn't sound so threatening,

141
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,390
maybe it's just someone's idea of a joke?

142
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,590
I hope you're right.

143
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,890
But just to be on the safe side,

144
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,390
would you mind guarding it until tomorrow's opening?

145
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,290
We'd like the infamous private detective Kogoro Mouri

146
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,290
to help us in this matter.

147
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,690
Did you contact the police?

148
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,190
If you accept this assignment,

149
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,790
as a special favor, the hotel will let you stay in this suite,

150
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,990
which our very best.

151
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,090
This suite? Really? Dad.

152
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,690
All right! I'll do it.

153
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,190
Thank you very much.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,390
I can rest at ease now.

155
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,990
You can all get a good night's sleep, I'll take care of everything.

156
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,490
By the way, Ran,

157
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,290
would you like to go for an after dinner drive with me?

158
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,790
You mean in the Dino?

159
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,090
Hey sir, can I go too?

160
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,190
Of course you can.

161
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,090
Can I go too, dad?

162
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,490
Geez, this is delicious, this filet is the best I've ever tasted.

163
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,590
Boy, it's good.

164
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,490
How embarrassing.

165
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,890
Boy, that was good!

166
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,690
Bring me another serving!

167
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,390
Oh no! Did it get on you?

168
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,490
Don't worry, it's not too bad.

169
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,890
Dad, you've had too much to drink!

170
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,690
Sir! It's terrible!

171
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,790
There's trouble in the show room!

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,890
What?

173
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,990
Let me go,

174
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,990
don't try to stop me!

175
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,190
-Calm down, Mr. Ootake! -Let me go!

176
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,590
Don't do it!

177
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,190
Get out of my way!

178
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,690
Let go of me!

179
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,890
Let me do as I please!

180
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,090
Don't be a fool!

181
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,190
Shut up!

182
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,290
I'm going to wreck this car!

183
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,590
Mr. Ootake, what's the matter with you?

184
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,490
You love this car more than anything!

185
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,490
What?

186
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,990
Eh? He's trying to wreck his own car?

187
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,090
Mr. Ootake, how could you?

188
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,590
How would you know how I feel?

189
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,190
What is this all about?

190
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,190
I... I'm going to destroy this darn show room!

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,980
This car, this 1953 El Dorado convertible was my dream.

192
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,980
"Ichirou Ootake (55)" -I worked night and day

193
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,280
"Travel Agency Manager" -and finally saved enough to buy it.

194
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,580
Then why are you trying to destroy something so precious?

195
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,980
I'd rather destroy it with my own hands

196
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,680
than let someone else have it.

197
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,980
That's why.

198
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,180
Let someone else have it? What do you mean?

199
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,680
Ask Teraizumi over there what I mean,

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,280
and then you'll know.

201
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,580
What is this about, Mr. Teraizumi?

202
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,680
It's all a gross misunderstanding.

203
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,280
Mr. Ootake, you should be thanking me rather than hating me.

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
Thank you?

205
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,080
Not one single person is looking forward to this show room opening up.

206
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,180
Except you, of course.

207
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,080
He's right.

208
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,280
I understand perfectly how Mr. Ootake feels

209
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,680
about wanting to destroy his own car.

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,780
It is true, no one is looking forward

211
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,280
to seeing this show room open up.

212
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Excuse me, who are you two?

213
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,980
"Shinsuke Sagara (37)" -My name is Shinsuke Sagara,

214
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,280
"Car Repair Factory Manager" -like Mr. Ootake, I was also

215
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,480
forced to let this Mercedes Benz go.

216
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
"Jouji Kameoka (40)" -I'm Joji Kameoka,

217
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,480
"Car Realtor Company Manager" -the former owner of that Jaguar.

218
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,880
That Teraizumi over there,

219
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,880
swindled the three of us and took our cars away!

220
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,080
That's just nonsense.

221
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,180
You brought that bad luck upon yourselves.

222
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,880
What do you mean, he swindled you?

223
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,580
Although it wasn't big, we all ran our own businesses.

224
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,680
I ran a travel agency.

225
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,880
I was a realtor.

226
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,380
I ran an car repair factory,

227
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,280
but with the economy so bad, we were having a difficult time.

228
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,580
And that's when that Teraizumi approached us and said that

229
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,980
if we put our cars down as collateral,

230
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,780
he'd lend us money at a low interest rate.

231
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,380
Of course, we accepted the offer.

232
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,980
But it was a trap.

233
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,680
We didn't find out until later,

234
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,980
but that fellow was working behind our backs

235
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,380
and sabotaging our businesses.

236
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,080
We couldn't meet the dead line to repay our loans

237
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,580
and so he got our cars.

238
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,780
Teraizumi intended to cheat us from the very start,

239
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,080
that's why he offered to lend us money!

240
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,480
How dare you say things like that about me?

241
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,380
Do you have proof I sabotaged your business?

242
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,380
If you've got the energy to tell idiotic stories,

243
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,680
why don't you go out

244
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,880
and do something about getting the money to pay me back?

245
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,480
Why you thief...

246
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,680
You don't scare me,

247
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,580
so you're the one who send me that threatening letter.

248
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,080
Threatening letter?

249
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,880
Don't play dumb,

251
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,680
this show room will open, no matter what you do!

252
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,680
Those shoes...

253
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,980
Don't worry! I'll take care of it!

254
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,080
The opening ceremonies at 3.00 pm tomorrow afternoon.

255
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,480
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

256
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,180
That's right, don't worry.

257
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,080
We're going ahead as scheduled, understand?

258
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,680
Excuse me. Mr. Sagara, what room are you in?

259
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
I'm in 202.

260
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,380
Why do you want to know?

261
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,180
No, that car's really something else

262
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,780
and I just thought I'd drop by and ask you all about it.

263
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,980
Well, tonight's not a good time. I have plans.

264
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,580
What kind of plans?

265
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,880
I don't think that's any of your business.

266
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
Yeah, you're right.

267
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,980
Room service?

268
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,580
I didn't ordered anything.

269
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,080
I think you've made a mistake.

270
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,680
No, you're the owner's guest

271
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,180
and this is compliments of the hotel.

272
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Please feel free to call me if there's anything else you need.

273
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,980
Well, if you say so.

274
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,880
Maybe I'll have some wine then,

275
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,580
something from the Bourgogne region.

276
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,180
No, dad, no!

277
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,280
I'm very sorry about ruining your pants earlier.

278
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,680
No problem, it was nothing.

279
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,780
I changed right away.

280
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,080
That's the Dino's engine.

281
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Now that you mention it,

282
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,780
I hear a car engine too, but it's very soft.

283
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,680
There's no doubt about it, it's the Dino!

284
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
Are you sure?

285
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
Sir, where are you going at this hour?

286
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,680
Those guys put me in a bad mood.

287
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,180
I'm going for a drive.

288
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,780
Mr. Teraizumi, the fog is thick tonight, I don't think you should go.

289
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,080
It's safer than spending the night in the same hotel with those guys!

290
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,580
Remember, drive carefully.

291
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,080
I will.

292
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,080
Sir, Mr. Teraizumi hasn't returned yet.

293
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,480
Oh, for goodness sakes, and it's already 9.00 am,

294
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,180
where could he be?

295
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,580
He's still not back?

296
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,480
He's such a hopeless case.

297
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,680
But then the opening ceremony's not until 3.00 pm,

298
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,080
there's still plenty of time.

299
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
You've got to be kidding,

300
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,680
we've got to get the Dino set up

301
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,980
and the guest will start arriving at about noon.

302
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,280
I think it's odd though, he hasn't called at all.

303
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,780
Did I hear Teraizumi's not back yet?

304
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,480
Mr. Kameoka, Mr. Ootake.

305
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,980
If he's been involved in an accident and can't get back,

306
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,080
then I guess the opening ceremony's off.

307
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
God's punished him, I know it!

308
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
Doesn't Mr. Teraizumi have a cellular phone or something?

309
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,580
Oh, that's right, I forgot all about that.

310
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,480
Let me have that, I'll give him a piece of my mind

311
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,080
and let him know how worried we were.

312
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,280
Hello, is this Mr. Teraizumi?

313
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,880
It's me, Mouri. Where are you?

314
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,080
Where am I?

315
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,680
It... it's pitch black.

316
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,280
Pitch black?

317
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,780
Hello, Mr. Teraizumi...

318
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,080
What's the matter?

319
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,180
It sounded like he was hurt.

320
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,580
He said, "Where am I? It's pitch black"

321
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,780
and then the line went dead.

322
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,080
Pitch black?

323
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
But it's all white outside with fog.

324
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,680
Mr. Mouri, what did he mean pitch black?

325
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,080
Sir, it's 10.00 am.

326
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,980
We've got to start preparing for today's ceremony.

327
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,480
Yes, you're right.

328
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,080
Suguro, I'm counting on you.

329
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,280
Yes, sir.

330
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,680
Today's ceremony is cancelled, cancelled!

331
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,180
God's punished him for sure!

332
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,680
Good grief.

333
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,380
It's just like the threatening letter said.

334
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Ran?

335
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,980
Ran! Where are you!

336
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,480
Conan! Over here!

337
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,580
Ran!

338
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,780
Ran, what happened, are you all right?

339
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,080
Yes, I'm fine.

340
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,780
Ran!

341
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,480
What happened, Ran?

342
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,180
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,880
I was taking my morning walk

344
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,380
when I heard this voice in the fog and it just scared me.

345
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,280
Aren't you Noda, the security guard?

346
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
What are you doing here?

347
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,280
"Kazuo Noda (50), Security Guard" -Well. I saw this young lady

348
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280
walking in the fog and she was heading for the cliff

349
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,580
so I thought I better warn her

350
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,780
and then all of a sudden, she starts screaming.

351
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,780
Good grief, you scared everybody!

353
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,980
It's a car.

354
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,780
Maybe Mr. Teraizumi's finally come back.

355
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,480
No, that doesn't sound like him.

356
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,380
That's Mr. Sagara's car.

357
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,080
What's going on? Why're you all out here?

358
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,080
You were right, you can tell whose car it is

359
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
just by hearing the engine, that's fantastic.

360
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,180
I know most of our regular guests.

361
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,480
Well, I've got to get back to work.

362
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,980
Mr. Sagara, where were you last night?

363
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,480
Well, I went for a little drive around here.

364
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
Did you see Mr. Teraizumi's car?

365
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,980
No. Now step back,

366
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm going to go park my car.

367
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Sir, it's already too late to get the Dino on display.

368
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,580
Oh well, since we don't know where Mr. Teraizumi is,

369
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,680
there's nothing we can do.

370
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,480
Somebody, come quick!

371
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,580
Teraizumi's...

372
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,180
Something's wrong! He's in his car!

373
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,480
What?

374
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,680
Owner!

375
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,180
Mr. Teraizumi!

376
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Owner!

377
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,280
Get a doctor, call an ambulance!

378
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,080
It's too late, he's already dead.

379
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
The cause of death is carbon monoxide poison.

380
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,480
The engine is running and the car is filled with exhaust fumes.

381
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,280
I guess the exhaust fumes flowed backwards into the car.

382
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,380
So that means this is an accidental death.

383
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,380
The window's slightly open.

384
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,080
What does this mean?

385
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,580
Why? Why is the window open?

386
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,080
Was this really an accident?

387
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,400
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,120
"Coal tar"

389
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,800
Next episode is the solution.

390
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,140
I wonder if uncle will buy a car tool.

391
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
A Ferrari or something?

392
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,820
That's not possible.
