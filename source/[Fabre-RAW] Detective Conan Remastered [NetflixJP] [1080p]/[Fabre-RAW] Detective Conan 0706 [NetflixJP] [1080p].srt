1
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:05,244
As compensation for what happened on the Bell Tree Express,

2
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:08,744
Sonoko invited us to go to Izu Highlands.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,944
And for some reason, Tohru Amuro was also there

4
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,644
as a tennis coach.

5
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,844
Conan!

6
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:20,444
By some queer work of fate,

7
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,001
we ended up taking a rest at a villa

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
where a group of tennis club members were gathered.

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,444
However, when I came to, lying next to me on the floor

10
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,844
was a corpse in an unnatural position.

11
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,244
Aiming for a 100% solution.

12
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:35,644
He cleared all mysteries and codes.

13
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,744
I deduced the locked room murder with Bourbon?

14
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:40,019
What's he after sticking around me?

15
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,444
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,544
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,744
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:29,898
"Bourbon Solves the Mystery"

19
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:36,135
Yes. I went to Ishiguri's room

20
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:38,137
to ask him if he really didn't want

21
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:40,139
cold Chinese noodles for lunch.

22
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:42,898
"Kotone Momozono (21)" -But he said he didn't want it since he wanted

23
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,598
"University Student" -to eat the ice cake from yesterday.

24
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,898
I see.

25
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,147
Then, what did you do after that?

26
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,098
After eating lunch with everyone in the kitchen,

27
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,798
I took a shower.

28
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,598
Come to think of it, my girls also said they took a shower.

29
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,198
Yes. After that, I stayed with them

30
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,898
until I went to check on Ishiguri together with Machi.

31
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:09,398
By the way, when did the spare key to Mr. Ishiguri's room disappear?

32
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,198
I think it was last night.

33
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:15,698
I had the key in the drawer in my room.

34
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:18,177
Yes, that's right.

35
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,898
"Machi Umejima (22)" -I went to check on Ishiguri

36
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:21,298
"University Student" -together with Kotone.

37
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,598
You went there just that once?

38
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,398
I also went there before I took a shower.

39
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:30,198
I wanted to tell him that I was going to use the shower

40
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,191
because I experienced him peeping me some time ago.

41
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:35,198
Did you take a shower after Ms. Kotone?

42
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:36,195
Yes.

43
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,798
And? Was Mr. Ishiguri in the room back then?

44
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:42,201
He didn't answer back then,

45
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,198
but I think he was in his room.

46
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:46,598
It seems like the air conditioner was running.

47
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:48,898
Then, what were you doing before and after the shower?

48
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,598
Like I already said.

49
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,498
I was getting lunch ready

50
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,498
and mending the girls' racket.

51
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:59,098
At any rate, I was with somebody all the time.

52
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,298
Yes, I also went there

53
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,198
to apologize to Ishiguri.

54
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:06,225
"Noboru Takanashi (22)" -I kind of had it out with him before lunch.

55
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,227
"University Student" -I wanted to tell him that I am sorry.

56
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:12,498
Do you know if that was before or after Ms. Machi took a shower?

57
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:16,235
I don't know when Machi took a shower,

58
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,237
but it was after cleaning the dishes

59
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:19,598
and before taking out the garbage.

60
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,798
Come to think of it, that fight had something to do

61
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,998
with a member of the circle who passed away, right?

62
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,245
Right.

63
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,498
This winter, a man called Uryu passed away.

64
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:30,898
He was a member of our circle,

65
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,251
and he was found buried in the snow behind the lodge

66
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:34,253
after he went skiing.

67
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:38,257
Back then, the snow behind the lodge lay as high as 2 meters.

68
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:41,498
He took Ishiguri's joke saying that

69
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,698
jumping from the second floor into it wouldn't kill him literally.

70
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:45,898
He actually jumped into it.

71
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,998
Yesterday was Uryu's birthday,

72
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,998
so we all got together to celebrate it.

73
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:55,798
He had a terrible birthday last year.

74
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,277
A terrible birthday?

75
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:02,298
We got together last year at about the same time,

76
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:04,283
and since it was Uryu's birthday,

77
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,998
Ishiguri said that we should surprise him.

78
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:12,098
We snuck into the room Uryu was sleeping in through the veranda

79
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:15,598
and popped some party crackers near his ear.

80
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,998
Then he got panic and started crying.

81
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:22,598
On top of that, a video of his plight was taken

82
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,698
and it was uploaded on the web by Ishiguri.

83
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,098
I see.

84
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,898
As to you three,

85
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:31,998
it seems that you all have more than enough motive to kill Mr. Ishiguri.

86
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,498
Motive?

87
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:36,898
The only time I went to Ishiguri's room was just that once.

88
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:40,319
Other than that, I was with all of you the whole time, wasn't I?

89
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,098
I was with you while the detective was talking.

90
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:45,498
"The air conditioner in this room isn't working well,

91
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,327
so go to Ishiguri's room and rest."

92
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,698
Wasn't it me who told that to the kid?

93
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,898
-Is that true? -Yes.

94
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:55,598
After that, I saw Mr. Ishiguri in the corridor,

95
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:57,398
so I had him take me with him.

96
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,298
How could I possibly commit murder

97
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:01,298
knowing that a child is sleeping in the room?

98
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,798
True.

99
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,498
No matter what kind of trick was used,

100
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,798
I thought it was only possible for a man

101
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:11,298
to move the heavy corpse of Mr. Ishiguri,

102
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:14,353
which was none other than the only male suspect, Mr. Takanashi.

103
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,355
-Yes. -But...

104
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,898
if it was only to lift the top part of the body,

105
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:20,098
wouldn't a woman be able to do it too?

106
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,361
One could place the corpse up against the doorway

107
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,363
and let go of the body so it would slide down,

108
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,365
then finally close the door.

109
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,998
No. I think that would be impossible

110
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,998
because the buttocks of the corpse

111
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:32,698
was in a position that blocked the door.

112
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,498
Besides, the spare key to Mr. Ishiguri's room

113
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,598
hasn't been found yet either.

114
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,698
What's the key like?

115
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,998
It seems to have been the same kind

116
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,383
as the one found in the pocket of the corpse.

117
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,398
We haven't heard that it's been found yet.

118
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:49,998
Then, maybe it was disposed together with the trash?

119
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:53,898
I helped throw the trash away together with Ran.

120
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,098
What?

121
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:58,998
We put it into the trunk of Mr. Takanashi's car, though.

122
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:01,898
We were told that he would take it home and throw it away.

123
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:05,898
Then, maybe the key is in that trash.

124
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,298
Check it immediately!

125
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:09,098
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

126
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:13,198
Did anyone else ask you to do anything else?

127
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,998
Ms. Kotone asked us to put the sports drink

128
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,417
back into the freezer.

129
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,598
So we did that.

130
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,998
Put the sports drink into the freezer?

131
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,698
She said that she likes to drink it frozen.

132
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:27,398
At the time, there was a fuss

133
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:28,427
about Mr. Ishiguri not coming out of his room.

134
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,198
Ms. Kotone was holding a PET bottle.

135
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:35,398
I think she wanted to freeze it again because it was starting to melt.

136
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,898
She just made it look like that and put the key in there.

137
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:40,698
A key wouldn't fit inside.

138
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:46,445
After I took a shower, I took a sip of that drink,

139
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,447
but it was totally frozen.

140
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,449
Oh, that's right.

141
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,798
Ms. Machi told us that she would re-wrap

142
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,298
the grip tapes of our rackets.

143
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,298
We left our rackets with her.

144
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:58,998
And while she was at it, she also changed

145
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:01,998
the strings of our rackets, too.

146
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:04,998
Inspector Yokomizo.

147
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:08,467
We found no key in the trash.

148
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,498
I see.

149
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:12,498
The sports drink in the freezer is frozen solid

150
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:17,098
and it doesn't seem possible for a key to be inside it.

151
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:19,198
What about the rackets?

152
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,098
We checked the rackets of everyone,

153
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:24,498
but there wasn't anything that looks like a key attached anywhere.

154
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:26,198
Speaking of rackets, we got a report

155
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,898
that the strings of the racket under the corpse's buttocks

156
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,398
seem to be out of shape in several spots.

157
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:34,098
The strings? Why?

158
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,198
We don't know.

159
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:39,098
Also, the shape of the copper vase that had blood on it,

160
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:42,298
matched the wound on the head of the corpse.

161
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,698
But for some reason, it seems there was water in the vase.

162
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,098
Water?

163
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,398
Why would water be inside the murder weapon?

164
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,898
By the way, the estimated time of death

165
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,098
was two to three hours before the corpse was found.

166
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:57,898
Depending on the temperature of the room at that time,

167
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:01,498
there may be a discrepancy of about 30 minutes or so.

168
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:04,523
I had lunch with everyone here

169
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:07,698
around three hours before the corpse was found.

170
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:12,531
All three of them had the chance to commit the crime.

171
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,798
You. Didn't you see the culprit?

172
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:17,898
You were in the room the whole time, weren't you?

173
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,998
I was fast asleep.

174
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:23,798
So you also don't remember that Sonoko and I

175
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,898
took the cold Chinese noodles to that room, do you?

176
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,198
Nope. I think I was asleep.

177
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,549
Come to think of it, Ran.

178
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:34,098
Back then, you said something weird, didn't you?

179
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:36,555
It seems he's asleep, so why not let him be?

180
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,298
Missing lunch won't kill him either.

181
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,559
That's true.

182
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,298
It seems that the air conditioner of this room is working, too.

183
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,565
How would you know that

184
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,567
despite being outside of the room?

185
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:52,098
That's because my toes were cold.

186
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:54,298
I'm sure that cold air was leaking out

187
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:56,598
through the space under the door.

188
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,898
If I remember correctly, Ms. Machi said something similar.

189
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,798
I think he was in the room.

190
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:03,998
It seems like the air conditioner was running.

191
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:09,098
I see. That's how it is.

192
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:12,591
The culprit ingeniously used an object that doesn't keep its form

193
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:16,595
and completed the locked room murder.

194
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:22,601
Officer.

195
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,603
Maybe it was an accident after all?

196
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:29,555
Ishiguri's corpse was on the floor and was blocking the door.

197
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:32,611
If there was a racket under his buttocks,

198
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,655
maybe when he tried to pick up the racket,

199
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:39,555
the vase just happened to fall on him?

200
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,621
On top of that, the room was locked.

201
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,455
The spare key hasn't been found yet, has it?

202
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,955
No.

203
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:50,255
The area around the villa is being checked now.

204
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,655
However, we've still got no such report.

205
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,255
I don't care what it is,

206
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,055
but this is what I call messy handwriting.

207
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,155
As long as I can read it, it's fine.

208
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,555
Okay, he sat down.

209
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:03,455
Like usual, I'll fire the tranquilizer gun at Pops.

210
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,555
What are you doing, Conan?

211
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:10,955
The lid of my wristwatch broke.

212
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,255
Even if I wanted to, I guess I can't start

213
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,655
the Sleeping Kogoro stunt in front of him.

214
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:20,659
He's Bourbon, a member of the Black Organization.

215
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,661
I can't afford to have him find out that I'm Shinichi Kudo,

216
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
whose body has become a child's because of the organization's drug.

217
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,555
Even if Vermouth says nothing about it,

218
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:30,669
they may still find out that the same thing's happened to Ai, too.

219
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,155
Besides,

220
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,755
maybe the sound that we heard when we were downstairs

221
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,677
wasn't the sound of the vase falling, was it?

222
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,455
Back then, only the corpse

223
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:43,155
and the sleeping boy were in that room.

224
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:46,055
Besides, the vase wouldn't fall on its own.

225
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:50,055
I guess it was the sound of the house creaking after all.

226
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:51,455
If it was the creaking of the house,

227
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:54,155
I also heard it when we were eating cold Chinese noodles.

228
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,755
It was totally different.

229
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:57,355
Hey, hey.

230
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,855
Speaking of cold Chinese noodles,

231
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:01,555
you use ice when making it, right?

232
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,703
Yes. The noodles that are boiled

233
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,705
are cooled down in ice water.

234
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,955
Hey, cut out the unnecessary talk.

235
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:15,155
But ice melts, doesn't it?

236
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:17,055
That's common sense!

237
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:20,355
If so, if the vase was made of ice,

238
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,455
it would eventually melt and fall on its own.

239
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:24,723
You idiot.

240
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,725
That vase is made of bronze.

241
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,355
I mean, you touched it too, didn't you?

242
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:31,855
Please wait.

243
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:35,255
If a lot of ice is stacked

244
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,355
only on one side in the vase,

245
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:40,739
and it was placed near the rim of the shelf,

246
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,741
it's just a matter of time before the ice would melt,

247
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:46,255
and the vase would tilt out of balance and fall on its own, right?

248
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:49,955
But if a large amount of ice were to be carried around,

249
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,955
wouldn't anyone have noticed it?

250
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:56,155
No, you can do so without holding it in your hands.

251
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,155
When the Chinese noodles were being made,

252
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:01,355
all three of them were in their tennis wear.

253
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:05,355
The pants of men's tennis wear have large pockets

254
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:08,255
so that tennis balls would fit into them.

255
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,555
There are also skirts in women's tennis wear

256
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:13,555
with pockets big enough for the balls to fit in.

257
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,555
But...

258
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,777
even if it were possible to automatically drop the vase,

259
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,455
it wouldn't be possible to move the corpse

260
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,155
over to the door, would it?

261
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:25,155
There were no drag trails on the floor either.

262
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,355
Come to think of it,

263
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,355
ice is very slippery, isn't it?

264
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:31,055
Not you again, brat.

265
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:34,155
I see! I've figured it out!

266
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:37,655
Remember the racket under the buttocks of the corpse?

267
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,155
The corpse was moved by placing ice under the racket

268
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,801
that was under the buttocks of the corpse.

269
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,755
The strings of the racket being out of shape proves just that!

270
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,755
Wow, Sonoko!

271
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:50,455
But if that was the case,

272
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,811
like the vase, water from the melted ice

273
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,813
should be left on the floor.

274
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:57,855
And the slacks of the corpse should also be wet.

275
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:01,455
But there were no such traces.

276
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,821
Is that so?

277
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,355
It would've been nice if there was something

278
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:08,155
like ice that leaves nothing behind even after it melts.

279
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:11,955
Could that be dry ice, then?

280
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,833
Dry ice is made of carbon dioxide,

281
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,655
so it will vanish.

282
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:22,055
But dry ice can't be carried around easily.

283
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:24,455
Unlike ice, you can't touch it directly.

284
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:28,155
Mr. Ishiguri unknowingly carried it with him.

285
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:31,455
After deciding to have lunch, he was about to go to his room.

286
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:36,055
Someone must've secretly put dry ice inside the ice cake box.

287
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,755
The culprit probably took a racket with a string

288
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,855
after hitting Mr. Ishiguri on the head with the vase and killing him.

289
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:42,855
The racket that had a string pulled through it beforehand

290
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:47,155
was placed on top of several pieces of dry ice.

291
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:50,555
Then, the buttocks of the corpse were placed on the racket.

292
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,355
After the culprit left the room,

293
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:55,755
the string was pulled towards the door.

294
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:57,955
Of course, the string was left untied

295
00:14:57,955 --> 00:14:59,655
so that it could be retrieved later.

296
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:00,879
I see.

297
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:05,855
That's why when I went to that room, my toes felt chilly.

298
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:08,887
It was because the dry ice was near the door.

299
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,891
Come to think of it, Ms. Machi said something similar, too.

300
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,055
Yes.

301
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:16,895
Didn't any of you notice anything?

302
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,255
-No. -Neither did I.

303
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:23,255
I figured that the boy was sleeping in the room,

304
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,903
so I left right away.

305
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,905
I see.

306
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,055
I've finally figured out the culprit.

307
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,913
First of all, we could remove Ms. Machi from the list of suspects

308
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,917
because she testified that there was dry ice.

309
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:42,455
And the same goes for Mr. Takanashi

310
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,555
who knew that the boy was in Mr. Ishiguri's room.

311
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:47,755
Since there probably isn't anyone who would commit a murder

312
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,755
right next to a sleeping child.

313
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,055
If so, rather than the two, the culprit is the one

314
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,455
who went to Mr. Ishiguri's room before them.

315
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:58,255
The one who could buy enough time for the ice and dry ice to melt.

316
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:01,555
Ms. Kotone Momozono.

317
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:05,455
The culprit is none other than you!

318
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:08,155
Am I wrong?

319
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,949
Hey... Hold it there, Mr. Mouri.

320
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,855
Is it alright for you not to do your usual stunt?

321
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,955
-What? -The sleeping pose!

322
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:20,555
For once, he's doing it right and then.

323
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:24,963
So, the procedure Ms. Kotone took to commit the crime is as follows.

324
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:28,055
First, while she was making the cold Chinese noodles,

325
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,955
she snuck the ice into her skirt pocket.

326
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:34,973
She said, "I'll go and ask if Ishiguri wants lunch".

327
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:37,855
With that, she left for his room.

328
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:41,855
Then, after hitting Mr. Ishiguri to death near the door,

329
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:43,755
she packed the murder weapon vase with ice

330
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,255
and put it on the shelf.

331
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,855
So, like the trick mentioned earlier, after she left the room,

332
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:52,355
she moved Mr. Ishiguri's corpse so that it would block the door.

333
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:53,755
At that time, she had no idea

334
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,995
that the boy with glasses was sleeping there.

335
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,855
After returning to the kitchen, Ms. Kotone said,

336
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:04,355
"He's not eating cold Chinese noodles after all".

337
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,455
Just like that, she lied, ate lunch as if nothing had happened,

338
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:09,555
and completed the locked room murder.

339
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:13,755
But it seems you couldn't deceive the eyes of this famed detective.

340
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:18,455
Somehow, he looks more quack when he's awake.

341
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,855
I guess so.

342
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:23,021
Then, where's the spare key?

343
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,255
The door of Ishiguri's room was locked, wasn't it?

344
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,355
Well, most probably...

345
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,655
I'm sure we'll find it somewhere in time.

346
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:34,255
That's right. Speaking of ice...

347
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,655
-Ice... -Ice?

348
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,355
When water freezes, it become icy, right?

349
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:40,755
That's why it's called ice, right?

350
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:45,055
How should I know?

351
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,755
Talking about frozen water,

352
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,555
the sports drink that Ms. Kotone was drinking...

353
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:51,855
Was the key in there, after all?

354
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,055
No way.

355
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,855
I drank that drink too,

356
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:59,855
but it was virtually frozen and the contents wouldn't come out.

357
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:03,061
Then, maybe the key was put inside before it was frozen.

358
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,355
If so, I think it should show

359
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:07,065
through the bottom of the PET bottle.

360
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,067
That's because keys are heavy.

361
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:13,071
However, if there is magic water that freezes

362
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,655
the minute the key is put inside, maybe it's possible.

363
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:19,355
Idiot. There's no such cartoon-like water.

364
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,079
There is.

365
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,655
Super-cooled water.

366
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:24,855
Water is supposed to freeze when it reaches freezing point.

367
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,085
However, this water remains unfrozen

368
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,555
even after reaching below 0 degree Celcius.

369
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,555
When stimulated by the impact of vibration or such,

370
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:34,255
it will suddenly begin to freeze.

371
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,755
The method to make it is to wrap a towel

372
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,097
around the PET bottle so that it chills evenly.

373
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,099
Leave it in a freezer at around -5 degrees Celcius

374
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,101
for four to five hours.

375
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,755
When impact is applied,

376
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,755
it will start freezing from the top

377
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:49,555
and all along the face of the PET bottle.

378
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:52,255
Ms. Kotone probably put the key

379
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:55,113
into the super-cooled sports drink in the PET bottle,

380
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,555
applied impact to it,

381
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:59,117
then turned it upside down when the top part started to freeze.

382
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,119
Therefore, the key could flow to the middle

383
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:03,121
before the entire content was frozen.

384
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,455
Then, she let Ms. Sonoko drink it.

385
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,655
Since sports drink is thickly colored

386
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,155
and looks gel-like when frozen,

387
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,755
the key inside wasn't visible.

388
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:18,155
Then, if that sports drink is melted...

389
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,855
Yes, I'm sure it'll come out.

390
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:25,143
The evidence that proves Ms. Kotone had killed Mr. Ishiguri.

391
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:29,147
Say that after it comes out, will you?

392
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,149
If it doesn't come out, you guys...

393
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,655
It's no use.

394
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,855
Because it'll come out.

395
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:39,955
The spare key with my fingerprints all over it.

396
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:42,455
Moreover, I panicked and dropped that key

397
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,555
on top of Ishiguri's blood, too.

398
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:48,155
No... No way. I drank the drink

399
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,755
that had that stuff in it?

400
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,055
But why did you kill Ishiguri?

401
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:54,855
Of course, it was to avenge Uryu's death.

402
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:57,175
I liked him.

403
00:19:57,355 --> 00:20:02,355
Are you talking about the time when Uryu took Ishiguri's joke literally?

404
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,655
It's true that Ishiguri told him that with all the snow,

405
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:07,185
even if he jumped from the second floor, he wouldn't die.

406
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,955
It was a careless statement that Ishiguri had made.

407
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:14,555
The night when Uryu's body was carried off,

408
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:17,755
I couldn't sleep, so I went out to the veranda

409
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:21,199
and saw Ishiguri digging up the snow.

410
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,755
At first, I thought that he couldn't believe

411
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,203
that Mr. Uryu had died

412
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:30,255
and was somehow trying to look for him.

413
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,155
But what he was looking for

414
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,755
was the scarf that he had wrapped around his neck.

415
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,855
The smile on his face when he saw it

416
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:40,455
told the entire story.

417
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:44,455
Uryu didn't dive into the snow intentionally,

418
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:47,225
but was rather pushed off.

419
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,855
Don't tell me that Ishiguri...

420
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:50,255
Yes.

421
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:53,855
Uryu reflexively grabbed it when he was pushed off.

422
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:56,455
Ishiguri's scarf.

423
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,555
He was probably going to help him up

424
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:03,655
after Uryu struggled and got completely exhausted.

425
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:05,243
However, the new snow that lay 2-meters high

426
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:08,755
deprived Uryu's energy as if he was in a quicksand.

427
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:12,755
When we found him, he was already...

428
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,755
But I goofed.

429
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:18,955
In order to make sure that Ishiguri would eat ice cake for lunch,

430
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:22,355
I deliberately schemed to slightly hurt a random person

431
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,555
so that I could invite him over to the villa,

432
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:27,055
in hope that the number of people eating lunch would increase.

433
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:30,055
I never imagined the racket would hit a child on the head.

434
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,155
Moreover, that child happened to be accompanied

435
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:36,055
by the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

436
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:39,277
I may have also been trapped in a quicksand

437
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:42,555
that sinks deeper the more I struggle

438
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,955
towards my own demise.

439
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:09,155
Yes, the case was solved.

440
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,155
It's all thanks to the famed Detective Mouri.

441
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,755
Is that so?

442
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:14,655
By the way, how long to you plan to stick around

443
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:16,455
with that detective?

444
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:19,377
You said the detective seems to have some connection with Sherry,

445
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:22,355
and have wanted to stick around him.

446
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:24,855
So I tried backing you up in many ways.

447
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:27,385
I don't think he's of any use to you anymore, is he?

448
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:30,055
Fortunately, information on Sherry came in,

449
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,955
and you were able to lay her to rest, too.

450
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:39,155
No. I'm even more interested now

451
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:43,401
in the detective called the Sleeping Kogoro.

452
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,860
Next Conan's Hint:

453
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,640
"Radio Program"

454
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,408
Pops who's asleep is...

455
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:54,600
Look at him.
