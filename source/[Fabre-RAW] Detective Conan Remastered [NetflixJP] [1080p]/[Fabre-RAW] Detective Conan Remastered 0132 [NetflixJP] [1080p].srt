1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,980
 Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,980
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,680
This is a 3 part episode that we haven't seen in a long time.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,580
A magic-like crime has occurred.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,080
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,490
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 1)"

9
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,490
Okay everyone, may I have your attention?

10
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,190
Here is a sheet of white handkerchief.

11
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,590
And, here is a red string and gold ring!

12
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,890
Yes, yes.

13
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,990
Please make a knot in the middle of the string, Miss.

14
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,590
Like this?

15
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,890
Then, the string with the knot is placed on the palm of your hand,

16
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,290
and the ring is placed beside it.

17
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,890
The handkerchief is placed on it.

18
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,790
I slide my devil lured finger inside the handkerchief,

19
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,990
and chant a mysterious chant.

20
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,290
Oh my, how strange. The string has gone through the ring!

21
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,190
Wow! Fantastic!

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,290
How'd you do that, Sonoko?

23
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,490
It's a secret, secret!

24
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,990
I'm going to be doing this in front of everybody tonight!

25
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,590
I see! The people that are getting together tonight

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,590
are all magic lovers, right?

27
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,590
Right, I got to know all of them on the internet!

28
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,890
It's a so-called off the net gathering!

29
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,590
The daughter of the rich Suzuki family

30
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,290
corresponding over the internet,

31
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,990
My, the internet is indispensable in this information packed world!

32
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,390
Why don't you install a computer in your office too?

33
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,590
What a surprise,

34
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,290
though that you suddenly started the internet

35
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,490
and magic as well, Sonoko.

36
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,490
Well, I met a great guy.

37
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,590
A great guy?

38
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,390
He's Mr. Katsuki Doito, age 21!

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,290
He is a regular member of the Magic Lovers' Group

40
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,890
that I am participating in!

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,990
He has a polite manner of speech and his jokes are full of wit.

42
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,690
He sometimes puts on airs...

43
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,990
But I'm sure he's a great guy.

44
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,090
Which means you never met him?

45
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,690
I'm meeting him for the first time today!

46
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,390
I'm going to show him this magic today, and surprise him!

47
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,690
I don't think he will be surprised.

48
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,190
That's just beginners' magic that is usually shown on TV.

49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,590
All you did

50
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,890
was push the knot of the string through the ring,

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,990
then pushed your thumb through and pulled it out, right?

52
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,990
Oh, I see!

53
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,090
What a smart aleck, like always.

54
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,590
Don't let him bother you.

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,790
He's been in a bad mood ever since I decided to

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,790
participate in the off the net gathering.

57
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,690
Is it really okay for me to go, though?

58
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,690
No problem! I already told them that I would be

59
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,690
bringing my girlfriend along with me.

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,190
Girlfriend?

61
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,990
What?

62
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,590
You were on the net under the pretense of being a male?

63
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,790
Right! A 30 years old man!

64
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,490
It sure was a lot of fun!

65
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,990
But, isn't the name Sonoko Suzuki going to give you away?

66
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,290
No problem!

67
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,490
Because we're all communicating using aliases called handle names.

68
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,790
Like, I'm called "The Witch's Apprentice"

69
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,990
and he's called the "Red Herring."

70
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,690
It's an old vocabulary used in ancient magic.

71
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,490
Then, why do you know his real name?

72
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,690
I asked him directly by e-mail.

73
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,890
Oh, so you used your usual love attack.

74
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,490
Exactly.

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,090
How about it?

76
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,890
People who are conversing on the internet

77
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,390
that have never seen each other are going to meet each other,

78
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,590
all of a sudden.

79
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,490
Isn't it so exciting?

80
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,690
It sure is!

81
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,390
It's just like going to a masked party.

82
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,590
Doesn't something smell funny?

83
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,790
Hello. I am here to attend the off the net gathering.

84
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,790
Welcome.

85
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,090
Oh, you're the "Witch's Apprentice," aren't you?

86
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,090
Yes.

87
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,090
We've been waiting for you!

88
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,490
How did you know?

89
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,590
That I was the "Witch's Apprentice?"

90
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,990
It's obvious from your remarks that

91
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,990
a girl is trying desperately to act like a middle-age man.

92
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,190
Right, everyone?

93
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,190
I was always having my thrills on the other side of the monitor!

94
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,290
Right!

95
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,390
Oh, my God.

96
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,490
If you are going to do something like that,

97
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,290
you've got to do it good like Ms. Tanaka.

98
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,690
Oh?

99
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,390
I wasn't trying to fake being a man like you say.

100
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,790
On the contrary, I thought that the "Disappearing Bunny"

101
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,190
was a woman.

102
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,190
Oh, is that right? I'm glad I did a good job.

103
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,490
What do you mean you did a good job?

104
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,190
I thought he was a woman

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,890
so I even talked about underwear with him.

106
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,590
Yeah, I was flustered when you did.

107
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,690
Oh, let me introduce myself,

108
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,790
I am Yoshinori Ara, the owner of this lodge.

109
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,190
And, behind me is, the part-timer that I hired, Mr. Sugama.

110
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,590
Hello.

111
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,290
Hi.

112
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,490
Katsuki...

113
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,390
Mr. Red Herring hasn't arrived yet?

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,590
Oh, he's upstairs.

115
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,590
Oh, there he comes, down the stairs.

116
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,590
Huh?

117
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,290
Huh?

118
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,990
Are you "The Witch's Apprentice"?

119
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,790
I am Katsuki Doito!

120
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,390
Oh, no.

121
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,890
My image of him is collapsing.

122
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,690
So, you were a girl after all!

123
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,490
I am overwhelmed.

124
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,290
By the way, who are you?

125
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,090
I am Ran Mouri, who was invited to come here with her.

126
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,490
I am Ran's father who came to drop them off.

127
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,690
Oh, how rude of me.

128
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,290
Please come in.

129
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,590
Oh, let me hold your bags for you.

130
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,190
I'm sure you intend to be nice,

131
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,890
but let me warn you not to get funny with the girls.

132
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,790
-Dad! -Please, I assure you...

133
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,290
Hey!

134
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,190
We're going home!

135
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,590
I am staying over too.

136
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,490
You idiot! You've got a cold!

137
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,590
Take care of the girls, okay?

138
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,990
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,490
So the one s who aren't here yet

140
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,590
are Board leader "Escape King" and "Shadow".

141
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,090
Huh? Is "Shadow" also coming?

142
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,490
What's the matter, Sonoko?

143
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,290
Well, "Shadow"

144
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,290
always writes weird things like, "I can fly,"

145
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,890
or "I can disappear at will".

146
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,890
Huh?

147
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,690
Well, we can't get started unless the board leader arrives.

148
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,990
Does anybody know Escape King's phone number?

149
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,890
I know it, as well as his real name.

150
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,490
This is the Nishiyama residence!

151
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,290
I can't come to the phone right now.

152
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,390
Huh? It's the answer phone.

153
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,790
Please leave a message after the tone.

154
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,290
"He is but the first one... Shadow"

155
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,590
We've got no choice, let's live it up until he gets here.

156
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,390
I'll get dinner ready together with Mr. Sugama,

157
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,090
then, so why don't you all go to your rooms and change the sheets?

158
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,990
Okay.

159
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,990
Wow! What a large back yard!

160
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,390
How nice.

161
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,090
I'm glad we came.

162
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,690
If Mr. Doito was how I imagined him to be,

163
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,090
it would be just perfect.

164
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,590
Hey, come on, that's not nice.

165
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,890
Dinner is ready.

166
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,990
Oh, thank you.

167
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,790
He scared me.

168
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,390
Gosh, there're no guys worth anything here.

169
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,890
The one adore is only him, after all.

170
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,190
You still have another man that you adore?

171
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,290
Yes, my prince that I haven't met yet.

172
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,090
What're you going to do about my dinner?

173
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,890
I'll make you porridge or something.

174
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,590
Sleep till we get home.

175
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,190
Mr. Tsutomu Nishiyama, 41, a resident of Haido-cho

176
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,290
was found dead in his apartment.

177
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,290
His mother who came to clean the apartment

178
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,290
reported his death to the police.

179
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,490
A mysterious phrase, "He is but the first one... Shadow."

180
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,590
was found displayed on the monitor

181
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,890
of his personal computer that was nearby.

182
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,890
The police

183
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,390
are investigating on the connection of this phrase to his death.

184
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,390
Mr. Nishiyama seems to have been into the internet,

185
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,990
and he was just about to leave for a gathering

186
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,790
with the Magic Lovers' Group

187
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,490
before the occurrence of this misfortune.

188
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,490
The next news is...

189
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,990
Hey, don't tell me this is the gathering that Ran is at now.

190
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,590
Pops, turn the car back.

191
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,690
Hurry!

192
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,390
Huh? A Japanese magician that I respect?

193
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,790
I liked Mr. Toichi Kurobane.

194
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,090
His stages were full of hope and dream.

195
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,490
Yeah! I like Mr. Kurobane too!

196
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,790
I like Yoshiro Kinoshita.

197
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,690
A genius who stole all the championship titles

198
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,190
at the young age of 20.

199
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,290
I like his teacher, Mr. Motoyasu Tsukumo.

200
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,390
What's with all of you? They're all dead already.

201
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,390
I like Mr. Kazumi Sanada who is super popular now!

202
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,790
How about you two?

203
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,290
Of course, who else but

204
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,390
The Thief Kid!

205
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,890
Huh?

206
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,090
But, he is a thief.

207
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,090
No matter what anybody says, it's the Thief Kid for me!

208
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,790
Don't tell me that the prince you adore is...

209
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,290
Yes, does it bother you?

210
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,090
Quick, Pops, hurry!

211
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,190
Shut up! I can't go any faster!

212
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,290
What is that?

213
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,990
Fire?

214
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,090
The suspended bridge is burning!

215
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,190
The only way to get to the lodge is by using this suspended bridge!

216
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,990
Pops, call the police.

217
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,290
Hey!

218
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,390
Ran,

219
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,490
I'll be right there!

220
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,890
Ran!

221
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,790
Huh?

222
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,390
Strange...

223
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,390
The phone is dead.

224
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,690
What's the matter, Ran?

225
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,290
I just felt like somebody called me.

226
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,790
Somebody calling you in the mountains like this?

227
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,890
I'll go check the entrance.

228
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,790
Don't! I'm sure there's nobody around!

229
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,790
-Conan? -Huh? Why?

230
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,190
Why is he lying on the ground here?

231
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,990
He's got a high fever.

232
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,390
Ran...

233
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,990
get out of here.

234
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,690
Hurry, and get out of here.

235
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,190
Conan!

236
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,090
Get a hold of yourself, Conan!

237
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,390
Conan! Conan!

238
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
What?

239
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,080
That kid was lying on the ground by the entrance?

240
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,280
But, why?

241
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,780
He probably wanted to spend the night here.

242
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,680
I don't think that's it.

243
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,280
Huh?

244
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,980
Conan was saying...

245
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,380
"Get out of here."

246
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,080
"Hurry and get of here."

247
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,380
What?

248
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Just... just what does that mean?

249
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,180
I don't know. He fainted right after saying so.

250
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,680
I brought some aspirin.

251
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,980
He seems be suffering from a common cold,

252
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,080
so I'm sure he'll be fine if he drinks this and rests.

253
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
Thank you.

254
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,680
-Not at all. -How can you tell?

255
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,180
I may not look it,

256
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,980
but I am a student of medical university.

257
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,580
Well, let's try and contact the board leader once more.

258
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,280
What?

259
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,980
What do you mean you can't do anything till morning, Inspector?

260
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,580
Don't yell like that, Mr. Mouri.

261
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,480
It is extremely dangerous to go to the mountains

262
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,180
by another route at night.

263
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,580
Even flying a helicopter

264
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,480
would risk crashing into trees and telephone poles

265
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,680
if we fly low during night time like this.

266
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,380
Then could you at least try calling them?

267
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,080
I've been trying to call them for some time now,

268
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,680
but the phone doesn't seem to be working.

269
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,780
It will be right over, so you stay put!

270
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,980
Darn!

271
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,880
Huh? The phone's dead.

272
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,380
Maybe the telephone line is severed somewhere?

273
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,780
We sure are in a fix.

274
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,180
He was in charge of planning everything

275
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,980
that was to take place tonight, so...

276
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,380
Shall we decide on a temporary leader, then?

277
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,580
I guess so.

278
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,480
Huh? I don't want to be leader, now.

279
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,680
Why don't we be fair and decide by stone, paper, scissors?

280
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,080
Hey, wait,

281
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,380
just deciding is no fun.

282
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,180
Why don't we decide like magic lovers would?

283
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,080
By magic?

284
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,480
Please help me then.

285
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,280
Huh? Me?

286
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Yes.

287
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,580
First, I will hide beautiful Sonoko's eyes with this handkerchief.

288
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,580
Does anyone have a paper and pencil?

289
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,480
Oh, how about this, Mr. Magician?

290
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Okay!

291
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Please take one sheet each and write your names on it.

292
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,580
Yes, yes.

293
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
After all the names are written, please collect them,

294
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,580
turn them over and give them to Sonoko.

295
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,780
Uh, so that's all the members who are here.

296
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,680
Here you go, Sonoko.

297
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,380
Oh, give her the pen too.

298
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,280
Okay, there.

299
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,380
Please back down everyone.

300
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,580
Sonoko.

301
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,080
Without showing anyone,

302
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,780
please mark the sheets with a circle, a cross or a triangle!

303
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,580
A circle, a cross and a triangle?

304
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
The one with the circle becomes the temporary leader.

305
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,480
The one who gets the cross

306
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
is in charge of livening up tonight's gathering.

307
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,180
And the one who gets the triangle

308
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,980
can make the bath or something.

309
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,580
I'll go make the bath.

310
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,080
It's okay.

311
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,980
It's a game,

312
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,980
so it's more fun if we have punishments.

313
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,480
I've finished marking the sheets!

314
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,280
Please put someone's sheet on the table, then.

315
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,080
Make sure the name is facing down.

316
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,880
Okay, so let's see who's to be the leader.

317
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,180
Wait!

318
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,980
I'll prophesy whose name is written on that sheet

319
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,780
before you flip it over!

320
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,880
Prophesy?

321
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,880
If my sixth sense is correct...

322
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,080
The temporary leader is you, Naoko Kuroda!

323
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Huh?

324
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,380
It can't be.

325
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,780
"Kuroda" -No way.

326
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,380
He's right.

327
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,280
Next, for the one who's going to make the bath,

328
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,680
Kikue Tanaka, it's you!

329
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,980
Huh? Me?

330
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,980
Wow! Bull's eye!

331
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,380
See!

332
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,180
Right.

333
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
You better not be hiding the real sheets somewhere else.

334
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,180
No way. You saw for yourself,

335
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,080
I never touched the sheets of paper

336
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,480
and the one who marked the paper

337
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,080
was Sonoko who was blindfolded.

338
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,080
All right,

339
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,580
be it making the bath or anything else, I'll do it.

340
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,780
Sorry.

341
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,080
Do you know where the firewood is?

342
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,380
It will be just fine! I was taken on a tour of this place

343
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,780
as soon as I got here.

344
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,780
Now, all that's left is the cross mark.

345
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,280
The honored person in charge of tonight's gathering is...

346
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,680
you, Mr. Doito!

347
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,080
What? Give me a break.

348
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,380
Let's see.

349
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,380
What?

350
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,680
The name of the person in charge is...

351
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,880
Your name is written, Mr. Hamano.

352
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
Huh?

353
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
See, there's no mistake about it.

354
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh, that's strange.

355
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,380
Okay, so go into your room and think something interesting up!

356
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,180
Don't make a mistake the next time around.

357
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,980
Well, well...

358
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,080
The last time I ever sewed as leader

359
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,880
was when I was in the Girl Scouts.

360
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,480
Well, you are only serving temporarily.

361
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,180
I'll go choose a good wine from the cellar.

362
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,080
Mr. Sugama, please go make us some light snacks that we can nibble on!

363
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,180
Yes, sir.

364
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,280
We're counting on you, leader.

365
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,680
Okay, then...

366
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,580
Sonoko, will you go check on the boy who is sick in bed?

367
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,680
Shall we line the glass cups on the table, then?

369
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
All right.

370
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,480
How's Conan doing?

371
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,580
Yep.

372
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,880
It seems his fever has come down quite a bit,

373
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,980
thanks to Mr. Doito's medicine.

374
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
I'm glad.

375
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,780
I don't think he's that bad as to disillusion you,

376
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,580
as you say, Sonoko.

377
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,380
Oh? Well, it did interest me a bit that he's a medical student.

378
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,480
But, I really wish you could've seen Mr. Hamano's magic, Ran!

379
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,580
Although he goofed at the end, he was really neat.

380
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,080
He's going to do something during the gathering too,

381
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
so come downstairs to watch, Ran.

382
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,580
But, I have to watch Conan.

383
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,280
He'll be okay! His fever already went down,

384
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,680
so no harm leaving him for an hour or two.

385
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,880
Oh, so everything's ready.

386
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,480
Sit down! Sit down!

387
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,680
Huh? Where are the others?

388
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,580
Mr. Hamano who is in charge of tonight's gathering

389
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,680
is in his room thinking up some magic!

390
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,080
Mr. Arai is in the wine cellar.

391
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,680
It sure is cold.

392
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Oh, there he is.

393
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,780
"Escape King" and "Shadow" are not here yet, are they?

394
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,480
Those two don't get along, so maybe they met some place on the way

395
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,080
and got into a fight or something.

396
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,880
They don't get along?

397
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,680
Yes, they got into an argument about a magician.

398
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,780
Well, let's not talk about unpleasant things at a time like this.

399
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,580
I don't know about "Shadow,"

400
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,580
but, I'm sure board leader, "Escape King" will be here in time.

401
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,880
-He won't come. -Huh?

402
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,780
Conan?

403
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,480
He's been killed at his apartment.

404
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,380
Killed?

405
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,580
What do you mean, Conan?

406
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,780
His name is Tsutomu Nishiyama, right?

407
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,980
Right.

408
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,080
Then, it's just as the radio said. There's no doubt about it.

409
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I came back to let you know about him.

410
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,580
And that you are all in danger.

411
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,280
Huh? Why us?

412
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
There was a message

413
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,580
left on the computer of Mr. Nishiyama who was murdered.

414
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,280
It said, "The first will be... from Shadow!"

415
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,580
"The first will be... from Shadow"

416
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,180
What?

417
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,680
Mr. Hamano also said his piece when they were having the argument

418
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
and got into hot water too.

419
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,480
We've got to let him know about this too.

420
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,980
Mr. Hamano?

421
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,180
I'm coming in, Mr. Hamano.

422
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,080
Huh? He's not here.

423
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,480
The window is open.

424
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,180
Don't tell me...

425
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
At least he hasn't fallen.

426
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,980
Hey.

427
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Look at that.

428
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,980
-Isn't that Mr. Hamano? -Oh, no.

429
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,380
It can't be.

430
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,180
Mr. Hamano?

431
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,080
What's wrong, Mr. Hamano?

432
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,780
Don't come!

433
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,280
It's no use. He's already dead.

434
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,380
Oh, no.

435
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Besides, we don't want to mess the scene up anymore than it already is.

436
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,880
The scene?

437
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,080
Can't you tell?

438
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,480
The corpse is more than 10m away from the lodge,

439
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,580
and the only footprints left are those of the man who just ran up to him.

440
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,680
But then...

441
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,280
Right. This is a crime that couldn't have been committed

442
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,880
unless the murderer had wings.

443
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,780
This is an impossible crime!
