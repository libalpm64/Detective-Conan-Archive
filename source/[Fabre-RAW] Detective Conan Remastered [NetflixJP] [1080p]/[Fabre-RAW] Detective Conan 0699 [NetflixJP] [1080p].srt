1
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:10,555
Here! This is for you, Conan.

2
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:15,455
Mystery Train pass ring?

3
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:17,997
You know! The pass that we're going to be using

4
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,255
to ride the Bell Tree Express next week.

5
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:22,855
It arrived at Doc's place this morning!

6
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,255
If you show that ring to the conductor,

7
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:29,655
he'll read it and let us own board.

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,955
Rumor has it that the train is a steam engine

9
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:36,355
and looks just like the Orient Express.

10
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:40,019
I hope that there are no murders like in Christie's novels, though.

11
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,755
Of course there aren't going to be any.

12
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:48,027
You're already wearing that ring, too?

13
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:48,955
Yes.

14
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:51,055
We all wore it at Doc's house before you got there

15
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,255
and took pictures with it, you see.

16
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,655
When we get to the campsite,

17
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,355
let's take another picture with Conan inside it, too!

18
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:00,755
Geez, take it off. What if you loose...

19
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:04,043
Do you have a cold, Conan?

20
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,555
I may have caught it from Pops

21
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:08,047
because he was coughing up last night.

22
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:11,855
Hey. At least wear a mask, won't you?

23
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:12,955
I don't have one.

24
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:14,555
Gosh.

25
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:17,455
I'll give you medicine now, then.

26
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,955
Drink this and keep quiet.

27
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,063
Where's the cold medicine?

28
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:26,065
Isn't this...

29
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,655
Here, your cold medicine.

30
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:33,155
Hey. Don't tell me that the drug that you just...

31
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:37,355
Yes. It's the antidote for Apotoxin 4869.

32
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:40,855
I keep in on me just in case.

33
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:44,083
Okay then, let me have one just in case too, then.

34
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,155
No way!

35
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:47,055
I can't give this to a love comedy detective

36
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,089
who would use it to enlarge himself all over the place.

37
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:51,355
Never mind, just give it to me!

38
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:54,455
-Hey, wait! -What's the use of you holding it?

39
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,655
You pervert!

40
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,097
What on earth are you doing?

41
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:01,455
How dare you pick on girls!

42
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,955
No. I'm the one who's being picked on.

43
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,655
Why you...

44
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,155
It's about time we get there!

45
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,955
Is everybody ready?

46
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:14,113
-Yes. -Yes.

47
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,455
Aim for a 100% solution.

48
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,555
Clear all mysteries and codes.

49
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,555
Bourbon finally makes his move?

50
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:28,127
Three shadows that close in on Ai and me.

51
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:29,455
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:31,455
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,455
His name is Detective Conan!

54
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:19,953
"Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 1)"

55
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:24,243
What? Conan went on camp?

56
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,245
How nice.

57
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,253
They said they were going to a campsite in Gunma today.

58
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:32,251
I can't see why they don't get bored going every month.

59
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:35,253
If they went to Gunma, I wonder if they went to Mt. Fuyuna?

60
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,353
I'm sure the hydrangeas are beautiful.

61
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:41,653
They told me that they'd be sending the pictures that took to my computer,

62
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,753
so I'll show them to you later.

63
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:45,753
Please do!

64
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,553
It's from Masumi.

65
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,753
Hello, Masumi?

66
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,275
Yep.

67
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:01,253
Huh? Conan told you yesterday that he was going camping, right?

68
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,753
Yep, that's right.

69
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:06,753
On Dr. Agasa's Beetle. The color is yellow.

70
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,053
But, why are you asking me this?

71
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:13,053
Geez, unbelievable!

72
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:17,053
How can he forget the canteen when coming camping?

73
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:19,553
Well, Doc and Conan is off

74
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:23,453
to buy it at a store near the campsite, so...

75
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,305
Come on, hurry help put up the tent.

76
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,653
We're going to gather firewood!

77
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:31,653
Hey, mister, mister!

78
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:34,313
From here to here is our territory!

79
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,315
Don't come in here without our permission!

80
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:37,753
Hey, Genta.

81
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:41,453
The campsite is for everybody, so let's be friendly.

82
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:49,353
From here, it's my area.

83
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,553
It's not for you to enter.

84
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,153
What was that?

85
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:59,053
Did that mean not to do anything and just stay quiet?

86
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:04,343
Or, to resign to being where I am and not fight it?

87
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:07,653
Here it it!

88
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,653
Just as would be expected of a shop at a campsite!

89
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,753
They've got all kinds of camping goods!

90
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:17,053
Maybe I'll get some rice too while we're at it.

91
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:20,153
Because Genta's always complaining that he's not eating enough.

92
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:21,353
Right!

93
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:24,953
Then, maybe I'd better buy some more canteens, too.

94
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:26,153
I guess so.

95
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:29,253
Either way, Ai's the one who's going to serve you.

96
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:33,253
I can hear her ranting over canteen.

97
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,753
Rice...

98
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,853
I prefer bread to rice any day.

99
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:42,053
Masumi?

100
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,853
It's you.

101
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,353
What bring you here?

102
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:46,653
Just a coincidence.

103
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:48,753
A passed by here by motorbike

104
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,389
and though that I'd view some hydrangea of Gunma.

105
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:53,153
I got hungry and came in here then.

106
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:56,653
I fateful ran into you!

107
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:01,353
But you're sure buying up, aren't you?

108
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,253
It's for lunch and dinner today,

109
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:05,353
and breakfast tomorrow morning.

110
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:08,407
Because you don't have anything ready for me, do you?

111
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,353
You mean you're coming camping with us, too?

112
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,953
"Danger, Snakes!" -Hey, Genta!

113
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:16,953
We've gathered enough firewood already,

114
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,953
-so let's go back to the tent, already! -Okay!

115
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:23,353
There's a sign that says "Danger Snakes" too.

116
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:26,153
Snakes?

117
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,753
Hey, everybody! Come over here!

118
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:31,153
It sounds like somebody's digging a hole!

119
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:32,431
A hole?

120
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,433
Is it buried treasure?

121
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,853
That's something we'll have to look forward, too!

122
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,953
A woman...

123
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,853
Is being buried!

124
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,053
Run!

125
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,953
They saw me...

126
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,553
Hello? Conan?

127
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,253
The cell phone you have called is...

128
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:11,553
What's this? At a time like this?

129
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,653
No one's here.

130
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:24,483
Maybe they went to pick firewood or something.

131
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,353
She followed us here, after all.

132
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:30,489
I guess I've got no choice. I'll try giving Ai a call.

133
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,253
Oh no. Battery's dead.

134
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:35,353
If your battery's dead, do you want to use my smart phone?

135
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:37,553
I bought one just like yours, too.

136
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:39,753
You're going to call the girl called Ai, right?

137
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,753
No, thanks. I can use Doc's cell phone.

138
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:44,853
Right, Doc?

139
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:48,507
I'm calling her on the cell phone I had in my knapsack,

140
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,853
but I can't seem to get through at all.

141
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:54,513
I wonder if the waves don't respond to well in this area?

142
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,153
Why don't we go look for them anyway?

143
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:00,519
You have an idea of where they may go to pick up firewood, don't you?

144
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,053
Yeah.

145
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:08,853
Are you all right, Ayumi?

146
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,529
I can't run anymore.

147
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,531
Hang in there, Ayumi.

148
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,553
Ai, there's a mountain hut over there!

149
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:23,353
Then, let's hide in that mountain hut for now.

150
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:26,545
-Yes. -Can you get up, Ayumi?

151
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,053
-Yep. -Here, grab me.

152
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:30,549
Yep.

153
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
-Let's go. -Yes!

154
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,753
If we get to that hut, we can rest ourselves.

155
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,353
Yep. Thank you, everybody.

156
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,197
"Danger, Snakes" -Where are you, everybody?

157
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:52,097
-Hey! -Answer me if you're there!

158
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:54,573
Ai!

159
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,097
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

160
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,197
This is...

161
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,585
The pass ring for the Mystery Train.

162
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:09,097
Then, they were here.

163
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:11,597
Hey. Something's strange.

164
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:14,593
There are officers in a remote mountain area like this.

165
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,595
Why on earth...

166
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,897
A corpse?

167
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,797
Hey, excuse me. What happened?

168
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,197
We got a call just a while ago.

169
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:28,597
When we got here, we found the corpse.

170
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,397
What kind of call?

171
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,611
"We're being pursued right now by a man

172
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,897
who was burying a woman near the Danger Snakes sign..."

173
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:36,297
was the contents.

174
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:38,397
It was a girl's voice.

175
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:47,297
We hid in the mountain hut for now,

176
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,597
-but will we be okay? -Yeah!

177
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:51,797
Because the door and everything is locked tightly.

178
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:54,633
Even if King Gomera were to come, we'll be fine!

179
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,797
Then, I'll go check if there are any more entrances.

180
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:02,197
Hey, Ai. Can't you get through to Conan yet?

181
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:05,397
No. It seems we're completely out of service range, too.

182
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,197
It seems that somebody's been here before us.

183
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:09,297
Huh?

184
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,697
From the looks of the bag,

185
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:13,597
I wonder if it's a couple.

186
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,397
How about it, Mitsuhiko?

187
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:19,197
There seems to be no other entrance. That's the only one.

188
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:24,097
Hey, what's the matter?

189
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:25,297
I'm fine.

190
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,997
The floor was just wet.

191
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,597
It can't be...

192
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,677
The woman a while ago was...

193
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:42,681
If so, 9 out of 10 he'll come back here

194
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,597
to this blood smeared site of the crime.

195
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,897
The culprit...

196
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:50,689
Then we'll have to hurry out of here.

197
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:51,797
True!

198
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:54,693
Let's go! Ayumi! Ai!

199
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:06,097
The man came back after all?

200
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:07,697
What?

201
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:10,397
Shall we try talking to him?

202
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,997
Maybe he's somebody who just came by to this mountain hut.

203
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,697
No doubt about it.

204
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,597
The person on the other side of the door

205
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:23,797
is the murderer who was burying the corpse a while ago!

206
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:35,797
He's probably the owner of the black bag.

207
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,737
He brought the woman that he was burying a while ago here,

208
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,397
and killed her.

209
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:42,297
But don't worry!

210
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:44,743
The only way in is this door.

211
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,897
Let's wait here until help comes.

212
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,297
-Yep. -Yes.

213
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:53,397
Ai, are you shaking?

214
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,197
I just have the chills.

215
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:57,897
Maybe I caught Conan's cold.

216
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:01,397
"Danger, Snakes" -I see. In other words...

217
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,197
About two hours ago,

218
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:05,597
there was a call saying that a man who was burying a woman

219
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:07,097
near the "Danger Snakes" sign,

220
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:09,997
and the people who witnessed this were being pursued by him.

221
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,597
We got here

222
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:14,097
and found the corpse of this woman!

223
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:18,197
And this girl who called in,

224
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,197
I think happens to be a friend of yours, no, Conan?

225
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,783
Yep! I've been trying to cal her all this time,

226
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,097
but can't seem to get through.

227
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,297
So, please hurry and search this area.

228
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:32,597
Well, the search team is already looking for them.

229
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,797
This area is quite intricate,

230
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,795
so I'm not sure if they'll be able to find them right away.

231
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,097
Oh, no.

232
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:39,997
But don't you worry.

233
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,597
For we, the Gunma Prefectural Police,

234
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:44,397
Mt. Fuyuna is like our backyard!

235
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:46,805
I'm sure that we'll be able to find the children

236
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:49,597
as well as the killer soon!

237
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:53,297
Are you really okay or not?

238
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,197
That's that.

239
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:58,597
I think we should check who this corpse is, no?

240
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,819
Huh?

241
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,597
From the looks of the death spots and rigor mortis,

242
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:06,397
she was probably killed about 5 to 6 hours ago.

243
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,197
She been slashed in the back

244
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:10,197
with what looks to be an axe.

245
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,197
But she didn't die on the spot.

246
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:14,833
She seemed to still be breathing

247
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:17,197
even after she was put inside the sleeping bag.

248
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:18,597
There are traces of her

249
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:21,697
having moved her bloody hands in the sleeping bag, too.

250
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,697
Who are you?

251
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,997
I'm Masumi Sera, a detective!

252
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:31,797
Conan's friend!

253
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,997
-Right? -Yep.

254
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:35,997
I don't know if you're a detective or what,

255
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,697
but you shouldn't be doing this.

256
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:41,197
Like touching the corpse without permission!

257
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,397
Sorry, sorry.

258
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:43,397
If sorry is going to let you get away with everything,

259
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:45,697
police aren't needed!

260
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,797
And? What's the identity of the corpse?

261
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:50,497
The thing is she has nothing on her.

262
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,397
I think she's a nursery school teacher.

263
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:54,497
Huh?

264
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:58,897
See, look. She has a bruise on her knees, right?

265
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,897
Nursery school teachers have to stand on their knees a lot

266
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:03,697
to talk eye to eye with children.

267
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:05,397
But I wonder if that's enough

268
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:08,397
to conclude that she's a nursery school teacher.

269
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:11,197
There are sports that require using the knees a lot, too.

270
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:12,497
If she was doing sports,

271
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,897
she would have marks on other parts of her body

272
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:16,297
like her elbows and hands, too!

273
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,997
If she sits Zen style a lot,

274
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:21,197
she should also have marks on her shins and top side of her feet.

275
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,901
Besides, her hair is straight

276
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:26,905
and yet the sides are unnaturally fluffy.

277
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,897
Her hair is long,

278
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:33,197
but she's tanned all the way to the nape of her neck.

279
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:35,997
This means that she normally has her hair in pigtails.

280
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:38,297
It's evident that she always out in the sun!

281
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:42,197
She looks to be around 30.

282
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:45,697
But why is her hair so childish?

283
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:46,925
So, I thought she was a nursery school teacher

284
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:47,897
who plays with children outside,

285
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:52,397
take them for walks or on excursions.

286
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:53,997
True.

287
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,197
I'll go back to the station,

288
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:58,597
and see if there are any reports of missing nursery school teachers.

289
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:01,897
If she's from another prefecture, it'll take some time.

290
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,697
If you want a clue on the culprit,

291
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,697
the shoeprints of the sneakers that he was wearing

292
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,397
when he was digging the hole should be there!

293
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,497
It's hard to tell

294
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:10,597
what the prints of the sole of the sneakers looked like,

295
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:12,951
but I think that the size of the shoes can at least be determined.

296
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,953
Let's see.

297
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,697
It's about 26 centimeters.

298
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,197
There was a shovel on the ground nearby,

299
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:22,961
but I don't think we can expect detecting fingerprints on it.

300
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,597
Because if he threw it down,

301
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,497
it's highly likely that he was wearing work gloves or something.

302
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,797
In other words, the only clue we have on the culprit

303
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:32,971
is that his shoe size is 26 cm.

304
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,897
We'll just wait for forensics to give us more information.

305
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:38,297
What're you talking about? Take a good look!

306
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,297
Huh?

307
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,997
Look, her hands!

308
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:44,397
It's unnatural, isn't it?

309
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:46,985
I see. I wonder what it is.

310
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,697
Sign language or something?

311
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,197
I wonder.

312
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:53,597
Judging from the blood stains, just before she died,

313
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,897
she must've desperately made this shape with her fingers.

314
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,097
O and K...

315
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:02,397
No. 2 and 3.

316
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,597
2 and 3... Let me see.

317
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:11,009
I got it! He might be her brother, you see!

318
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,011
-Wrong! -Wrong!

319
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,397
Inspector Yamamura.

320
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:17,015
We were contacted by the search team.

321
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:21,019
They found 3 men walking around the mountains alone,

322
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,297
and they're headed this way now.

323
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:28,597
What about the children?

324
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:33,297
Weren't the children anywhere near the place those men were found?

325
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,697
I wonder. I got no such report.

326
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:37,697
I see.

327
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,597
It's been about two hours since then.

328
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,497
There's no sound at all.

329
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,397
Maybe he gave up and fled.

330
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,397
Then, I'll go out and check things.

331
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:55,053
No! He could be ambushing us outside,

332
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,055
making us think that he left.

333
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,797
But just a little won't harm, will it?

334
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:01,997
Wait, Genta!

335
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,597
Ai, are you all right?

336
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:07,897
You're perspiring so much.

337
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:11,697
I'm fine, so please stop Genta right away.

338
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,797
But...

339
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:16,497
He already opened the door.

340
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:19,597
How is it, Genta?

341
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,997
Nobody's here.

342
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:25,497
Okay! It seems to be okay!

343
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:28,097
Huh? What's this?

344
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,097
Big trouble!

345
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:35,093
The door's chained and we can't get out!

346
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,497
Ai! We've been locked in!

347
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:43,697
Ai. Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

348
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,797
Come to think of it, yes.

349
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:48,897
It can't be...

350
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:51,397
Isn't this mountain hut burning?

351
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,097
The window! We should be able to escape from the window!

352
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,115
No good.

353
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,897
The window are nailed on.

354
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,119
No! You can't open it?

355
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,597
I see. First, he was going to confine her in here

356
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:07,797
and set the place on fire to make it look like an accident.

357
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:14,797
But she found out,

358
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:17,135
so he killed her using the axe instead.

359
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,797
But if her body is retrieved from the ashes

360
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:19,797
and the slash wound is found,

361
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,139
everything would go down the drain.

362
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,141
That's why he probably attempted to bury her corpse

363
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,897
where the Danger Snakes sign

364
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:29,497
was where people stay away from.

365
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:31,149
We've got to hurry and flee!

366
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,297
Darn it! This door won't budge!

367
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:38,097
What shall we do? We don't have the strength.

368
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,897
We'll be fine, calm down!

369
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:44,097
I'm sure someone will notice the smoke

370
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,397
and come to rescue us.

371
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:48,097
That's right.

372
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:49,697
Conan.

373
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,597
Smoke?

374
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:03,181
Hey, it's some distance away but there's smoke rising!

375
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:08,097
That's probably the smoke from a camp fire.

376
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:10,197
See, there's another one over there, too.

377
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:12,897
For some reason recently, a lot of young kids

378
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:17,195
make large bonfires from noon and really live it up.

379
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:21,697
They're reprimanded, but they keep on coming.

380
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,297
Inspector Yamamura!

381
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,097
Regarding the report we got earlier,

382
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:29,207
I brought the three men.

383
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,597
Is that right? Good work!

384
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:39,217
Then, will you all one by one give me your names, occupation

385
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:42,697
and the reason you came here.

386
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:46,397
I'm Hayamichi Yonezumi, a free-lancer.

387
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,897
I don't know what happened,

388
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,897
but I just came to check out the campsite

389
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,231
because I'll be coming here again next week with my friends!

390
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,197
My name is Chozo Usagi.

391
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:57,897
I'm a photographer.

392
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:01,897
I take pictures of campsites throughout Japan.

393
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:04,797
I wanted to take pictures of Japanese azalea

394
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,797
on my cell phone camera to upload on my blog

395
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:12,197
because they bloom orange flowers during this season.

396
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:14,597
My name's Takeya Iwakuma.

397
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,797
I'm a senior at Beika University.

398
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:20,597
But you're all dressed very lightly.

399
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:22,997
I just came to check the place out, you know.

400
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:25,263
Same with me.

401
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:28,097
My camera and equipment are in my car.

402
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:31,269
I just dropped by.

403
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:33,997
How is it?

404
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,197
I can't get though yet.

405
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,397
I'm sure that Ai would move to a place

406
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,279
where the cell phone will work.

407
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,281
If they're still being pursued by the culprit

408
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:45,283
and she can't make the call because of it,

409
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:48,997
then maybe the culprit's not among the three?

410
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:52,197
Or I don't want to think this,

411
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:55,293
but maybe they've already been killed by someone,

412
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,295
including those three.

413
00:21:57,497 --> 00:21:59,597
Or they may be in a situation

414
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,297
where that can't move for some reason.

415
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,520
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,740
"Pass Ring"

417
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,750
We're in danger.

418
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,840
Yes, we're in a grave fix.

419
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,413
Don't worry, that person will come to save us.
