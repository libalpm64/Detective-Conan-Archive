1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:04,278
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:06,178
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:06,178 --> 00:00:08,078
His girlfriend leaves home after a trivial argument.

4
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:10,378
This leads to a sad reencounter at the place where they first met.

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,878
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,678
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,478
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:58,474
And?

9
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:00,374
When is he coming?

10
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:03,174
He says he'll come after changing clothes at home.

11
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,874
Who's he?

12
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:08,374
Don't you remember? I told you the other day.

13
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:11,974
A new student who came to our class is going to come over.

14
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:14,674
Come on, Ran!

15
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,374
-Let's go! -Okay.

16
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,974
A new student?

17
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:23,974
Oh, right.

18
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:25,474
When I talked about this,

19
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:27,474
you were asleep, weren't you?

20
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:29,074
Hey.

21
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:31,674
Why is that person coming here?

22
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:34,074
Why not?

23
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:36,774
Oh, my.

24
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:41,874
This kid thinks that you got a boyfriend and is getting jealous.

25
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,974
Come on, Sonoko.

26
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,374
That's not it!

27
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,874
Then what is it?

28
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:49,574
Are you going to squeal to Shinichi about this?

29
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:51,674
I am him in person.

30
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:54,074
Too bad!

31
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,474
He's not coming here because of me.

32
00:02:58,174 --> 00:02:59,974
Hi, Ran.

33
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,374
You're back early.

34
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:03,374
I hate to ask you a favour when you just got back,

35
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:06,174
but would you give me a cup of coffee?

36
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:08,874
Unless it's the coffee you make,

37
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:12,874
it seems that my brain cells get sulky and refuse to get up.

38
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:25,274
Who are you mimicking?

39
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:27,274
Mr. Mouri, are you okay?

40
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,874
Come on!

41
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:34,674
It's only the filthy rich tempestuous girl!

42
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:37,774
What? Tempestuous?

43
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,274
-If you're talking about the one who's coming here, -Hey!

44
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:40,974
he says he's coming here later!

45
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:44,574
Is that person coming to see Pops?

46
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:47,974
Yes. He says he's a great fan of dad.

47
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:51,174
Are you relieved, glasses brat?

48
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:53,674
Sonoko, you're going to get it.

49
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:56,974
A great fan of Pops?

50
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:04,574
"The Point of No Return (Part 1)"

51
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:10,374
I was looking forward to the guest.

52
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,074
But...

53
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:17,474
what's the point of putting on airs for a high school boy?

54
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:22,474
A boy?

55
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:25,374
Huh? Wasn't she supposed to be a high school girl

56
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:28,374
who resembled Reina Mizunashi the announcer?

57
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,274
Reina Mizunashi?

58
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:41,674
I told you it was a boy student!

59
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:45,574
You used to say, "that cute kid" so I took him to be a girl.

60
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:50,374
No, Pops! Don't meet him!

61
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:55,874
He is here!

62
00:04:58,674 --> 00:04:59,674
Come in!

63
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:02,474
Pops!

64
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:17,874
Ouch.

65
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,374
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:23,874
I tripped over something.

67
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,774
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

68
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,874
It's an honour to see you!

69
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:45,174
He's Conan, who's staying with us for now.

70
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:54,274
Huh?

71
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:57,574
Like I just said, he's staying with us.

72
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,174
He's a glasses brat.

73
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:03,274
Here, your glasses!

74
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:05,974
Thank you.

75
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,974
He's my father.

76
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,674
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,374
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

78
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,474
I'm Eisuke Hondo.

79
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,174
Hello.

80
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,174
Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,374
It hurts.

82
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:31,274
It hurts.

83
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:40,274
Ouch...

84
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:43,874
What's with this guy?

85
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:49,674
I kind of understand why Ran referred to him as "the kid".

86
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:52,374
He's just a bit of a klutz.

87
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:55,174
I'm not a klutz, just unlucky!

88
00:06:56,574 --> 00:07:00,374
If I drop my toast, the buttered side will definitely fall on the ground.

89
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:05,574
If I go camping, I'm the first to get bitten by mosquitoes.

90
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,474
If I take a group picture with everyone,

91
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:11,074
for some reason I'm the only one with my eyes closed.

92
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:13,374
God must not like me!

93
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:18,774
If you were a girl, you would be a cute little klutz, but...

94
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:22,174
That's why I wanted to meet Detective Mouri!

95
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,474
Huh? Why?

96
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:28,474
I want you to share just a little bit of your good luck with me!

97
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:29,674
Good luck?

98
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:35,374
I mean, being able to solve cases while asleep is super lucky!

99
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:39,374
I'm sure that only during that time, God descends on you!

100
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,774
God? Come on.

101
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:46,674
It's true that dad is called the "Sleeping Kogoro",

102
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,174
but he's just looking down and revealing the truth,

103
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:51,474
and not really asleep, you know.

104
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:54,874
But he usually avoids answering during interviews after solving cases,

105
00:07:54,874 --> 00:08:00,274
saying things like, "I forgot", or "Ask the police", right?

106
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,874
Come to think of it...

107
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:05,374
He's just saying so because he's embarrassed!

108
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:07,174
He remembers everything.

109
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,574
Right, dad?

110
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,974
Yeah, sort of.

111
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:15,374
Please show me the "Sleeping Kogoro".

112
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:16,674
Please!

113
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:18,874
Yeah, but...

114
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,274
He's a load of trouble.

115
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:25,174
Excuse me.

116
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:28,674
"Atsushi Misumi (32)" -Is this the Mouri Detective Agency?

117
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,674
Yes.

118
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:35,674
You touched my breasts! How dare he touch me!

119
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:39,274
Are you here to ask him to solve a case?

120
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:42,174
Sort of.

121
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:45,074
Detective Mouri! He wants you to solve a case!

122
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,774
All right!

123
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:48,874
Not again.

124
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:51,174
Ouch. Not again.

125
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,274
My nose...

126
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,774
A born klutz. Goodness.

127
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,974
Please don't let it bother you.

128
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:10,874
Oh, okay.

129
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:17,974
You want me to find your girlfriend who disappeared?

130
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,274
Yes.

131
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:20,974
I'm living with her,

132
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:24,474
but this morning when I got up, she was gone.

133
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:25,774
The reason she left

134
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:30,574
is probably because of the argument we had last night.

135
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:34,474
If it's okay with you, would you please tell me what you argued about?

136
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,874
Oh, yes.

137
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:40,874
Hey!

138
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,074
You guys, go away.

139
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:44,874
It's okay!

140
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:48,374
It's just the usual argument that anybody has.

141
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,374
I see.

142
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:51,474
Okay.

143
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,674
Right.

144
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:57,774
I've been busy lately and unable to spend much time with her.

145
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:00,274
That's what triggered our argument,

146
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:03,374
but after having said what we both wanted to say...

147
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:05,374
You've changed!

148
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:07,774
And I haven't changed at all!

149
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,774
We are at the point of no return.

150
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,974
We can never go back to how when we first met.

151
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:15,774
After that remark, she didn't say anything and went to sleep.

152
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:19,174
When I got up in the morning, she and the car were gone.

153
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:24,174
It sure sounds like any other lover's quarrel.

154
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,974
The possibility of this being a criminal case is very low.

155
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,974
She just simply left.

156
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:34,474
I'm sure she'll return in two to three days.

157
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:36,374
I can't wait that long!

158
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,274
Tomorrow I have to turn in some documents to the company,

159
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:41,874
but I left it in the car that she took!

160
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,474
So I need to find her by today no matter what!

161
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:51,174
Of course I'm worried about her, too.

162
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:52,774
I see.

163
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:56,374
I understand, but there's so little to go on.

164
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:58,274
Hey.

165
00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:59,674
Did she know

166
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:03,474
that you had important papers from your company in the car?

167
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:05,174
Yeah.

168
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:09,174
If so, she could just be trying to be mean to you.

169
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,374
Trying to be mean?

170
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:16,174
Yeah! I think she wants you to come look for her,

171
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:19,974
to the place where you both played Japanese Parcheesi in the past.

172
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,374
Japanese Parcheesi?

173
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:23,074
Just what does that mean?

174
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:24,074
Remember?

175
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:28,374
He said a while ago, "We're at a point of no return."

176
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:31,474
Isn't that about Parcheesi?

177
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,874
When I played Parcheesi with Ran the other day,

178
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:36,374
I hit the point of no return, too!

179
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:40,874
Ran, are you playing Parcheesi with this glasses brat?

180
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,474
It's the TV game "Budori Street".

181
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:45,274
Conan is good at it.

182
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:50,674
You're so stupid.

183
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,274
The point of no return that he's talking about

184
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:56,874
is not being able to return to how they used to be when they first met.

185
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:08,274
Maybe she's where you both first met each other?

186
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,574
Right, right.

187
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:13,674
After having a fight, if she wants to be mean and make you find her,

188
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:15,174
that could be the ideal place.

189
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,774
Anyway, Mr. Misumi...

190
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,074
What is it?

191
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,474
Where did you first meet her?

192
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:23,574
Right.

193
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,074
At a ski range in Gunma.

194
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,666
That's why I told you not to come.

195
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,066
Are you all right, Eisuke?

196
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,266
See.

197
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,666
In situations like these, I'm the first one to catch a cold.

198
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:54,866
It's snowing so hard, so maybe Sonoko was right not wanting to come.

199
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,566
Gunma?

200
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,966
It'll be covered in snow this time of the year.

201
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,566
I'm sorry, Ran. Would you mind me not going this time?

202
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,566
Right.

203
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,666
Hey, don't you give your cold to Ran.

204
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,866
I'm fine. Because Conan's so warm.

205
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,866
Same here.

206
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:15,966
And?

207
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:20,366
Did you two really meet on this freezing mountain?

208
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,666
Yes.

209
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:26,966
She drove here with three of her friends,

210
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,766
but when she drove through the short cut of the mountain road here,

211
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:32,766
the engine stopped and they were stalled.

212
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:35,966
What seems to be the matter?

213
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:39,366
We're in a fix because our car stopped moving.

214
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:42,666
No cars have passed by either.

215
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,666
I'm so glad.

216
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:49,366
So, the place where we first met is the road just up ahead.

217
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:57,866
On the other side of that tree!

218
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:58,966
That's my car!

219
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:07,966
Case closed, I guess.

220
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,366
Ami? Ami?

221
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,766
Hey, Ami! Get a hold of yourself!

222
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,066
Hey! What is it?

223
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,966
I'll go check!

224
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:30,966
Wait.

225
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:48,266
The space between both doors are sealed tightly with masking tape.

226
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,066
There is a portable clay charcoal stove by the passenger's seat.

227
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,166
Suicide?

228
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,666
Where's the key? Don't you have a spare key?

229
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,366
I do!

230
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,266
Darn it!

231
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:15,666
It's sealed tight with masking tape. It won't open.

232
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,166
I guess we'll have to call the police and break it open using tools.

233
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,566
Please stay back.

234
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,566
Where did you get that bat?

235
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:39,466
I always keep a bat for playing a sandlot game in the trunk of my car.

236
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,766
Ami! I'll get you out of there right now!

237
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:45,966
Ami!

238
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,666
Ami!

239
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,166
Ami?

240
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:09,166
Peel off the masking tape on the door of the car for now!

241
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,366
Yes, sir!

242
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:15,066
But it's very tightly sealed.

243
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,366
It's hard to peel all of it off.

244
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,366
That's right.

245
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,366
There should be a cutter in here.

246
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:43,966
Ami?

247
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,466
Get a hold of yourself, Ami!

248
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,266
Ami?

249
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,466
From the looks of it, she's already dead.

250
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:52,666
Oh, no.

251
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,866
Ami! Ami!

252
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,766
Ami! Hey, Ami!

253
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:14,466
I guess I'll call an ambulance as well as the Gunma police.

254
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,266
I called them a while ago.

255
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:21,866
I was told that an officer who is a great partner of yours is coming!

256
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,966
Hey. Don't tell me that it's...

257
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,066
So it's him after all.

258
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:36,666
What makes us great partners?

259
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:40,366
Just what do think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:44,666
Every case we've worked on together has been solved!

261
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,966
It's 100%!

262
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,966
Then what about all the other cases?

263
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,766
Well, you see...

264
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:55,766
All the other cases aren't solved.

265
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:59,766
Let's leave the tidbits aside and start the investigation.

266
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:03,466
I'm going to get a picture of the Sleeping Kogoro for sure today.

267
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,166
I'm sorry to say this, but that won't be possible.

268
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:11,566
Look at the car that the woman was in.

269
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:15,766
The door is sealed tight from the inside of the car with masking tape.

270
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,566
There is a portable charcoal stove by the passenger's seat

271
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,866
with burned remains of solid fuel.

272
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,966
The woman was carried out of the car

273
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,766
after cracking the windshield with a metal bat.

274
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,566
Because that was the only way to get in or out of the car.

275
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:33,366
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning,

276
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:35,666
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

277
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,766
There's no doubt that she committed suicide.

278
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,166
-What? -What?

279
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,066
-It means we don't get to see... -It means we don't get to see...

280
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,966
-the Sleeping Kogoro at work? -the Sleeping Kogoro at work?

281
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:46,966
Who is this young lad?

282
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:52,466
Oh, he's just a high school fan that came along with us.

283
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,766
A fan of Mr. Mouri?

284
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,866
Yes, sir!

285
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:57,766
How do you do? I'm Eisuke Hondo!

286
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:00,566
This is the first time I'm meeting a real police detective,

287
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,766
so I'm really excited!

288
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:06,366
I'm Officer Yamamura of the Gunma Police Department.

289
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:09,266
You can call me Mr. Yama.

290
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,866
They make a great pair.

291
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,666
-Mr. Yamamura. -Yes?

292
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,766
Sleeping drug was detected from the canned coffee on the car floor.

293
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,366
A sleeping drug?

294
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:29,866
Anxious of whether she could really die or not,

295
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:32,166
I think she drank it just be sure she would succeed.

296
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,866
I see!

297
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,266
If so...

298
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:40,466
the woman must've had really bad sleeping posture.

299
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,766
What?

300
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:45,266
She was sitting nicely in the driver's seat, wasn't she?

301
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:51,866
But I saw a folded part on the top of her clothes near her hips.

302
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,166
She would most likely be bothered

303
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,966
if she was sitting nicely and fix it right away.

304
00:19:55,966 --> 00:20:00,566
So the crease was probably made while she was asleep, right?

305
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,366
It seems to have been so.

306
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:06,566
And the same goes for the driver's seat.

307
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,566
What?

308
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,366
Come with me, Ran.

309
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,866
Okay.

310
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,666
Bend down beside the car

311
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,466
and pretend that you're holding the steering wheel.

312
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,966
Oh, okay.

313
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,666
Like this?

314
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:27,366
See? The woman was in the same position that Ran is now,

315
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,766
so isn't the seat too far back for her?

316
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,766
Maybe she had bad sleeping posture

317
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,166
so she pushed her seat back before going to sleep.

318
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,666
It's true.

319
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:41,966
The seat is too far back for the woman to have been driving.

320
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:45,266
Isn't that probably because she moved the seat back

321
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:47,566
in order to place the portable charcoal stove at the feet?

322
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:48,966
I see.

323
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,166
She put it at her feet,

324
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,766
but moved it over to the passenger's seat because it was too hot.

325
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,366
By the way, who are you?

326
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:57,466
Right.

327
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,466
I was dating the woman who committed suicide in this car.

328
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,866
I'm Atsushi Misumi.

329
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:05,366
I'm so sorry. My condolences.

330
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:09,766
And? Did she have bad sleeping posture?

331
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:10,866
Yes.

332
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:13,766
She didn't have very good sleeping posture.

333
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,266
I see.

334
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:18,266
Then it is suicide after all.

335
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,866
I guess so.

336
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:30,666
No.

337
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,166
This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

338
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,866
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

339
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,966
that man.

340
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,366
But I don't understand.

341
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:45,166
How did he get out of the sealed car?

342
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:08,166
The car was sealed tightly from the inside with masking tape.

343
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,566
And to keep her in the seat...

344
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:15,266
What kind of trick did he use?

345
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,760
Next Conan's Hint:

346
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,900
"Bandage"

347
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,360
I have a stomachache so give me bandage.

348
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,560
I don't think it will cure your stomachache.

349
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,800
Is that so?
