1
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,479
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:07,479
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:08,879
The client is a famous child star.

4
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:10,879
Search for mother ends up in a hot spring dive.

5
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:12,479
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,179
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,279
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,430
If I get married,

9
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,430
what are you going to do, Kanichi?

10
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,730
So, you're going to get married after all.

11
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,330
I try so hard to stop you,

12
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,430
but you just won't listen.

13
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,930
Dad.

14
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,930
Why you...

15
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,630
Pops...

16
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,430
Dad.

17
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,830
Hey, Dad, are you listening to me?

18
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,630
Shut up. Be quiet, will you?

19
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,530
This is Yoko's best scene, you know.

20
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,730
Kanichi, I will never forget you.

21
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,330
This is the scene of the beach in Atami

22
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,630
where Kanichi and Omiya appear in the story "Konjiki Yasha", right?

23
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,830
Just how many times are you going to watch that video?

24
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,630
I, Kanichi will go mad of extreme grief...

25
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,230
Hey, Ran!

26
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,130
Never mind the video.

27
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,930
Tell me why you refused Mom's invitation

28
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,330
to go eat together!

29
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,930
Oh, yeah. That day's inconvenient for me.

30
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,330
May I ask in just what way is it inconvenient for you?

31
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,730
Who cares?

32
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,930
I mean, it's not that she's dead or anything

33
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,230
and we get to see her anytime.

34
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,830
"Konjiki Yasha" was never completed

35
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,530
because the author died while he was still writing the story.

36
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,830
So the two characters in the series

37
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,330
lost their way to happiness forever.

38
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,130
In our case, we're going to see it through

39
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,630
and make it no matter what.

40
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,630
I hope you're not thinking

41
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,130
of trying to get Eri and me back together again, are you?

42
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,630
Of course I am!

43
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,730
It's only natural for kids

44
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,630
to want to live happily with both their parents, isn't it?

45
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,330
That's nonsense.

46
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,630
There are people who abhor even looking at their parent's faces.

47
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,330
"Kazuki Kinukawa (7), Talent"

48
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,630
And I'm one of them.

49
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,430
What's with this brat?

50
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,030
Huh?

51
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,130
You sure look familiar.

52
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,930
Are you by any chance,

53
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,030
Kazuki Kinukawa, the popular child actor

54
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,430
who acts in dramas and movies?

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,130
Yeah, I am.

56
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,530
You're even cuter than you look on TV!

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,130
And? What does that famous brat

58
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,730
want with our detective office here?

59
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,130
I want you to look for somebody.

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,330
A woman called Atsuko who keeps sending me

61
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,130
postcards like these.

62
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,930
"The Little Client (Part 1)"

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,730
It's true that all there is here is the name of the sender

64
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,630
and no address.

65
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,630
Wait a minute. Aren't these fan letters?

66
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,030
It's full of comments

67
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,830
about the dramas and movies that you acted in!

68
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,230
She seems to be a really great fan of yours.

69
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,530
She's sent you postcards

70
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,930
once every month from spring two years ago

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,830
to winter last year.

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,830
But all of them are stained and wrinkled up.

73
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,330
You should put these away nicely if they're fan letters.

74
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,730
I can't help it, can I?

75
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,430
They gave me the creeps, so I just kind of left them lying around.

76
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,730
Give you the creeps?

77
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,230
Because they're not fan letters.

78
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,330
They're postcards from my mother.

79
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,630
Your mother?

80
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,630
Yeah.

81
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,830
They're postcards from a stupid lady,

82
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,430
who abandoned me in front of the door of a church

83
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,630
as if I were a piece of trash six years ago.

84
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,230
I see. That's why you mentioned

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,830
not wanting to see your parent's face.

86
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,130
But if you want us to look for her,

87
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,530
it means that you want to see her after all.

88
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,930
Don't get me wrong.

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,730
I just want to see the lady and give her a piece of my mind.

90
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,630
I want to tell her not to claim being my mother

91
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,330
at this point just because I'm famous now!

92
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,330
But it's amazing how you figured out it was your mother.

93
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,830
It doesn't say so anywhere.

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,130
I can tell.

95
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,230
Because the name and the handwriting on the postcard

96
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,230
are the same as they were on the memo

97
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,030
that was left with me when she abandoned me.

98
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,730
Looking for her is not going to be easy though.

99
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,430
The postcards are stamped from different places,

100
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,330
all the way from Hokkaido to Okinawa.

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,730
You can tell that she really likes to travel.

102
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,330
Never mind then.

103
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,230
I'll go look for another detective that will search for her.

104
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,230
I think that your mother's in a hotel or inn

105
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,830
some place in Atami.

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,430
Where is it written?

107
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,730
Look at this postcard.

108
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,130
There is something that looks like the hand

109
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,930
and head of a statue on the bottom part, right?

110
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,230
Doesn't this statue look familiar?

111
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,430
Now that you mentioned it, it does look familiar.

112
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,230
I see!

113
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,430
It's this!

114
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,530
It looks just like this pose

115
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,230
which means it's probably the statue of Kanichi and Omiya

116
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,330
at the beach in Atami!

117
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,930
She probably used the top part of the postcard set

118
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,630
which was made up of four postcards.

119
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,630
It could be that she used something that she bought as a souvenir too.

120
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,330
But there are three other postcards like it too.

121
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,830
And they're all the upper left ones.

122
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,630
If she's rich enough to travel to inns throughout Japan,

123
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,830
I think she would send all four types of postcards.

124
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,430
And I'm sure that postcards of other places

125
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,030
would be mixed among them, right?

126
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,330
I get it! I think your mother

127
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,830
didn't want you to know where she was,

128
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,030
so she sent only the postcards on the top left

129
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,230
because it's the hardest to tell from these

130
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,930
that it's the statue of Kanichi and Omiya.

131
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,130
She probably used postcards that remained

132
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,130
after everything else was sold out

133
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,930
from the shop at a hotel or an inn.

134
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,830
Then she probably gave it to the guests that came to stay,

135
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,130
asking them to send the postcard out

136
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,030
after they returned to their homes.

137
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,130
I see.

138
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,230
People from all over Japan come to hotels or inn,

139
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,830
so if we check the hotel roster,

140
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,030
we can figure out where they came from.

141
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,230
Which means your mother is

142
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,630
an employee of a hotel or an inn.

143
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,330
Why don't we take a drive to Atami either way?

144
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,230
Well, I don't see why not.

145
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,030
But you're going to pay the fee if we find her, right?

146
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,730
Yes, a whole lot.

147
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,630
Unlike that lady, I'm rich.

148
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,230
Come on, let's go and get it over with.

149
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,930
My schedule's open only today and tomorrow.

150
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,730
What a nasty kid.

151
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,830
You're kind of like Conan.

152
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,130
How dare you...

153
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,830
No, I have no idea.

154
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,030
We don't carry postcards like these here.

155
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,230
I see.

156
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,630
Thank you very much.

157
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,530
We came all the way to Atami

158
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,130
and we're sweating it out here

159
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,130
without even going to a hot spring.

160
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,730
Maybe a postcard doesn't suffice as a lead after all.

161
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,130
Ran.

162
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,430
Carry me please!

163
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,830
If you're tired, I'll piggy back you.

164
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,030
I want to be carried!

165
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,930
I want to be hugged, not be piggy backed!

166
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,230
Hey, you...

167
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,230
Talk about being spoiled.

168
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,630
-Hey. -I think this is the spot

169
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,830
where that lady had a mole.

170
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,830
Huh?

171
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,530
I remember going to sleep

172
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,230
and seeing the mole in front of my eyes.

173
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,330
But I was much smaller back then,

174
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,330
so maybe it was further down.

175
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,930
Hey, if it was further down...

176
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,930
Well, will you carry me one more time?

177
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,530
Okay.

178
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,530
You don't have to do that.

179
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,530
We already have an idea on where it is.

180
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,730
But I want to be sure...

181
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,330
You don't have to. We already know.

182
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,130
What? You used to sell it?

183
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,530
Do you mean this postcard?

184
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,630
Yes.

185
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,430
It was a limited product that was only sold here,

186
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,230
but these sets of four postcards didn't sell too well.

187
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,530
"Mitsu Kusano (34)" -Having no other choice,

188
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,230
"Female employee" -we divided them among ourselves

189
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,130
since we couldn't return them to the publisher either.

190
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,030
Amazing! It's just like you said, Conan.

191
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,930
Please excuse me for asking this inappropriate question.

192
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,930
Is there a woman

193
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,730
by the name of Atsuko working here?

194
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,030
No, there's no one by that name here.

195
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,930
Is that so?

196
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,530
By any chance, are you that famous...

197
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,030
Yes. I'm the famous Detective Mouri.

198
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,630
Kazuki Kinukawa?

199
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,930
Yes.

200
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,930
Oh, my. Just as I thought!

201
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,530
Come over here, Ms. Bessho!

202
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,030
It's Kazuki!

203
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,830
"Toshika Bessho (29), Female employee"

204
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,430
Hello...

205
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,030
That's strange.

206
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,430
She's a fervent fan of yours.

207
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,030
I wonder if she's shy.

208
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,130
So? What's up today?

209
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,730
Did you come to spend the night here?

210
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,330
Well, the thing is...

211
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,730
I'll bet you came to look for her.

212
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,430
"Yasuhiro Kamoshita (37)" -Your mother...

213
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,730
"Freelance writer" -who abandoned you.

214
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,030
Hey, who are you anyway?

215
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,030
A guest. I'm just a guest.

216
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,330
I'm Kamoshita, the one who reserved room 205.

217
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,730
I came here just to check things out,

218
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,730
but I guess it's my lucky day

219
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,730
to have the entire cast out here.

220
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,930
This is surely going to make a great story.

221
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,330
How come he knows about the kid's mother?

222
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,830
Will you be spending the night here?

223
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,330
Why don't we stay?

224
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,630
Maybe Kazuki's mother

225
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,430
is working here under a different name.

226
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,030
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

227
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,630
I was planning to stay anyway.

228
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,030
That's great!

229
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,930
Then, I can stay a while longer with Kazuki.

230
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,030
Okay, then.

231
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,430
Ms. Saegusa.

232
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,330
"Tomoka Saegusa (28)" -Please show them to room 308

233
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,730
"Female employee" -where we had a cancellation.

234
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,730
Yes.

235
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,230
This is room 308.

236
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,130
The yukata and mattresses are in the closet,

237
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,530
so help yourselves.

238
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,230
Hey!

239
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,330
Can't you be a bit more explicit?

240
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,030
Quiet. We're so busy as it is

241
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,430
that we can't be bothered with extra guests, you know.

242
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,130
Don't push your weight around just because you're a bit famous!

243
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,030
Is that the right attitude towards their guests?

244
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,630
You gave me your word, editor.

245
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,930
Keep a page open for me, okay?

246
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,330
If this isn't duff gen, the book will sell well.

247
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,830
Because it's about the number one kid actor,

248
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,630
Kazuki Kinukawa's father

249
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,630
being a killer.

250
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:43,043
I'm really full.

251
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:47,943
Thanks to you, we end up taking a bath so late.

252
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,043
You drink too much beer.

253
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,643
What's the matter?

254
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:02,043
Oh, it's the cap of a camera lens.

255
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:05,143
Could this belong to the Kamoshita guy we saw a while ago?

256
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:06,843
Now that you mentioned it...

257
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,843
I'll go give it to him.

258
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:11,943
I'm sure he said he was staying in room 205.

259
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,843
Hey, Ran! Let him be! He's so weird!

260
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:20,343
I tell you. She doesn't give a hoot about anything I say.

261
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,643
Guys and girls get to go in together?

262
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:27,743
I hope somebody's inside!

263
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:28,843
How silly.

264
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:31,443
At this time of night, I doubt anybody is inside.

265
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:35,943
Gosh!

266
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:37,343
Oh, good evening.

267
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:40,943
Excuse me.

268
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,043
Please help yourself.

269
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,843
Being able to take a bath with Kazuki

270
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:46,343
will be a memory of a life time!

271
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:47,643
But...

272
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,043
Quit being a prude.

273
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:53,743
Oh, I just noticed that all three of you

274
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:57,643
have such attractive moles.

275
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,843
Do you always take a bath at this time?

276
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:10,143
Yes. We wait till all the guests are done.

277
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:13,943
By the way, where's the girl that was with you?

278
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,543
My daughter, Ran, went to Mr. Kamoshita's room

279
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:17,743
to deliver something he dropped.

280
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,243
Ran?

281
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:27,543
Ran!

282
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:30,143
Don't tell me that guy had the nerve to touch her!

283
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:32,643
Hey, what's wrong?

284
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,443
That...

285
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:48,643
Did he drown?

286
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,643
No. The trace on his neck

287
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,443
shows that he was strangled.

288
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,543
Hey, look. There's a cell phone on the floor.

289
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:56,943
What?

290
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,943
A picture seems to have been saved just a while ago.

291
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:01,943
Don't tell me the killer's picture is...

292
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,143
This is...

293
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:06,643
a mole on a woman's chest?

294
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:13,443
I see.

295
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,643
So you picked up Mr. Yasuhiro Kamoshita's camera cap in the corridor

296
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:18,743
and delivered it to his room,

297
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,443
where you found Mr. Kamoshita dead.

298
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:22,943
Is that right?

299
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:23,943
Yes.

300
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,943
Just as Mr. Mouri had said,

301
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,643
it seems he was strangled

302
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,143
with a thin string-like thing.

303
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:36,143
If so, was the body put inside the bath tub

304
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,043
to complicate our job of determining the estimated time of death?

305
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:43,943
But the killer could not deceive me, Kogoro Mouri!

306
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,043
Just what do you mean?

307
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,843
It's in this camera.

308
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,843
Inside Mr. Kamoshita's cell phone...

309
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:51,043
Wait.

310
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:54,743
I don't think you should say that yet.

311
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,043
Why not?

312
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,743
Oh, my.

313
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,643
You're the one who appears on TV a lot.

314
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:04,843
I'm Kazuki Kinugawa.

315
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,143
He came with us to this inn

316
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,343
because of some personal matter.

317
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,843
I see.

318
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,743
All right. You kids go back to the room.

319
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,943
Inspector Yokomizo.

320
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:17,443
According to the people of the inn,

321
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,343
Mr. Kamoshita called one of the waitresses

322
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,343
and said something weird.

323
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:23,743
Something weird?

324
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,443
He said, "If 20 million yen sounds familiar to you,

325
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,243
then come to my room.

326
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:31,043
If you don't, I'll disclose everything."

327
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,543
I have no idea what the 20 million yen is about,

328
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,243
but Mr. Kamoshita must've had hold

329
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:40,143
of something the waitress wanted to keep secret.

330
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,543
If so, it's seems like we already have the killer.

331
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,143
We can look at the picture in his cell phone.

332
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,743
All we have to do is find a waitress

333
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:51,343
who had no alibi at the time the picture was taken here.

334
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,443
This is indeed a picture of the murder site!

335
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:57,243
See. It's shown below, isn't it?

336
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,643
It says 11:48 pm.

337
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,343
There is a mole on the chest of the woman

338
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:05,443
who was choking Mr. Kamoshita's neck from behind.

339
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:06,543
Bummers.

340
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:07,743
There's no doubt about it!

341
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:11,643
The killer is a woman with a mole on her chest, Mr. Mouri!

342
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:12,643
True.

343
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,843
That means the killer is...

344
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:17,443
The killer is my...

345
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:20,543
Kazuki?

346
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,043
Wipe yourself.

347
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,643
Kazuki, where are you?

348
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:57,343
You came to this inn to look for Kazuki Kinukawa's mother.

349
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,343
Yeah.

350
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,043
The clue to his mother

351
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,843
was that she has a mole on her chest.

352
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:04,643
But I didn't think that there'd be a mole

353
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,443
on the chest of this killer too.

354
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,243
It's obvious, isn't it?

355
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:10,143
I wonder if Mr. Kamoshita is the one

356
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,543
who really took this picture.

357
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:14,243
The picture is static

358
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:17,143
and conveniently, the face of the killer was not taken.

359
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:20,643
It could be that the killer took this picture deliberately

360
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,143
and rigged the time and date on it

361
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,843
to create an alibi.

362
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:26,643
I don't think so.

363
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:30,043
Not him again.

364
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,543
Because the killer had the string around the man's neck

365
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,843
and was pulling the string with both hands, right?

366
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,143
The killer couldn't have pressed the shutter

367
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,543
with both hands full!

368
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:41,343
Besides, if the killer took the picture,

369
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:42,543
I think she would wear some clothes

370
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:45,543
so that you can't tell if it's a man or a woman.

371
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,043
You're right.

372
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,743
The killer probably didn't know that a picture was being taken.

373
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,443
Right, Pops?

374
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:53,743
Yeah.

375
00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:55,943
Why did Mr. Kamoshita have his cell phone on him

376
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:58,943
when he was being attacked by the killer?

377
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,243
Maybe he was talking to somebody?

378
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,943
Then, why don't you try the re-dial button?

379
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,843
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

380
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,643
It seems he was talking to someone

381
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,943
10 minutes before he took the picture.

382
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,543
"Tohto Publications"

383
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,743
What? Kamoshita was?

384
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,043
Are you serious, officer?

385
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,143
Yes. If you don't mind,

386
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:21,443
I'd like you to give me your name and tell me what you do.

387
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:24,743
I'm Izumiya, the editor of "Weekly Hot" magazine.

388
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,343
Kamoshita is a writer

389
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,743
who brings us a lot of scoop articles.

390
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,143
He called to tell me

391
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:32,143
that the woman with the scoop story

392
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,943
came to his room a little after 11:30 pm.

393
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,643
He said that the woman wanted to take a shower in his room

394
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,643
to wash off her sweat before the interview.

395
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,043
He also told me not to worry

396
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:44,443
because he'd make sure that he took a picture of the woman

397
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:45,943
with his cell phone.

398
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,343
And who is this woman with the scoop?

399
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:51,443
The mother called Atsuko, who left the kid actor, Kazuki Kinugawa,

400
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:55,043
in front of the door of a church when he was a baby.

401
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:58,443
She seems to be a devil threatening Kazuki's agency

402
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,143
to dish out 20 million yen

403
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,843
if they didn't want her to publicize the fact

404
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:05,943
that his father is a fugitive for killing somebody.

405
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:09,243
Although the agency didn't really believe her story at first,

406
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,743
she knew the name of the church

407
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,443
as well as the characteristics of Kazuki's body in detail,

408
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:16,643
so they deposited the amount into her account.

409
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:19,043
Since all their dealings were carried out by e-mail,

410
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,643
he had no idea of what she looked like or how she sounded.

411
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,943
Kamoshita, who smelled that there was a scoop,

412
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:28,743
went to interview her in person.

413
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:31,143
That's why he brought up the 20,000,000 yen

414
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:34,143
to see if anybody would come up front.

415
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:35,743
Inspector.

416
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:40,643
The waitresses that have no alibi after 11:48 pm are here.

417
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,043
What? You are...

418
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,743
Hello again.

419
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,943
So? What do you want from us?

420
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,543
Did something happen?

421
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,643
There was a murder.

422
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,943
A man called Mr. Kamoshita, who was staying in this room

423
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,543
was strangled to death.

424
00:20:58,543 --> 00:20:59,543
What?

425
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,743
-No way. -Are you serious?

426
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:08,043
I'll have to check your bodies a little bit

427
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:10,843
and see if any one of you has a mole like this on your chest

428
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:13,043
like the killer whose picture was taken

429
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:15,843
when she killed Mr. Kamoshita.

430
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:17,043
Wait a minute.

431
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,843
Are you telling us to strip naked right here?

432
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,143
What?

433
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:22,943
No, of course a female police will be here

434
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:25,243
and you'll be checked in another room.

435
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,943
Okay then.

436
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,043
Then hurry up and get on with it.

437
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:31,143
We still have work left to do.

438
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:33,643
There's no need for that!

439
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:36,443
See! I have no mole.

440
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:41,943
Hey, Ms. Bessho.

441
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:44,943
Right. It's not like we're going to lose anything.

442
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:49,843
Go on, Ms. Kusano.

443
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,143
They're going to suspect you if you don't.

444
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:53,143
All right.

445
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:57,943
Cool it, Pops.

446
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,243
You have a mole on your chest!

447
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:03,943
Take a good look, will you?

448
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:06,543
My mole is on the opposite side when compared to the picture.

449
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:07,543
Oh, yeah.

450
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,343
Rather than checking on our moles,

451
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,443
why don't you go check the fingerprints on the murder weapon?

452
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:12,943
You found it, didn't you?

453
00:22:12,943 --> 00:22:15,843
The black string that was in the picture a while ago.

454
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:19,843
Well, we've been looking for it for a while,

455
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:23,543
but we can't find it anywhere.

456
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,643
The black string that is estimated

457
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,543
to be over a meter long.

458
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:31,043
Right. The problems are the murder weapon

459
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:33,943
and that mole.

460
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,570
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,270
"Video tapes"

462
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,570
The next episode also takes place at a hot spring.

463
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,270
-Don't catch a cold! -Brush your teeth!

464
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,070
Tune in again next week!
