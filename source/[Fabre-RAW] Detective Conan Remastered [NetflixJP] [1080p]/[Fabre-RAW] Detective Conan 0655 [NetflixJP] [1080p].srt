1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,329
Hey, Shinichi.

2
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:08,429
Do you think that Mrs. Wakamatsu is the culprit too?

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,991
Yeah. I was positive.

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,995
Until I went into that study where she was found dead.

5
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:17,997
Me, too.

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,429
It's hard to believe that a person who is contemplating suicide

7
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,029
would ask for tea to be served again or use eye drops.

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,029
Moreover, the signature on the contract was only half written,

9
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,229
and the cap of the fountain pen wasn't closed either.

10
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:32,529
Yeah.

11
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:34,629
It's as if a ghost who came in here

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:38,829
without anybody noticing.

13
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,021
Poisoned her to death while she was signing her name.

14
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,429
Yeah.

15
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:46,729
Like the one who sent the weird letter to you...

16
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:52,031
The warped entity that cannot be seen normally.

17
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,629
If all cases were men,

18
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:15,329
all hidden mysteries are women.

19
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:17,029
Don't let what you see deceive you.

20
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:18,829
The trick that the real culprit used.

21
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,529
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:22,329
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,929
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:55,250
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Illusion)"

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,881
But nobody came inside the study until we came.

26
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,881
And even if someone were to give Mrs. Wakamatsu orders over the phone

27
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,181
wanting to frame her.

28
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:08,167
The four suspects were undergoing voluntary on site investigation,

29
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,581
so they couldn't have done anything like that.

30
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:13,481
And those slippers with poison on them...

31
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:16,881
If somebody was planning to frame her,

32
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,681
the slippers would have had to been switched somewhere.

33
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:21,581
It would be impossible to do something like that

34
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,481
without being suspected?

35
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,185
What's wrong?

36
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,191
What's with these slippers?

37
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,781
They're Kazuha's!

38
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,081
Since there are slippers inside for restroom use,

39
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,881
you'd normally leave yours outside.

40
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,681
That's right! The restroom!

41
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,681
It's possible to switch slippers here!

42
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,481
What's going on?

43
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:47,881
Why are all of you in front of the bathroom that I'm using?

44
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,781
Kazuha. You used the restroom

45
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,381
right after you came to this house, didn't you?

46
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,081
Huh? Yeah.

47
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,881
And, when you came to the living room where we waiting, you said,

48
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:58,881
"The restroom was so crowded that I had a hard time." Didn't you?

49
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,481
Yeah.

50
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,981
I went to the restroom then, too.

51
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:07,081
Then, didn't Mrs. Wakamatsu use the restroom back then too?

52
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,581
No.

53
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,581
The person who was in the restroom before us was...

54
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:12,881
Ikuro!

55
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:15,881
He went towards the living room as soon as he came out.

56
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,681
I heard the voice of Managing Director Shiina

57
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:22,241
ask us if we bought baumkuchen.

58
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,981
-Is that true? -Yeah.

59
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,581
While wiping his hands...

60
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,247
He was in high spirits.

61
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,251
If so, the poison that was on the door knob of Ikuro's room was...

62
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,681
Foul play!

63
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,781
If so, there should be something after all.

64
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:41,081
A way to make only Ikuro pick up the poison baumkuchen.

65
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,281
But, back then,

66
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,581
there were to pieces of baumkuchen on the tray!

67
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,381
How was he directed to pick up a certain piece of baumkuchen

68
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:49,581
when the pieces were both the same size and same shape?

69
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:54,273
I hate to say this at a time like this.

70
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:57,081
-But I'm getting hungry. -Yeah.

71
00:04:57,081 --> 00:05:00,981
Talking about baumkuchen is making me want to eat fishcake.

72
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,581
Huh? Why fishcake?

73
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,181
The shape, kind of looks alike!

74
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,981
They're both somewhat arched, see...

75
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,181
I get it!

76
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,381
An eye for an eye.

77
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,881
If so, it's understandable why Mrs. Wakamatsu was killed.

78
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:21,581
A similar method of doing it is highly likely!

79
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,581
Hey.

80
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,881
Strange.

81
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:30,781
Dad said that the case was already closed and yet...

82
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,981
No, it's not closed yet.

83
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,781
When Heiji turns the brim of his cap to the front,

84
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,681
the investigation's still on!

85
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,381
Huh? Really?

86
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,581
Right! And when he turns the brim of his cap to the back,

87
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,081
it means switch off!

88
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,681
It's my turn, that is!

89
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,481
Before Mrs. Wakamatsu passed away,

90
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:56,335
she was looking at the design of these letters?

91
00:05:56,335 --> 00:06:00,339
Yeah. There seems to have been about 50 patterns all together,

92
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,341
and she seems to have been trying to choose

93
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,343
the good ones with Mr. Shiina and the others.

94
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,881
I'm sure that you've already know what went on after this.

95
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,681
While she was looking through them,

96
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,351
it seemed that her eyes got exhausted,

97
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,081
so it seems Mr. Fujinami gave her eye drops.

98
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,681
If I remember correctly, right after that,

99
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,981
the housekeeper brought tea that she newly made.

100
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,781
Soon afterwards, Inspector and I came in,

101
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,681
announced that we would be holding a voluntary on site investigation

102
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,181
and came to get you all.

103
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:28,981
But Mrs. Wakamatsu never once went near the baumkuchen,

104
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,781
so it was concluded that it would be okay for her to remain here.

105
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:34,373
Ms. Satake then asked her to sign

106
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:35,681
and stamp the contract while she was waiting.

107
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:39,481
And Mr. Shiina lent her his bronze fountain pen.

108
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:42,981
That's how things went, correct?

109
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,781
-Bronze? -Yeah.

110
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,481
It seems he received it from the president

111
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,581
in celebration for his 30th anniversary working at the company.

112
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,881
He also mentioned that

113
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:55,181
the other employers were given bronze wristwatches.

114
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,395
During the interrogation,

115
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,681
Mr. Fujinami and Ms. Satake were wearing something like that.

116
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,481
I think what they were wearing was the wristwatch they were given.

117
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,405
It's about time we leave!

118
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,081
We'll continue investigations again tomorrow!

119
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,681
Yes, sir!

120
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,881
Did that explanation suffice?

121
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,181
Yeah, couldn't ask for more!

122
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,417
I've figured out who the culprit is

123
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,681
as well as the trick with the explanation now, but...

124
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,681
There's no proof!

125
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:26,425
See, you later then.

126
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,481
We'll come back for another interrogation.

127
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,181
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,881
It's finally over. My throat is parched.

129
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:42,441
You haven't even taken a sip of tea, after all.

130
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,981
Then, would you like to have some Oolong tea that I bought

131
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,881
when I went to buy the soy sauce?

132
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,781
Poison couldn't possibly be inserted in a PET bottle, right?

133
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,081
No joke! It's already after 01:00?

134
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,481
Oh, no. I missed the last train?

135
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:09,181
Then, why don't you have Mr. Fujinami

136
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,481
drive you home together with me?

137
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:14,473
But she lives opposite from where your house is, doesn't she?

138
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,475
I guess so.

139
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,981
Would you like to spend the night at my apartment then?

140
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,479
It's pretty close from here.

141
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:22,481
All right.

142
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:26,485
It seems that we'll finally get a normal look at things.

143
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,281
Yeah.

144
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:32,981
Of the warped entity that we humans created from our own imagination

145
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:35,281
the proof of it!

146
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,581
Hey... Are you serious?

147
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:42,881
That you've figured out who killed that stupid son.

148
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,981
Yeah! We've figured out exactly

149
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:49,181
how that culprit made Ikuro eat the poison baumkuchen!

150
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:52,511
But, didn't the vice-president do it?

151
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:56,515
Right. The vice-president sprinkled poison powder

152
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,181
on the door knob of Ikuro's room,

153
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:00,781
and Ikuro ate the baumkuchen with his hand

154
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,981
that had poison on it, wasn't that the story?

155
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:06,981
Besides you also said that poison was detected

156
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,381
from the slippers that she was wearing, too!

157
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,531
The poison spilled on the slippers

158
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,533
when she sprinkled poison powder on the doorknob, right?

159
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,081
That was to throw us off!

160
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,981
Throw off?

161
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,181
Right.

162
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:21,181
It was a preparatory move to frame her.

163
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:25,581
This case was made to end when she killed herself.

164
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,881
Are you saying that Mrs. Wakamatsu cause of death

165
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,481
was homicide and not suicide, then?

166
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,549
Yeah.

167
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
I'm sure the culprit is one and the same person!

168
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,081
But, where do you have proof of this?

169
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:40,081
Ikuro washed his hands in the restroom

170
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,581
right before he picked up the baumkuchen!

171
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,081
Even if poison got on his hands before he left the room,

172
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:46,581
wouldn't it come off?

173
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:49,081
-Don't you think so? -Yep.

174
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,681
He wiped his hands using a handkerchief, too.

175
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:54,981
But it not an easy task to make Mrs. Wakamatsu

176
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:56,575
wear the slippers with poison on them, isn't it?

177
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,981
The restroom!

178
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:01,981
The slippers were switched while she was using the restroom!

179
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,583
The slippers that she was wearing were left outside the restroom

180
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,781
while she was in the toilet,

181
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:07,981
so they were switched with the ones with poison!

182
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,281
If so, how was the stupid son made

183
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:13,381
to pick up the poisoned baumkuchen?

184
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:17,381
If the poison wasn't on Ikuro's hands to begin with,

185
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:20,181
how else could...

186
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,601
That's easy!

187
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:26,381
It was placed so that Ikuro who is greedy when it comes to food

188
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,981
would naturally pick it up!

189
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,881
More so, if he was hungry!

190
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:33,881
Idiot! The pieces of baumkuchen then were cut

191
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,881
and divided into eight even pieces and were all exactly the same size!

192
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,281
Changing how you place the pieces

193
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,281
wouldn't have done much to change anything at all!

194
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:43,381
Then, you go and try it, Pops!

195
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:47,381
We placed two pieces on the tray just like the culprit,

196
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,629
so acting just as starved as Ikuro might've been!

197
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,631
Starved, come on...

198
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,281
What's this?

199
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,490
Hey, hold it!

200
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,490
It's obvious that the one on the other side is bigger!

201
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,490
Huh? True!

202
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,990
In this case, anyone who's hungry

203
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,090
would definitely pick the one up on the one farther beyond.

204
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,657
Like I said a while ago,

205
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,990
the size of the pieces of baumkuchen were exactly the same.

206
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,661
They're exactly the same.

207
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,090
We used the pieces of baumkuchen that you the police

208
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,990
used to carry out the voluntary on site investigation

209
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,090
a while ago, you know.

210
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,669
-What? -What?

211
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,190
Don't be ridiculous!

212
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,673
If you put one on top of the other, it's this big...

213
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,677
They're exactly the same size!

214
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,679
What's going on?

215
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,290
Jastrow effect!

216
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,890
When you compare the size of things,

217
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,290
people have a tendency to naturally compare

218
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,689
the length of the adjoining pieces nearest themselves!

219
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:55,190
So, if arched pieces like baumkuchen are placed in rows,

220
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,290
people tend to compare the short and long sides.

221
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,790
Therefore, although the pieces are all the same size,

222
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,290
people are deceived by the optical illusion

223
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,290
that the ones beyond are bigger!

224
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,190
-Right, Heiji? -Yeah!

225
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,190
It's an optical illusion that a psychologist named Jastrow discovered

226
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,590
more than 100 years ago!

227
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,490
I see. So the culprit placed the poisoned piece

228
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,717
in a position where it would larger to make Ikuro pick it up!

229
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,719
But if this was done,

230
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,723
the housekeeper Ms. Yonehara and Secretary Ms. Satake

231
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,190
who cut and placed the pieces of baumkuchen on the plates

232
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,729
and the ones who were standing near the tray

233
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,731
that the pieces of baumkuchen were on...

234
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,090
Chief Designer Mr. Fujinami

235
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,090
and Managing Director Mr. Shiina, all four of them

236
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,490
could've secretly done it, no?

237
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,090
But only one among them

238
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,743
could've poisoned Mrs. Wakamatsu to death.

239
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,747
Let's go to the study where she was murdered then!

240
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,753
What the heck's going on?

241
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,755
I thought that unraveling the mystery was going to begin

242
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,090
and yet we're suddenly shown something like this.

243
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,390
Watch closely!

244
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,290
Because there are at least 50 patterns.

245
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,090
Mrs. Wakamatsu was watching this with all of you

246
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,490
before she died, wasn't she?

247
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,767
Yes.

248
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,090
Huh? Are you tired?

249
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,390
Of course!

250
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,773
Having to watch all these flashing images one after the other...

251
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,775
Okay, then.

252
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:19,590
Can you write the kanji "waka" that is included in Mrs. Wakamatsu's name?

253
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,790
Huh? Such a simple kanji character...

254
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,790
Huh?

255
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,590
Let's see...

256
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,490
I think it was...

257
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,795
No cheating!

258
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,390
Mrs. Wakamatsu wasn't used to this computer

259
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,490
and probably couldn't open this file.

260
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,090
Hey, Takagi. The kanji character "waka"

261
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,290
what was written below the radical "grass"?

262
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,590
Don't you know?

263
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,790
You were looking at it repeatedly many times until a while ago.

264
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,590
Because he watched it repeatedly,

265
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,490
he's experiencing Gestaltzerfall!

266
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,490
-Gestaltzerfall? -Yeah!

267
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,819
There are times when a soil on the wall or the shape of a cloud

268
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,490
looks like the face of someone, aren't there?

269
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,290
That's because the face neuron inside your brain reacts

270
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,690
and mistakenly recognizes the shapes as faces!

271
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,290
There's a thing called the kanji neuron

272
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,833
that resembles the face neuron in the brain, too.

273
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,190
If you keep looking at the same kanji repeatedly many times,

274
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,839
it's said that the kanji neuron gets tired

275
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,390
and starts to malfunction!

276
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,990
In other words, even if it's a word that you know really well,

277
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,590
you start wondering was this the way it was written?

278
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,490
And lose track of what once you could do.

279
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,690
This is called Gestaltzerfall!

280
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,849
I get it.

281
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,853
The culprit repeatedly showed "Wakkodo no Sake" to Mrs. Wakamatsu.

282
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,390
And after she experienced Gestaltzerfall,

283
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,490
asked her to sign the contract!

284
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,190
She would've had to sign it "Serika Wakamatsu".

285
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,990
And the vice-president not being able to remember

286
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,890
how to write the character "waka",

287
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,869
took the Japanese dictionary that was on the bookshelf

288
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,890
and touched the "wa" page that was laced with poison,

289
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,875
thus, she ended up licking the poison.

290
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,990
Yeah.

291
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,590
"Waka" is one of the kanji characters

292
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,190
that easily causes Gestaltzerfall.

293
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,883
It seems that Mrs. Wakamatsu had a habit of licking her thumb

294
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,890
when flipping the pages, too.

295
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,887
Which means that the one who thought up this trick,

296
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,190
-and committed the crime is... -Yeah.

297
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,390
The person who showed the kanji character "waka" to her repeatedly

298
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,490
and asked her to sign the contract, too.

299
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,290
Ms. Satake, her secretary!

300
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,790
What?

301
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,490
You're the only one who could've carried out this crime!

302
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,490
Ms. Satake really did it?

303
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,390
I can't believe it.

304
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,090
But...

305
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,090
Could it be that all the disadvantageous evidence

306
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,290
pointed at Ms. Satake?

307
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,390
The fact that Ikuro was hungry

308
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,921
was really because I had coincidentally run out of soy sauce.

309
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,290
I don't think it was a coincidence.

310
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,927
When Mrs. Wakamatsu asked you to serve tea once again,

311
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,190
you asked her what brand she would like you to serve?

312
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,935
You knew where in the kitchen is what in this, right?

313
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,939
If so, I guess it would've been possible for you

314
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,390
to secretly get rid of the soy sauce, no?

315
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,590
Well, since you're the secretary,

316
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,390
you would've known that by the time Ikuro got hungry

317
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,590
the managing director as well as we would get here.

318
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,590
It's a usual thing that the managing director

319
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,490
would buy baumkuchen before coming.

320
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,490
On top of that, if you knew the number of guests you'd be having,

321
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,959
it would've been easy for you to cut it into eight pieces.

322
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,961
You're the one who said to cut the baumkuchen

323
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,390
into eight pieces too, right?

324
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,090
You said because it'd be difficult to cut into six or seven pieces.

325
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,190
Then you pretended to place the cut pieces of baumkuchen onto the plates

326
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,690
and sprinkled poison onto one of the two pieces.

327
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,690
Then, when did she lace the door knob and slippers with poison?

328
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,090
Before we came, I guess.

329
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,090
When we came, Ms. Satake was already in the house,

330
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,490
so I think she had made preparations

331
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,690
to kill Mrs. Wakamatsu in the study to by then.

332
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,890
But I'm the one who recommended that the vice-president

333
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,690
should stay back in the study because she looked tired.

334
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,997
If you didn't say it,

335
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,290
Ms. Satake would've suggested it anyway.

336
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,003
After that...

337
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,590
If it's an official on site investigation,

338
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,790
you need a warrant issued from court on hand

339
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,390
before starting the investigation

340
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,290
and be able to show it at the scene.

341
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,990
They would have to make us understand

342
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,015
the contents of the warrant, too.

343
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:21,019
She said this deliberately to lead us to the fake poison

344
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,890
on the door knob of Ikuro's room to throw us off!

345
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,025
You're also the one who called me over to the house in Osaka

346
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,027
after getting me interested in the optical illusion and worked it out

347
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,090
so that I would come to this house too, right?

348
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,290
The phrase, a warped entity

349
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,290
that humans created of their own imagination

350
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,290
that cannot be seen normally, also refers to optical illusion, right?

351
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,690
There are people that played the role

352
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,090
of misleads in this trick!

353
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,045
There were the two that used optical illusion

354
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,590
to deceive everyone from the fact that they killed the president,

355
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,390
so as in an eye for an eye,

356
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,190
the two were killed by using optical illusion!

357
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,790
It's true that it would be a trick

358
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,790
you'd like to use in a detective novel,

359
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,059
but circumstantial evidence is all there is!

360
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,590
Where do you have the concrete evidence to support your deduction?

361
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,090
Huh?

362
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,190
Your wristwatch, secretary...

363
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,990
It's glossy here and there. Why?

364
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,890
Well, this is...

365
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,290
That's the immovable concrete evidence!

366
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,390
Most probably when you sprinkled poison powder

367
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,090
onto the Japanese dictionary,

368
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,990
the poison powder spilled on to your left hand

369
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,890
that you were holding the dictionary with too.

370
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,990
Back then the hydrogen cyanide poison

371
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,087
that got caught in between the space of your bronze wristwatch...

372
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,089
most probably went through redox, washing the rust off

373
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,490
when you went to the restroom

374
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,490
and washed your hands or something.

375
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,390
You noticed this only back when

376
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,890
you remarked that you'd miss the last train.

377
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,490
It's about time for the last train.

378
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,290
You were looking at your wristwatch then.

379
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,390
That's why you held the PET bottle

380
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,790
in a strange way, back then, right?

381
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,190
It's understandable if Mr. Fujinami who switched the bottle

382
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,890
he was holding in his hand

383
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,790
in order to look at his wristwatch did so...

384
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,690
Normally, you wouldn't hold the PET bottle

385
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,090
in the same hand you take off the lid with.

386
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,990
I see.

387
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,590
So that's when you realized I was using only my right hand.

388
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,390
If I use my left hand, my sleeve would flip over

389
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,890
and the wristwatch would come into view.

390
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,990
But, how ironic that

391
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,790
this wristwatch I received from my father would give me away.

392
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,143
Father...

393
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,145
Are you the president's daughter?

394
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,690
Yes.

395
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,690
I'm the daughter from my father's first marriage.

396
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,790
I actually entered this company wanting to run it into bankruptcy

397
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,155
because he abandoned my mother.

398
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,590
But after I found out that he was just a workaholic, poor soul,

399
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,161
that wasn't good at expressing love...

400
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,890
I went out for wool and came home shorn.

401
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,167
Moreover, he knew that I was his daughter to begin with.

402
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,490
The fact was that he was planning to announce to everyone

403
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,173
that I was his daughter at his villa in Karuizawa.

404
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,390
What?

405
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,490
I heard so from the president, too.

406
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,190
But, just before that, my father was killed by Ikuro.

407
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,190
And then the vice-president hid the evidence.

408
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,490
I don't know why my father was killed.

409
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,190
Before the time I started to understand him,

410
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,990
I hated him quite a bit, too.

411
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,890
Then, you read the contents of the letter, didn't you?

412
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,197
Yes.

413
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:23,201
Yet, the vice-president said nothing after that so.

414
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,790
Maybe she gave it to me hoping

415
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,990
that I would kill Ikuro.

416
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,890
It was my mistake that I called Mr. Hattori over.

417
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,213
I meant to mislead him,

418
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:38,490
but he was way over me.

419
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,990
Or rather, should I say, "they".

420
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,290
Well, it was a crime using the trick of optical illusion,

421
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,790
so I guess the deceitful oft into the snares of deceit

422
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,229
is exactly what this is.

423
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,690
She's pretty good with words.

424
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,237
Heiji turned the brim of his cap behind!

425
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,890
It's your chance! Chance time!

426
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,590
I think I shouldn't, not today, don't you think?

427
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,790
Heiji's tired from using his head on the case, too.

428
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,253
I'm going to borrow Conan for a while, okay?

429
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,255
Kazuha! Give it all you got!

430
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,263
What is it?

431
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,590
I was planning to have a battle with Shinichi

432
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,990
about what he thought about the case from now and then.

433
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,790
Can't you tell?

434
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,990
They went off

435
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,290
so that we could have time to ourselves, just the two of us.

436
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,190
Huh?

437
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,090
Maybe you've already heard about this from Shinichi,

438
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,290
but it seems that he confessed

439
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,590
how he felt towards Ran in London.

440
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,590
And that's not why I'm about to say what I'm going to say,

441
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,289
but the thing is...

442
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,790
The thing is I...

443
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,990
from way before...

444
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,590
really...

445
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,990
I like you a whole lot!

446
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,490
He's gone? Heiji?

447
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,390
He ran off in the middle of the conversation!

448
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,790
About where?

449
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,990
By the part you said, "The thing is..."

450
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,290
What?

451
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,590
Hey, Shinichi!

452
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,407
Don't you have anything you need to tell your best friend here about?

453
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,890
-No, I don't. -Just tell me, I bet you have!

454
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,411
They are really get along, don't you think?

455
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,790
So jealous of Conan.

456
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,415
Don't hide it.

457
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,690
I said, there's nothing.

458
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

459
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,000
"Glasses lens"
