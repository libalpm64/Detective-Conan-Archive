1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,390
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,490
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,390
The star of the show today is Genta.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,190
Like you know he's not all that reliable, so let's all help him out.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,790
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,950
"Teitan Elementary School" -Dig in...

9
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,150
Listen, everybody!

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,950
Don't be picky and chew well when you eat!

11
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,750
Yes, madam...

12
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,050
Gosh.

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,750
I tell you, eating from a lunch plate in high school.

14
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,650
I feel like crying.

15
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,950
Oh, I sort of like this.

16
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,150
When I was in the States, I used to eat alone in the cafeteria.

17
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,050
That's why eating together with everybody like this

18
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,650
is interesting and very enjoyable.

19
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,450
Well, I felt nostalgic the first few time, too.

20
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,450
Oh, Mitsuhiko, you're not eating your carrots again.

21
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,950
Oh, I'm going to eat them all together at once later.

22
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,650
There are guys like him who push the food they don't like aside.

23
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,450
And, they are those who brag about how fast they can eat, too.

24
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,750
Well, in this class, the guy who just can't help but do so is...

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,850
I did it, I'm number one!

26
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,750
I was sure it was going to be Genta.

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,650
Ms. Kobayashi,

28
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,250
I don't feel well, so may I go to the infirmary and rest a while?

29
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,550
"Genta's Misfortune"

30
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,650
We've got a case here.

31
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,950
Genta has virtually not touched his food at all.

32
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,750
I wonder if he's on a diet?

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,750
No way, he's too fond of eating.

34
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,150
Come to think of it,

35
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,050
Genta hasn't been playing with us the past 2 to 3 days, has he?

36
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,650
Even after school, he'd go home ahead of us, all by himself.

37
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,550
Maybe he's being bullied by the seniors.

38
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,650
Don't be ridiculous, Genta's not the type to be bullied,

39
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,850
and even if he were, it would be safer for him

40
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,550
to go home with us, wouldn't it?

41
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,150
Maybe he's got problems at home.

42
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,350
Huh?

43
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,550
Maybe somebody in his family is seriously ill

44
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,850
or maybe they are having all-out quarrels every day.

45
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,050
If that's the case though,

46
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,750
it's not something that we can do anything about.

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,550
Oh, no.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,550
No such thing is happening.

49
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,050
Ms. Kobayashi.

50
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,950
His parents are healthy and well, managing a liquor store.

51
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,050
I went to visit Genta's house yesterday because I was worried, too.

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,050
But it is true he is afraid of something.

53
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,450
They told me that he would pull the covers over himself

54
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,250
as soon as he got home and tremble.

55
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,450
But, what is he afraid of anyway?

56
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,550
Well, no matter how many times I ask him, he won't tell me.

57
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,650
He keeps saying it's nothing.

58
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,450
Maybe he'll tell you people.

59
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,350
When you find out what it is, will you please tell me about it, too?

60
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,250
Okay.

61
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,550
Wait, Genta!

62
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,750
What are you sneaking around for?

63
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,850
Are you training to become a ninja or something?

64
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,950
I see!

65
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,450
You're on a diet, that's why you didn't eat lunch,

66
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,650
so that you could get into shape.

67
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,350
Right.

68
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,550
I saw a real cool Ninja movie the other day so...

69
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,750
Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,650
Why would a person like that be trembling under covers?

71
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,250
I'll bet you dreamt that you were being slashed

72
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,350
by some blood smeared samurai warrior,

73
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,450
and running around from an illusionary enemy of some sort.

74
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,550
Dream, no way! I really...

75
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,850
You really?

76
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,050
You really what?

77
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,750
To tell the truth, I...

78
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,550
My life is being sought after by a killer!

79
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,750
Killer?

80
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,850
Stop joking, Genta.

81
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,650
There's no way that a killer would come after a grade school student!

82
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,650
She's right.

83
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,850
After all, he's not me nor you.

84
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,050
Hey.

85
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,350
I was stupid to have told you guys about it.

86
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,950
Hey, wait.

87
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,350
Genta, please tell us more in detail about it!

88
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,950
I won't laugh at you anymore.

89
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
I heard strange footsteps

90
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,050
when I was walking along the road under the railroad track.

91
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,650
It was pitch dark that I couldn't see the guy,

92
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,150
but when I stopped he stopped and when l ran he ran.

93
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,550
It was most likely your own footsteps echoing off the wall of the road.

94
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,250
That's not all!

95
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,750
I was pushed off the stairs of the pedestrian crossing,

96
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,850
and even last night, a motorbike ran a traffic light

97
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,150
and came right for me.

98
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,350
It was probably only a coincidence, mere coincidence.

99
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,850
It was no coincidence!

100
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,550
Because that guy...

101
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,550
The guy...

102
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,050
What a large screw.

103
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,850
It's dangerous.

104
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,950
I wonder where it came falling from?

105
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,550
The neon sign of the department store.

106
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,350
I'm sure the bolt was old and it fell off coincidentally.

107
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,350
This is just a bad day, a merely bad day!

108
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,750
Genta, maybe you'd better go get exorcised.

109
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,750
No. It's neither a bad day nor a coincidence.

110
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,250
Look,

111
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,450
there are traces of the wiring having been cut by a knife.

112
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,850
It was cut beforehand,

113
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,350
so that when the bolt is loosened

114
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,650
and the neon sign falls it doesn't get stuck.

115
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,450
If so, it would fall indiscriminately on anyone

116
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,050
who walks below the sign.

117
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,450
It seems that the target was set.

118
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,150
Take a look at this.

119
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,850
Isn't this the Kamen Yaiba toy that Genta is always looking at?

120
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,850
Which means that...

121
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,050
Yeah. It seems that just as Genta says,

122
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,650
somebody is after his life.

123
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,650
There seems to be no doubt about it.

124
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,650
Genta, tell me more in detail about this.

125
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,650
About why you're being targeted.

126
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,850
Okay.

127
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,550
What?

128
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,450
You saw a serial purse snatcher?

129
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,550
You mean you saw that purse snatcher who's been attacking

130
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,450
only aged people and women In this area recently?

131
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,550
Yeah.

132
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,550
He looked just like the wanted poster composite drawing

133
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,250
at the police station.

134
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,050
Did you tell the police?

135
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,950
Yeah, about a week later.

136
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,950
Because when I first saw him

137
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,450
there was no composite drawing posted.

138
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,750
I remembered that I saw the purse snatcher

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,150
after I saw the wanted poster,

140
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,150
but I forgot where I saw him.

141
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,700
But, I found the young man

142
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,900
who saw the purse snatcher together with me.

143
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,000
Saw him together with you?

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
Yeah. About 5 days ago,

145
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,400
there was a purse-snatching incident near my house,

146
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
so I went to look.

147
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Then, I found the blonde guy who was standing beside me

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
when the purse snatching incident happened among the onlookers.

149
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
And, what happened after that?

150
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,100
Of course, I took that young man to the police that was over there!

151
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,900
But that young man said, I don't know the boy nor the purse snatcher.

152
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,300
Are you sure you saw the purse snatcher together with that man?

153
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Yeah. When I saw the purse snatcher,

154
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,400
it seemed that man was sitting next to me.

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,000
So I was sure that he saw him, too.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
What do you mean by it seemed?

157
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,100
I was sort of sleepy then,

158
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,900
so I just happened to notice that the man was beside me.

159
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
What about the purse snatcher, then?

160
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,700
He may have been around and he may have not.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,600
People usually get sleepy,

162
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,300
when they are in a movie theater.

163
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,500
Or in a train.

164
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,400
Judging from what Genta is saying,

165
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,300
it seems that the purse snatcher is after him.

166
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,400
Gosh.

167
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,400
And why didn't you tell the police that somebody was after your life?

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,700
I got a phone call.

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,100
I'll kill you if you tell anybody about me!

170
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
I'll kill your friends family and everybody around you", he said.

171
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,600
That's why you didn't say anything till now.

172
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,900
Yeah.

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,600
But, we do have a problem.

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,700
If he has your phone number, he probably knows your address, too.

175
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,800
Yeah.

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,900
If we rush over to the police,

177
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,700
the culprit may mistakenly think that Genta recalled something,

178
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
and God knows what the culprit will do.

179
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,200
He could be watching us here in this shop right this minute.

180
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,300
And, don't you remember anything else

181
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,900
that could serve as a clue to finding the culprit?

182
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,700
I told the police officer too,

183
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,300
but he was smoking a cigarette with his left hand.

184
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,100
Which means that the culprit is left-handed!

185
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,400
He was wearing a strange looking T-shirt.

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,000
A black T-shirt with a white skeleton on it.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,700
Like that. Like that.

188
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,200
He was wearing the same T-shirt as that one!

189
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,300
Excuse me, sir.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,200
Are you the man who is after Genta's life?

191
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
His face is totally different.

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
What do you guys want with me?

193
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Besides the T-shirt of the man I saw had 202 on it, not 1999!

194
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,500
Do you remember where you bought that T-shirt?

195
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
A clothes store in front of the station called Bones.

196
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,800
Thank you, sir.

197
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Okay.

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Okay, let's go check out that shop then.

199
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes, that skeleton T-shirt is...

200
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,300
an original item of ours!

201
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,600
But, I wonder if we had anything that said 202.

202
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,900
What other kinds of T-shirts did you have?

203
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,400
1999, HELP, ESCAPE, all with some kind of pleading message.

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Remember in the year 1999,

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,700
people made a fuss because of that prophecy, right?

206
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,200
We pushed our luck and started making those T-shirts.

207
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
Did you notice anyone suspicious

208
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,700
among the people who bought that T-shirt?

209
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,900
I wonder.

210
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,400
It was quite some time ago,

211
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,200
so l don't remember the faces of the customers.

212
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,450
Found nothing.

213
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,950
If you could only remember where you saw the culprit, Genta.

214
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,850
Wasn't it in a movie theater or on the train?

215
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,250
No, because smoking is not allowed in those places.

216
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,550
What about a family restaurant, then?

217
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,850
I'm sure that's it.

218
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,950
You probably were full and got sleepy.

219
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,150
But that guy wasn't eating anything.

220
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,250
I was staring at him for a while,

221
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,750
but all he did was glare at the newspaper and smoke cigarettes.

222
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,150
How come you can remember all that

223
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,850
and still cannot remember where you saw him?

224
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,550
I don't know why.

225
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,950
But, how strange.

226
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,950
If you stare at someone like that, it's most likely to get scolded.

227
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,050
Did you get scolded?

228
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,450
3 Nope. Besides, my eyes never met his.

229
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,150
I see. So, that's what it was.

230
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,950
The 202 skeleton shirt.

231
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,250
Left handed.

232
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,450
And a place where you don't get scolded

233
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,050
for staring at somebody for a long time.

234
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,250
Genta, I've figured it out.

235
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,450
The place where you witnessed the culprit.

236
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,210
Hey, Genta.

237
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,710
It was at a glasses shop, right?

238
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,710
The place where you saw the purse snatcher.

239
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,610
You said that you didn't get scolded

240
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,710
even when you kept on staring at him, right?

241
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,210
Yeah...

242
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,810
If the culprit had taken off his glasses to have his glasses cleaned,

243
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,510
he wouldn't be able to tell If somebody were looking at him

244
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,410
because everything would be blurred, right?

245
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,310
B.But, Conan, I never went to an eyeglasses shop.

246
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,810
You've gotta be kidding! Because look over there.

247
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,210
You're totally wrong!

248
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,710
Really? I thought I had it all figured out.

249
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,710
I guess that's it for the Holmes of this century then.

250
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,610
Well, well, it's only human to make mistakes.

251
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,710
Don't get depressed!

252
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,410
I'll see you all, then.

253
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,710
Let me know if you recall anything, okay?

254
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,810
Okay!

255
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,210
I wonder where it was that you saw the culprit, though, Genta.

256
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,210
A place where you don't get scolded for staring

257
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,410
and a place that makes you sleepy.

258
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,710
Maybe it's at school? Because Genta's always sleeping.

259
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,710
If such a person came to school, we would surely have seen him, too.

260
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,210
That's true.

261
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,510
Hey! Will you wait a sec? Right here.

262
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,710
My goodness.

263
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,910
You sure love to eat, don't you?

264
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,110
You're going to get fat.

265
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,610
Who cares? I can't help eating what I like.

266
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,610
You've got ice cream on your cheek, Genta.

267
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,010
What's the matter?

268
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,910
Did you remember something?

269
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,210
No, not really.

270
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,710
Please be careful on your way home, okay?

271
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,110
Bye!

272
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,610
Three skewers with green onions and chicken and 4 liver, please.

273
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,610
Okay!

274
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,310
I think I'm a little hungry.

275
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,410
But, you just ate ice cream a while ago!

276
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,810
It's French food!

277
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,610
Hey, hold your horses!

278
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,010
It's only a little way more to home.

279
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,110
Red, white and blue...

280
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,610
What about the French flag?

281
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,310
Hey, Ayumi, doesn't red, white and blue look familiar?

282
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,510
I wonder.

283
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,210
But, Conan is always wearing a red bow-tie,

284
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,710
a white shirt and a blue jacket.

285
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,610
Don't tell me that the purse snatcher you saw was...

286
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,610
Don't be silly. Conan would never do something like snatch purses.

287
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,610
I don't know why,

288
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,510
but the colors red, white and blue are spinning inside my head.

289
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,810
I'll see you around, Genta! Go straight home, okay?

290
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,810
Yeah.

291
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,310
If you get any fatter than you are now,

292
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,210
you'll be the laughingstock of the pigs.

293
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,510
Shut up!

294
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,310
Seriously, that girl, Ayumi.

295
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,910
All she can ever say is fatso, fatso.

296
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,910
I'm not all that fat.

297
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,510
I got it! It was over there!

298
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,910
The 7th floor of the station building,

299
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,910
in front of the elevator.

300
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,310
Hold the elevator!

301
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,810
Wait a sec!

302
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,310
What floor, sonny?

303
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,510
Seventh floor, please.

304
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,910
Hey, sonny!

305
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,310
The blonde man.

306
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,110
I'm sorry about last time.

307
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,710
It seemed to have slipped my mind.

308
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,910
I remember now.

309
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,010
The place where I saw the purse snatcher with you.

310
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,010
Don't talk so loud.

311
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,910
He may be looking from somewhere, right?

312
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,410
Don't tell me that he came after you, too?

313
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,010
Yeah, I just remembered a while ago, too.

314
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,210
I thought it'd be better to see if both our stories match

315
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,310
before we head off to the police.

316
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,710
Right, let's go to the men's room

317
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,210
where nobody will come around.

318
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,510
No doubt about it!

319
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,510
This guy.

320
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,110
What?

321
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,710
I'm sure he wrote the name "Shibata" on the customer's list.

322
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,310
Who are you?

323
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,010
If you get funny, you're really going to get it.

324
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,910
Left handed, with a 202 skeleton T-shirt.

325
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,810
With the testimony that Genta gave,

326
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,910
it's no surprise that the police couldn't make out who the culprit was.

327
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,710
Because Genta was watching your reflection in the mirror.

328
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,910
You guys are the kids 4 that were around a while ago.

329
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,210
Right.

330
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,410
Genta didn't get scolded for staring at you

331
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,910
because he was looking at your reflection through the mirror.

332
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,210
In other words, the 202 that was reflected in the mirror

333
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,510
was actually SOS.

334
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,310
You're not left-handed, but actually right-handed.

335
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,310
A place that Genta would go,

336
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,710
where there is a mirror,

337
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,510
and moreover, get you sleepy.

338
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,710
Where else would it be but a barber, right?

339
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,510
And, Genta mistakenly thought that he saw the culprit with you...

340
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,110
is because you dyed your hair blonde while he was asleep.

341
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,510
The man with glasses and black hair turns blonde.

342
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,910
Since your clothes were covered under the cloth

343
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,110
and you were seated next to Genta.

344
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,610
That's why he thought you were another person.

345
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,610
What is this kid talking about? And he doesn't even have proof.

346
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,410
A witness is standing right behind you.

347
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,310
The barber who dyed your hair.

348
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,610
You were lucky because he hates to watch TV.

349
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,110
And, there were no posters with composite drawings of you

350
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,410
along the road where he used to walk.

351
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,910
You may have thought that you could easily commit the next crime

352
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,210
by simply dyeing your hair back to black,

353
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,110
and that you'd never get caught.

354
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,010
But your fingerprints were left on the bag

355
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,910
that you previously attempted to snatch and failed.

356
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,310
If the fingerprints match your fingerprints,

357
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,810
now you have no way out, do you?

358
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,910
Then what?

359
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,110
You mean this kid was going all over town because...

360
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,410
I wanted to lure you over here.

361
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,310
The ice cream that was on his mouth was shaving foam

362
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,610
that you use when shaving your face.

363
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,210
The French flag that is red, white and blue

364
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,210
is the spinning pole of the barber.

365
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,710
And the reflection on the glass window was the mirror.

366
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,610
Everything ended up reminding him of a barber.

367
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,710
We had Genta pretend that he recalled the barber,

368
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,310
so that the blonde-haired man, you would follow him

369
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,910
and walk into our trap.

370
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,810
You've gotta be kidding!

371
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,510
What do you think you're doing you broad?

372
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,410
You're so dumb.

373
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,910
Do you really think I'd walk all over town

374
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,410
just to lure you out here?

375
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,910
What?

376
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,710
Right. While Genta

377
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,210
was making you run around town and buying time,

378
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,810
we called the cops, so you're surrounded.

379
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,710
Therefore, the purse snatcher was arrested.

380
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,710
The case was solved just like that.

381
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,810
Conan, you really gave it to that guy, didn't you?

382
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,810
Are you really a grade-schooler?

383
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,710
I just copied the police officer that I saw on a TV drama!

384
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,210
I see.

385
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,010
The Youth Detective Squad does it again!

386
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,210
Genta, I think you're sleeping a bit too much.

387
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,010
You were asleep all the time the man was getting his hair dyed blonde.

388
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,410
The barber told me that he didn't wake me

389
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,610
because I seem to be sleeping so soundly.

390
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,210
Well, but they do say, children who sleep well grow fast.

391
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,810
Aren't you glad that the culprit was not left-handed

392
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,110
and right-handed just like you assumed?

393
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,310
Well, I guess if it were them,

394
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,810
I guess they would've come after me, instead of Genta.

395
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,110
So, I guess it wasn't them.

396
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,010
Hey, don't tell me you're talking about...

397
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,910
If you didn't know, you'd better remember this well.

398
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,510
Gin is left-handed, too.

399
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,840
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,820
"Cell Phone"

401
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,680
In the next episode.

402
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,420
I, the renowned detective will...

403
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,460
You'll what?
