1
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,855
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:08,555
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,155
A secret-filled cell phone.

4
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:11,955
There are tricks everywhere in the mails as well as the conversations.

5
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:13,755
An entangled baffling case!

6
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,255
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:16,955
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,455
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:02,723
I know that I shouldn't send this.

10
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,523
Maybe I should just take my time and see what happens?

11
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:08,423
I know I may have a chance to come in touch with their boss eventually.

12
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:12,323
That chance will come. I'm sure.

13
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,223
Conan!

14
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:17,423
You're still in your pyjamas.

15
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:20,923
I told you to hurry and get changed because we're going out, didn't I?

16
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:24,923
Come on, never mind the cell phone.

17
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,323
Okay.

18
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:30,223
Gosh.

19
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:31,723
Oh, right.

20
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:34,923
I guess I'll send Shinichi a mail before going out.

21
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:38,523
Because he may show up out of the blue while we're out.

22
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:41,923
We're going to accompany Dad today to cover a case.

23
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:47,323
If it turns out to be a tough one, I may be asking you for advice.

24
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,123
Conan's cell phone is ringing.

25
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,923
He just got mail.

26
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:02,523
Don't tell me it's the mail I just sent?

27
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:07,523
It can't be because I sent mine to Shinichi's address.

28
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:11,223
But the timing is too good for it to be a coincidence.

29
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:18,723
"Request from a Queer Family (Part 1)"

30
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,423
Did you look at the contents?

31
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,123
No, I didn't.

32
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,423
It sounded like you got incoming mail,

33
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:33,923
so I just wondered who it was from.

34
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,223
I'm sure it's from Doc!

35
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,023
Just as I thought.

36
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:40,523
He's repairing the Youth Detective Squad badge. I asked him to do so.

37
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,523
It's from Ran!

38
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,923
Then, don't tell me...

39
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,223
Don't tell me that...

40
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:48,923
Oh, no.

41
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,223
Give me a break.

42
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:59,123
Do you guys have to tag along like this each and every time?

43
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:02,723
But your client requested that you come along with family, right?

44
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:07,423
Besides, we may come up with some idea that may help you out again, too.

45
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:09,223
Right, Ran?

46
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,823
True.

47
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,223
With a fantastic deduction that is just as good as some great detective

48
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,223
that is usually God knows where.

49
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,923
Going all out like that.

50
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,423
There's something fishy about that mail that you got a while ago.

51
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,323
He's probably taking measures so that the mails that I sent him

52
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:27,923
won't be seen by someone he doesn't want them to be seen by.

53
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,923
He told me that he couldn't give me his phone number because he's busy

54
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:32,323
and can't answer the phone,

55
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:35,123
but he gave it to Conan after all.

56
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:38,623
If he had been contacting Conan all the time,

57
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,423
Conan's fantastic deductions

58
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:43,623
and for some strange reason, knowing things about me,

59
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,723
all fall into place.

60
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:49,323
That Shinichi is taking advantage of a child.

61
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,823
I'll never forgive him.

62
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,323
Cell phone?

63
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,623
Yes, I'd like you to find it for me.

64
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:02,723
If possible, by today.

65
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:05,823
If not, I may end up

66
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:08,223
"Tomoko Kariya (39)" -not being able to stay here anymore.

67
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,623
Why would that be?

68
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:12,623
Well, the thing is...

69
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,623
What?

70
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,923
You'll be getting a mail from your lover tonight?

71
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,723
You're the one who needs to hush up.

72
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,523
I'm worried that the mail may be seen by my jealous husband,

73
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:31,123
my strait-laced father-in-law or talkative younger brothers.

74
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,323
Then why don't you contact your partner immediately

75
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:36,623
and tell him not to send you mail?

76
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:41,123
Well, he's the one who calls me from his side all the time,

77
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,623
and his number is an unlisted number.

78
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:45,523
He always sends me mail over the weekends,

79
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:48,923
but he rarely looks at the mails that I send him from my side.

80
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:52,223
I have no way of contacting him from my side.

81
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,023
He sounds pretty selfish.

82
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,923
But there are egotistical people like that around.

83
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,823
Right, Conan?

84
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,523
Really?

85
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:05,423
And where and when did you lose it?

86
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,023
I don't know.

87
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,823
I just realized it two days ago.

88
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:13,723
But I'm pretty sure that someone in this house has it.

89
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,323
What do you mean?

90
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:19,323
I called my cell phone as soon as I lost it.

91
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:23,123
After about 10 rings or so, somebody answered the phone

92
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:26,323
but said nothing and hung up right away.

93
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:29,623
But I heard it on the other side of the line,

94
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,323
the sound of my father-in-law blowing his unskilled bamboo flute.

95
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,523
Listen to this.

96
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,923
He sure sounds terrible.

97
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:43,123
Moreover, he only plays the flute in his room.

98
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,623
So the fact that this sound was heard on the phone

99
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:49,023
means that the cell phone is somewhere in this house.

100
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:52,723
But no matter how many times I called after that, I get no answer.

101
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:55,823
Then why not get everyone in the house together and...

102
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:58,323
Yes. Of course I already asked everyone.

103
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,423
But they've all told me that they don't know.

104
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm sure that they're waiting for me to goof.

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,123
Somebody probably doesn't like me and wants to chase me out of this house.

106
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:10,223
If divorce comes up, God knows how much alimony will be demanded of me.

107
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,523
Why don't you call the phone company

108
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,823
and have them stops your phone service?

109
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:16,423
Even so, I wouldn't be able to erase the mails

110
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:19,023
that he had sent me from the memory.

111
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:22,023
I do have it locked just in case, so no one gets to look at them.

112
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:24,923
If I stop the phone, it would probably breed more suspicion

113
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,023
and the lock may be undone.

114
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,923
But how should I go about looking for it?

115
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:35,423
You're her friend from your junior high school days.

116
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,523
Yes, sir! I'm Mouri.

117
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,323
Rather, Goro Mori.

118
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:43,523
Mr. Mori will be building a house soon,

119
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:47,223
so he wanted to see this house that you designed for reference.

120
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:50,023
"Daisaku Kariya (68)" -Oh, I see.

121
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:53,623
Please help yourself and look around to your heart's content.

122
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:54,823
I see.

123
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:56,823
That's why she asked him to bring the family with him.

124
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,623
I'll let you listen to my flute.

125
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,623
I really don't think...

126
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:04,223
Can you tell if you hear your cell phone ring?

127
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:08,523
Yes, but it could be on manner mode.

128
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:09,523
Okay, ring it.

129
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,723
At this age,

130
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:26,923
you need to go to the restroom so often that it's a bother.

131
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:31,023
Excuse me for a moment.

132
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,323
Don't tell me that father...

133
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:36,023
I don't think so.

134
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:37,923
Because whoever answered the phone just now

135
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:39,823
hung up right away.

136
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:45,423
He sure doesn't look to be such a strait-laced person.

137
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:47,923
He looks that way, but he is actually a very scary man.

138
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:51,723
Even the incident that happened 12 years ago.

139
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,823
It was because of father to begin with.

140
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:57,023
12 years ago?

141
00:08:58,523 --> 00:08:59,623
Oh, well. Never mind.

142
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,923
Shall we look elsewhere then?

143
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:05,023
Your classmate?

144
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,323
You mean your ex-boyfriend or something?

145
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:09,923
Of course not.

146
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:14,423
So you write novels?

147
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,623
Yes.

148
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,723
I'm still an unknown writer.

149
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,723
But in three months,

150
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:23,723
you may be hearing my name whether you like it or not.

151
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,123
Shigehide Kariya.

152
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:27,623
You mean you're the one who writes those pure love novels?

153
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:31,423
So the rumour about your novel being aired on TV is true.

154
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:35,723
But I expected you to be much older.

155
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:39,523
Your novel's going to be dramatized. How wonderful.

156
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:42,123
Hey, Ran. Make the call.

157
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,023
Oh, it's from the publisher.

158
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,023
Yes, hello.

159
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,323
How about it?

160
00:09:57,323 --> 00:10:00,523
No, he isn't the one. Because that person hung up right away again.

161
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:03,623
Huh? A meeting?

162
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,323
I see.

163
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:08,123
I'll meet you at the family restaurant in front of the station then.

164
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:11,123
What timing though. A while ago and even now,

165
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,723
talk about a string of coincidences.

166
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:15,523
Right, coincidences happen a lot.

167
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,323
Things that seem to happen by chance are called coincidences

168
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,223
because they don't usually happen.

169
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,023
I guess you're right.

170
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:24,223
But Mrs. Kariya, if it's this type of investigation,

171
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,523
you may as well get yourself another cell phone and try calling yourself.

172
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,623
Are you saying that I go out and get myself another cell phone?

173
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:33,823
I don't have much money that I can use freely.

174
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:36,023
I decided to hire a professional

175
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,323
instead of relying on my friends to protect my privacy, too.

176
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:46,623
So your husband is an illustrator.

177
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:49,323
He doesn't seem to be around though.

178
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:53,623
If he's not around, this is our chance.

179
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:59,323
See. Coincidences don't keep on happening.

180
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:01,923
This picture sure looks familiar.

181
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,023
Oh, that's it.

182
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,523
The painting of Tsugutaka Kariya that was popular some time ago.

183
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:08,723
Oh, so you're familiar with my painting?

184
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,923
Just who are you all?

185
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:13,223
Dear, he is...

186
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,623
So you're Tsugutaka Kariya.

187
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,723
I expected you to be a lot younger.

188
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:22,523
I guess you could say the paintings of the young people are like e-mails

189
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,223
whereas my paintings are letters.

190
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,223
The depth of colour differs.

191
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,223
A guest?

192
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,523
Leave it be.

193
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:34,823
I'm sure it's the publisher

194
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:36,823
that's come to pressure me to hand in my work.

195
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:40,423
It's been ringing for quite a long time.

196
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:48,023
Wasn't it a guest?

197
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,623
Well, I went to answer the door but there was no one there.

198
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,823
Do things like this happen often?

199
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:55,723
Sometimes.

200
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:59,323
Mrs. Kariya says it's some child playing a prank.

201
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,123
What're we going to do?

202
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:03,123
There no place to look for it anymore.

203
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,423
Mr. Mouri, no need to worry.

204
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:08,223
As you can see, I've found my cell phone.

205
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:09,523
-Huh? -What?

206
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,923
Thank you very much.

207
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:14,223
I'll make sure I deposit the payment to you.

208
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:16,623
Talk about a stupid case.

209
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:20,623
Right. There are people deceiving people behind their back, too.

210
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,223
Talk about stupid.

211
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:27,123
May I stay over at Doc's house tonight?

212
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,923
You're going to play games again with Doc?

213
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:30,223
No, you can't.

214
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:34,123
Because I have a lot of things I want to talk over with you tonight, Conan.

215
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,823
Okay, then. Can we just stop by for a little while?

216
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,423
Because my badge is repaired.

217
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:42,823
Shinichi, what's up at this time of day?

218
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:47,723
Bummers, I'm in a fix.

219
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,423
It's seems that Ran called my cell phone.

220
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,423
Tonight at around 7:00,

221
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:53,823
a woman's body was found in a car parked along the Teimusu River.

222
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:57,723
The woman has been identified from her belongings

223
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:00,902
as Mrs. Tomoko Kariya, 32 years old, a housewife residing in Haidocho.

224
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,802
The police have concluded this to be a murder case.

225
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:05,802
There seems to be strange things found at the scene so...

226
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,302
What?

227
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:17,843
The victim is Mrs. Tomoko Kariya.

228
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:19,443
According to the medical examiner,

229
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:21,543
she was stabbed in the stomach

230
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:24,743
then later hit on the head with a blunt instrument.

231
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,543
She was stabbed then later assaulted?

232
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,543
Yes, sir. There's a possibility that there could be more than one culprit,

233
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,443
because it's unnatural to think that the culprit wound stab someone

234
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:34,343
then use another weapon to attack her again.

235
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:36,343
Wait a second.

236
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:39,843
I think there was similar case like this in the past.

237
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:44,743
Her bag and cash are nowhere in sight, so it may be a robber.

238
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:48,143
We can't be too sure, Officer Takagi.

239
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,843
Oh, Mr. Mouri?

240
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:52,943
Hey, hey. This is work for the police to handle.

241
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:56,043
I wish you passersby outsiders keep out of this.

242
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,043
No, no, Inspector.

243
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:00,743
I am no outsider to this case.

244
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:03,443
Actually, that woman asked me to do work for her.

245
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:08,243
What? Mrs. Kariya was having an extra-marital affair?

246
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,343
No way.

247
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:11,543
Unfortunately, it seems to have been so.

248
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,243
Then, did her partner killed her?

249
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:16,343
No, we don't know for sure yet.

250
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,643
Would you have any idea who it could've been?

251
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:19,943
Come to think of it,

252
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,943
a guy with a moustache accompanied by a child came around.

253
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:26,443
Right, I think his name was Goro Mori or something like that.

254
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,143
Goro Mori?

255
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,843
Well, that's...

256
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,143
It's him!

257
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,943
How dare you!

258
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,643
You've got me wrong.

259
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:41,623
Kogoro Mouri, that renown detective.

260
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:43,423
Yes, sir. When I came this afternoon,

261
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,023
I couldn't reveal my name because of certain reasons.

262
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:50,323
Does that mean that you already arrested the one who killed Tomoko?

263
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,823
No, not just yet.

264
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:56,523
Excuse me, but where were you last night at around 7:30 in the evening?

265
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,323
Me?

266
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:02,323
I was here all the while. Isn't it right, Mr. Nakamura?

267
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:03,323
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:06,723
He was blowing his flute from a little before 7:00 when everyone came,

269
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:09,323
all the way to about 8:00.

270
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:14,423
He stopped blowing for a little while around 7:30 when I served him dinner.

271
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:16,223
Did you actually see him then?

272
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,523
No. When he's blowing his flute,

273
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:20,123
I am told to leave his dinner outside his room

274
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,523
so that I won't interrupt him.

275
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:28,723
But maybe he smelled the aroma of curry outside the sliding paper door?

276
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:32,423
It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner.

277
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,523
Around 7:30?

278
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,123
I was here.

279
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:38,023
I came back after the meeting ended at 6:00,

280
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:40,723
and was confined in this room working right through.

281
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:43,923
I think the two over there can testify to that?

282
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,323
Is that right?

283
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,023
Yes, that's correct.

284
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:49,823
Ever since the lights of the room was turned on around 6:30,

285
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,323
Shigehide's silhouette was in view from the sliding paper door.

286
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:56,923
Even when I brought him his dinner.

287
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,423
Which means you didn't actually see him in person.

288
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:04,423
No, because I'm told not to enter when he is working.

289
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:08,623
Is it really true that Tomoko was killed?

290
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:11,623
Yes. That's why we're investigating the case.

291
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:15,123
Then hurry on with it and get going.

292
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:19,123
Since you all came and keep going back and forth the corridor,

293
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,923
I can't seem to concentrate on my work.

294
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,423
He talks like that even though someone was murdered?

295
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,223
Which means...

296
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,223
the only people left in this house that we haven't questioned yet

297
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,923
is Tomoko's husband.

298
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,223
Yes, sir.

299
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:34,423
Huh?

300
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:36,723
His dinner is still left outside.

301
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:40,823
Mr. Tsugutaka Kariya, please answer us!

302
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:42,023
What's up?

303
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:44,923
Well, he won't say anything.

304
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:47,423
You asked me if I have any idea about it.

305
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,423
I don't know anything so I can't possibly answer that question.

306
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:53,123
It wasn't me to usually talk to her anyway.

307
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:55,723
It seems that you haven't touched your dinner, too.

308
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,023
Are you feeling sick or something?

309
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:01,123
No, I was absorbed in work that I simply forgot.

310
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,323
When you brought dinner to him, did you talk to him?

311
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,223
No. Well...

312
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,023
But I'm sure he was in his room

313
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:11,823
because I could smell the sweet aroma of his pipe.

314
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,223
Okay. Now that you're done, get going already.

315
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:19,623
His wife's been killed and he's still going to work.

316
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,823
Those three have an alibi.

317
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:24,823
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:25,923
It would take 20 minutes

319
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:28,323
even if you went full speed from here to the murder site.

320
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,223
They couldn't have committed the crime.

321
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:34,223
Which makes the man she was having an affair with the most suspicious.

322
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,723
But we have no idea of who, or where he is.

323
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,623
Shall we try tracing him starting with Mrs. Kariya's friends?

324
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,723
Hello?

325
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:46,623
Yes, this is the Kariya residence.

326
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:51,323
There's a phone call for Mrs. Kariya.

327
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:54,623
Hey, hurry and put Tomoko on the line.

328
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:57,023
Tell her to answer my mail.

329
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:00,023
This is the police.

330
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:02,923
What is your relationship with Mrs. Tomoko Kariya?

331
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:06,623
Yes...

332
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,323
He's innocent.

333
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:10,423
Huh?

334
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,123
He seems to have been at a pub in Hokkaido.

335
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:18,023
He says he called in rage because she didn't answer his mails

336
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:21,823
nor answer her cell phone today.

337
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,323
Then he didn't know about the incident?

338
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,023
But, Inspector,

339
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,923
it only takes one or two hours to Hokkaido by plane,

340
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:31,023
so if he flies straight to Hokkaido after committing the crime...

341
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,923
No, there were several of his colleagues

342
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:37,123
who said that they began drinking about at 8:00.

343
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,323
So he couldn't have committed the crime.

344
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,123
If so, who could've killed her?

345
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:43,823
How strange though.

346
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,123
All three people eat their meals in a different room.

347
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,123
Yes.

348
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:53,823
But everyone used to eat together until 12 years ago.

349
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,423
12 years ago?

350
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:59,423
Yes. When the third son, Eisuke was here, everyone always ate together.

351
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,023
Right.

352
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,923
Eisuke?

353
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:05,023
Eisuke Kariya.

354
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:07,323
I get it! Now I remember.

355
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,123
It's that case that happened 12 years ago!

356
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:10,523
Inspector?

357
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:15,623
There was an incident 12 years ago that seemed very similar to this case.

358
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:21,023
The one who was killed was Eisuke's fiance, Ms. Motoka Aida.

359
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:25,223
Like Tomoko, she was stabbed then later struck to death.

360
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:29,723
Back then, Eisuke who had disappeared was also thought to be a suspect,

361
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:34,023
but a large amount of his blood was also found near the phone booth.

362
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,723
Moreover, after the incident,

363
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:39,123
all the cash from Eisuke's account had been withdrawn.

364
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:40,823
So we thought that Eisuke had been kidnapped

365
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:44,823
and killed after the money was taken from him.

366
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:49,723
The murder site was a lonely place and there were no witnesses.

367
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,623
Investigation was at a deadlock.

368
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,323
Come to think of it, there was a call from Eisuke's friend last night.

369
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,123
For Eisuke?

370
00:19:58,123 --> 00:20:00,523
-No. -For Mrs. Kariya.

371
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:05,623
Something about the caller, Eisuke and Tomoko

372
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:09,223
used to belong to the same drama club of the university they went to.

373
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:12,923
Back then, she seemed to be very annoyed.

374
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:16,723
I didn't call you. Cut out your stupid talk.

375
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:20,623
Something sure smells fishy.

376
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:23,923
Do you know the phone number of that person?

377
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,523
Is that so?

378
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:32,023
Okay, if something comes up I may get back to you. Thank you.

379
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:34,723
How was it?

380
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:38,223
He's innocent. He has a perfect alibi.

381
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:40,623
He seems to have received silent phone call last night,

382
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:41,723
so he checked the history of his incoming calls

383
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:44,523
and found that it was Tomoko's cell phone number.

384
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,623
He tried calling her back many times, but couldn't connect

385
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,123
so he decided to call her home phone.

386
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,723
Strange.

387
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:54,823
Mrs. Kariya's cell phone disappeared the night before yesterday

388
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,823
and it was supposed to have been locked.

389
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,923
Don't tell me that the person who had the cell phone

390
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:02,623
unlocked the phone and made the call?

391
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:05,623
If so, could that have been the motive of the culprit?

392
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:09,323
Several calls from her lover were found saved in her cell phone, too.

393
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,623
In other words, that person is the killer.

394
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:15,123
But you found her cell phone right away, didn't you?

395
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,223
No.

396
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:18,023
Mrs. Kariya is the one who found it

397
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,123
and I don't even know where she found it either.

398
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:22,023
I didn't bother asking her.

399
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:28,723
Okay, Conan. We got all the information we need.

400
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:31,023
You're going to call Shinichi, aren't you?

401
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,623
Go on and call him!

402
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,723
Right. Once you call him, that's it.

403
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:37,223
I'm taking that cell phone from you

404
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,423
and talk to him directly myself.

405
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,423
You can't possibly do something like that.

406
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:44,423
What can't you do?

407
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:48,423
Because to lock the cell phone, you need to enter four digits.

408
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:53,123
There are 10,000 possibilities from "0000" to "9999".

409
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:56,123
I couldn't possibly try all those numbers out.

410
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:59,023
Well, maybe if I were so bored and had nothing to do

411
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:02,423
and moreover, was an invisible man unseen by anybody, then maybe...

412
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,023
An invisible man?

413
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:07,523
It's true that if it were to take three seconds to try it once,

414
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:08,923
that would add up to 30,000 seconds.

415
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:10,123
8 hours.

416
00:22:10,123 --> 00:22:12,723
I'd give up at that point.

417
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:15,223
Which means the one who unlocked the phone would be someone

418
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:18,123
who can stay without being bothered by anyone for a long period of time.

419
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:22,523
In other words, the three who are usually confined to their rooms.

420
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,050
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,150
"The case of 12 years ago"

422
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,250
The ending theme is "June Bride".

423
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,550
It's our song, for sure!

424
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,050
-Officer Sato isn't here. -I know that!
