1
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:05,985
A project to protect children from crime?

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,987
Yes. Because recently

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,625
cases of children being kidnapped in the city are on the rise.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,625
But...

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,625
Why would you, Inspector Shiratori of the Metropolitan Police Department

6
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,995
come all this way?

7
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,225
Well...

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,025
I just happened to be in the neighbourhood investigating a case,

9
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:21,325
so I thought while I was at it, I may as well...

10
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:24,725
You suddenly had this urge to want to see Ms. Kobayashi too, didn't you?

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,005
Officer Chiba...

12
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:30,009
I just met him this morning when I handed him his lunch.

13
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,625
By the way, why'd you come with me?

14
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,013
Why not?

15
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,015
I'm a graduate of this school.

16
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:39,125
What? I'm also a graduate of this school,

17
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,525
but what year class were you?

18
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:44,023
I think I was here in the 20th year...

19
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:47,525
Then, you're two years younger than me.

20
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:49,325
Then, do you remember?

21
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:52,025
The cooking teacher, Skeleton Kunigami.

22
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:56,035
Yes. He's still here and the children fear him

23
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,825
calling him "Death" Teacher.

24
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,625
Come on. Shall we head back then?

25
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,043
But...

26
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,725
It's been a long time since I came here,

27
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:08,825
so would it be okay for me to take a walk

28
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,049
around the school building?

29
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,525
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,

30
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,725
you must be true to yourself.

31
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:17,325
An elementary school classmate.

32
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,725
Where will Officer Chiba's first love go?

33
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,425
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:23,325
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,425
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

36
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,171
"Video Letter of First Love"

37
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,379
"Year 1, Class B"

38
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,479
What?

39
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,679
Look for a crime prevention video?

40
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,779
Yes.

41
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:21,279
During lunch time the police brought me this leaflet.

42
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,979
So for tomorrow's ethics class,

43
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,879
I'm planning to show a crime prevention video

44
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,185
in the audio visual room.

45
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,379
But, why do we have to look for that video?

46
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,579
If you know that it's in the warehouse of the audio room

47
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,479
why not go look for it yourself?

48
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,679
Well, you see...

49
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:37,879
I have a teacher's meeting I have to go to right now.

50
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,079
Come to think of it,

51
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,379
we never saw the video of our chorus contest

52
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,679
before either, did we?

53
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,579
In other words,

54
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,679
you're not good at looking for things.

55
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,209
Exactly.

56
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,879
Because the number of video tapes in the warehouse is countless.

57
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,579
The words on the labels are practically faded too.

58
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,679
Many of the labels have been stuck on one on top of the other,

59
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,579
so it's hard to tell which is which.

60
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,979
So, she wants you,

61
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,279
who are good at looking for things find it for her, right?

62
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,229
I guess so.

63
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,233
"Audio Visual Room"

64
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,979
Talk about a lot...

65
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,679
Just like teacher said the words are almost faded

66
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:23,579
and there are labels pasted one on top of the other.

67
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,245
They're not organized by year,

68
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,247
so it's going to be really tough looking for it.

69
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:30,279
Let's forget about it, already.

70
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,879
We, The Youth Detective Squad members are cautious,

71
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,979
so we'll be fine not watching a crime prevention video.

72
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,479
It's not bad to be on your guard.

73
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,679
No matter how careful you try to be,

74
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,579
a guy that you don't know at all

75
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,479
who is after your life may secretly

76
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,267
be sitting right next to you.

77
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,079
Are you talking about Subaru or what?

78
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,271
If you don't like him so much,

79
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,979
maybe you should sleep over at the detective agency?

80
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,679
No way.

81
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:00,279
But, how are we going to look for the video?

82
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,579
If we play all the videos and check the contents,

83
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,979
I guess we'll eventually find it...

84
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,287
What? You mean everything here?

85
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,279
We don't have to do that.

86
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,291
Since teacher asked us to do it,

87
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,979
it means that she came to check it once,

88
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,079
but couldn't find it.

89
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,299
Although the words on the label are almost faded,

90
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,979
they are still legible.

91
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,303
It's also unthinkable that anyone would stick another label

92
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,079
onto the label of a video that is considered

93
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,307
important enough to one day use in class.

94
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
Then, why can't it be found?

95
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,779
In other words, that video is not a VHS type

96
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,379
that is lined out on the shelf

97
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,317
but one that is put away somewhere.

98
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,979
That is, it is most probably a BETA video tape.

99
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,325
See, found it. A crime prevention video.

100
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,579
The school chorus contest video is also here.

101
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,879
I see.

102
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,479
Ms. Kobayashi's homeroom teacher

103
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,779
used to use BETA videos.

104
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,879
What's this BETA thing about?

105
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,379
I heard that in the past there were VHS and BETA video tapes,

106
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,879
but BETA lost and disappeared from the market.

107
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,479
But, why did BETA lose?

108
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,347
Beats me...

109
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,349
maybe it wasn't as good performance wise?

110
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,379
-Not really. -What?

111
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:16,355
Back then BETA had better image as well as sound than VHS.

112
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,357
The size of the cassette was also smaller

113
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,179
and was really popular among the video freaks.

114
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:22,361
Officer Chiba?

115
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,365
Well, but the recording time was shorter than VHS,

116
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,879
so it lost in sales strategy I guess you could say.

117
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,679
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,879
I brought along a crime prevention project leaflet

119
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,179
and while I was at it

120
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,779
I thought that I'd browse around the school building.

121
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,779
I felt nostalgic because I'm a graduate of this school.

122
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,779
But, that doesn't explain why you were hiding here

123
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,385
in the audio visual room, does it?

124
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,679
Well, actually...

125
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,879
What?

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,779
You were looking for the answer

127
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,079
to a love letter you wrote 13 years ago?

128
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,179
Really?

129
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,379
Yeah. I was in the broadcast club.

130
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,779
One day, we broadcast a mini drama

131
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,379
that we recorded during lunch recess,

132
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,079
and it really caught on.

133
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,279
So, I suggested whether it's turned down or not,

134
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,409
next time we should record an actual take of a drama

135
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,079
and play it at the school drama club.

136
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,479
Then a girl classmate of the broadcast club was all for it

137
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,079
and all the other members also started to agree with her.

138
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,379
As a result, the special SFX drama was somehow completed.

139
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,425
So, I took it that she was also a SFX fan

140
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,427
and talked a lot about the subject with her,

141
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,429
but she didn't seem interested at all.

142
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,479
I asked her, "Do you really like SFX?"

143
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,437
What I like is not SFX but...

144
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:43,479
Don't make me say it, stupid.

145
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,445
She answered with blushed cheeks.

146
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,679
So, the next day, I impulsively wrote her a love letter.

147
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:52,451
But, maybe I just mistakenly thought so after all?

148
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,453
No, I think she really had feelings for you.

149
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,455
That's right.

150
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,879
She also liked you, Officer Chiba.

151
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
Really?

152
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,979
And? Why is the answer to that love letter

153
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,779
in the warehouse of this audio room?

154
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,879
Did you lose the answer for the love letter you received from her in here?

155
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,879
No...

156
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,679
She did send me her answer in the mail soon afterwards,

157
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,379
so I have it with me even now.

158
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,579
You mean she didn't give it directly to you?

159
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,479
She had to change schools all of a sudden,

160
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,679
and I gave her my love letter

161
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,579
on the day of her farewell party, that's why...

162
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,487
She sent you the answer from the place she moved to.

163
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:32,879
But, wasn't her answer written in that letter?

164
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,179
I thought so too

165
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,579
and my heart was pounding while I was reading it, but...

166
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:38,779
In the letter it said that

167
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,879
"It would be easy to write how I feel in this letter,

168
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,279
but it may not really hit you so...

169
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,507
I will save it once in the warehouse of the audio visual room.

170
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:54,513
So that my feelings are carved onto your heart," she wrote.

171
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:55,979
I see.

172
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:59,779
She hid that video somewhere in this warehouse

173
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,979
where only you would probably look, right?

174
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:02,979
Yeah.

175
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,179
After reading her letter I came here right away

176
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,979
and looked in every nook and cranny

177
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,879
but didn't find anything that looked like a letter.

178
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,531
Have you seen her since then?

179
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,279
I haven't seen her even once in 13 years.

180
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,279
She didn't come to the class reunion either.

181
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,779
Then, why are you looking for something like that now?

182
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,543
I got a call from her saying,

183
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:28,547
"I'm going to the class reunion next week but are you coming?"

184
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,179
I answered that I'm planning to go, then she asked me...

185
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,553
"Since it was so long ago, you may not remember,

186
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:37,779
but did you see the video with my answer?"

187
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,079
Video?

188
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,579
And? What did you answer?

189
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,979
I answered that I didn't see it.

190
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:47,879
Then, she mumbled, "Oh..." and hung up.

191
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,079
Officer Chiba, how cruel of you.

192
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,779
I couldn't help it, could I?

193
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,379
Because I really didn't see it.

194
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,079
But, please wait.

195
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,079
If she said video...

196
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,679
She may have made a video letter

197
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,179
and dubbed it onto one of the videos and left it for you?

198
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,979
Yeah, I thought so too, so I came here.

199
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:11,179
I didn't check the contents of the video back then either.

200
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,593
And? Did you find it, that video letter?

201
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,179
No. I tried looking through the videos that look to be it.

202
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,179
I would pick up by fast forwarding it but...

203
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:22,601
There're so many of them.

204
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:26,179
And you all happened to walk in while I was doing this.

205
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:28,379
Then, let's look for it together.

206
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,611
But, it's a tough job going through all those videos.

207
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,779
There's no need to look through them from beginning to end.

208
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,379
If I were to make such a video letter,

209
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,879
I would put it at the end of an originally recorded film,

210
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,979
so it would be hard to find.

211
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:48,627
I see! All we have to do is check the end of the video tapes.

212
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,379
This is really exhausting.

213
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,379
Not this one either.

214
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,641
How many more are there?

215
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,879
That's the last one.

216
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,179
What?

217
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:09,179
We didn't see the SFX drama that you made, did we?

218
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:13,279
Mr. Kunigami took that video away from me.

219
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,079
No way.

220
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:19,379
Come to think of it, the advisor for the broadcast club was Mr. Kunigami.

221
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,079
But, that's not a problem.

222
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,779
But that SFX drama is carved deeply

223
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,479
in my head as my memory with her.

224
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,671
You see!

225
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,279
Well, I've been thinking about it but...

226
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,979
Why were you opening the lid of the video tapes?

227
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,579
This is a habit of mine.

228
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,479
My older brother used to part-time at a rental video shop

229
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:48,687
and was told to check if the tape

230
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:52,691
was rewound to the beginning by opening here.

231
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,079
This became a habit of his

232
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,979
and he used to open the lid of the video tapes at home

233
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,379
after watching them too.

234
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,699
I thought it looked awesome, so I copied him,

235
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,079
and before I knew it that became a habit of mine too.

236
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,479
Since when did acquire that habit?

237
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:09,379
From when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade of elementary school, I think?

238
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,679
When did you take that SFX drama?

239
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,879
Summer of 6th grade.

240
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,179
After that she suddenly moved away.

241
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,721
Ai, get me a writing brush and water in a cup!

242
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:25,879
You guys pull out videos with labels

243
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,279
that are stuck one on top of the other.

244
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,727
What?

245
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:33,079
Mr. Kunigami was known from before for being mean and stingy from before.

246
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,733
So, I'm sure that he taped over the tapes

247
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,979
that he confiscated right away and erased the original.

248
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:41,879
Known from before? How do you know?

249
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,179
You're only in 1st grade.

250
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,745
Well, never mind that.

251
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,279
There are quite a lot, aren't they?

252
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,579
Are you going to check the contents of these again?

253
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,079
No.

254
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,079
If you run the writing brush dampened with water like this.

255
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,765
The words of the label that is pasted below emerges.

256
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:11,579
Bull's eye. This is the video you made, Officer Chiba.

257
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,879
But Masked Baiya?

258
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,296
This is just a copy of Masked Yaiba.

259
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,812
But, the video letter is in here, right?

260
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:23,712
No, if that girl knew of Officer Chiba's

261
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:25,712
habit of opening the video tape,

262
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,212
I'm sure that the message will be exposed

263
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,789
when he opens here...

264
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,793
Nothing's written?

265
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,212
No joke?

266
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:45,172
What's up, Conan? Nothing's written.

267
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,805
Strange.

268
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:50,572
I was almost really sure that the message would be written here.

269
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:54,072
I'm sure that the video letter is in this tape.

270
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:57,572
Yes. Let's try and play it.

271
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,821
There was nothing in it.

272
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:06,825
Maybe it was erased when something was taped over it.

273
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,827
I don't think so.

274
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,872
A little bit of the scene of the drama was left

275
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:13,472
even after the tape over,

276
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:16,472
nothing seemed to be inside after it.

277
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:19,572
Come to think of it, she appeared a little bit

278
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,972
during the final scene of the drama.

279
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,372
See, it's this girl!

280
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,849
Thank you, Masked Baiya!

281
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,972
Cute!

282
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:36,855
She is, isn't she? Her name was Naeko Miike

283
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,372
and she was really popular among the boys in class.

284
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:40,572
But...

285
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:41,572
Nothing...

286
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:44,072
To think that a girl who looks like an idol like this

287
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,372
would fall in love you, Officer Chiba.

288
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,472
Hey, hey...

289
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,672
Did she really like you?

290
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,272
Do you have any recollection

291
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,572
of having done something to make her like you?

292
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:57,472
The thing is, I have no such recollection.

293
00:14:57,472 --> 00:15:00,472
I did make her cry just once though.

294
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:01,672
Were you mean to her?

295
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:02,872
How dare you!

296
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,272
No, I wasn't mean or anything,

297
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,872
she just suddenly started crying.

298
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,472
If I remember correctly,

299
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,872
we went home a bit late

300
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:12,372
because of things that we had to do at the broadcast club.

301
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,272
When we got to the crosswalk, she suddenly started to cry.

302
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,672
You dumb-dumb! I hate you!

303
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:23,372
After saying so, she ran home.

304
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:26,905
It seems that she wanted to go home early that day.

305
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,472
Then maybe she wanted you to stop her with force.

306
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,672
And, kiss her or something?

307
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:31,772
What?

308
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:34,472
I would never do anything like that.

309
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:37,272
If so, you must've said something to her.

310
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:40,072
Don't you remember what you said back then?

311
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,372
Back then...

312
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,925
I chased her and fell

313
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,372
and deeply cut the palm of my hand.

314
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:54,172
I see. And she treated your wound for you.

315
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,372
No.

316
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,272
She ran off not knowing that I fell.

317
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,572
Is that so?

318
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:00,939
But...

319
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,941
the cut that I got back then

320
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,972
is still left like a carving here on the palm of my hand.

321
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,172
Carved?

322
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,472
Come to think of it, he mentioned that

323
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,951
it was also written in her letter.

324
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:17,572
"So that my feelings are carved onto your heart,"

325
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,372
Directly carve on means...

326
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:20,959
Somewhere on the body.

327
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,972
I see... That's what it was!

328
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,172
Conan, did you figure out?

329
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:33,772
You figured it out, didn't you?

330
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,572
Yeah, I figured out that...

331
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:38,172
Officer Chiba used to...

332
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:40,572
sweat a lot since he was a child!

333
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,572
What?

334
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:44,472
It's true that I sweat a lot.

335
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:46,072
Although I wasn't as bad Genta,

336
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,372
I was pretty hefty.

337
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,272
What's that got to do with anything?

338
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:52,991
When you open this lid,

339
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:56,772
you place your hand on this side video, right?

340
00:16:56,772 --> 00:17:00,672
That's where she wrote the message with a water-based pen.

341
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:01,972
She did so, because that way,

342
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,772
the words would rub off

343
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,572
on the sweaty hands of Officer Chiba.

344
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,372
Moreover, she wrote it in mirrored words

345
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,272
that you would be able to read it too.

346
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,272
See. On my hands that I used to open the lid,

347
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,272
there's red ink, isn't there? That's the proof.

348
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,672
I see.

349
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:20,472
Even if you write on the black side of the tape with red ink,

350
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,772
it would not be visible.

351
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,572
On top of that, it's written in a place that no one else would touch,

352
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:26,172
so she didn't have to worry about anybody else seeing it too.

353
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,672
But, it's already been 13 years, so I wonder if it's still legible?

354
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:33,031
Don't worry. You rip the paper up like this

355
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,033
and wet it with water.

356
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,172
You paste it on like so on the side of the video,

357
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,072
then peel it off.

358
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:43,872
The message put here 13 years ago is revived.

359
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:45,972
"I like you too"

360
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:52,172
I like you too, is written here!

361
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,972
You both liked each other!

362
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,472
Amazing!

363
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,972
When's the reunion that she's coming to?

364
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:00,172
Tonight.

365
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:02,572
Then, maybe you should go?

366
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:06,072
But, I wonder about telling her at this point that I got her message.

367
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:09,067
No! You should go!

368
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:12,672
Her feelings finally reached you after 13 years, you know?

369
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,073
Of course she'd be happy.

370
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,075
Ms. Kobayashi?

371
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:20,472
I'm sorry. I overheard you.

372
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:29,372
What I like is not SFX but...

373
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:32,472
Don't make me say it, stupid!

374
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:37,095
What? Ms. Miike's not here?

375
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,672
No, she says she came up with an urgent matter.

376
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:43,101
She seemed really happy saying that she finally got together

377
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,472
with the one she really cared for after hoping for so long.

378
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,105
She got together?

379
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,172
I wonder. Maybe she got married or something?

380
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,772
What should I tell the children?

381
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:07,125
No way, a parking violation.

382
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,672
I was planning to come back

383
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:10,472
and re-park the car as soon as I saw her.

384
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:13,131
But, I was plodding along from shock.

385
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,133
Excuse me...

386
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,137
Don't worry about it, I haven't sent the data yet.

387
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,872
You left the engine on so you

388
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,141
were planning to come back right away, weren't you?

389
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:24,272
Yes...

390
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:25,872
Besides, being a police detective

391
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:28,272
there are times you may have to inevitably park, so...

392
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:29,772
No.

393
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,149
No matter if you're an officer or not,

394
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,872
a parking violation is a violation.

395
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,772
You've got to do your job.

396
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:40,372
Well, it's not like I came for an investigation or anything besides.

397
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:43,161
Then, I'll go pay for the violation

398
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,572
so will you give me the violation ticket?

399
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:46,872
Yes, sir.

400
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,171
I tried to act cool,

401
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:56,972
but the charge for violation 15,000 yen sure isn't cheap.

402
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:01,172
But, I wonder how she knew I was a police detective?

403
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,472
What's the matter?

404
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:03,872
Did that guy who got the parking violation

405
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,572
give you trouble or something?

406
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,185
No...

407
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,187
By the way, is it really okay?

408
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,172
Not attending the reunion?

409
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:12,272
Yes.

410
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:15,193
I haven't gone to the reunion for some time now,

411
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:18,672
so I think I'd feel uncomfortable even if I went anyway.

412
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:19,872
And...

413
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:23,672
I got to see the person that I really wanted see too.

414
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:29,207
Well, it seems that he had forgotten all about me though.

415
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,872
Are you talking about...

416
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:32,272
the childhood friend of yours that is a police detective

417
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,772
at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department?

418
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:35,872
Yes.

419
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:37,215
I'm going to be transferred to the

420
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,672
headquarters of the Police Department soon,

421
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,872
so I'll be able to work with him.

422
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:44,672
I was planning to tell him how I felt at that time,

423
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:46,772
if I met him and he remembered me but...

424
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:49,227
I guess life just doesn't work out that way.

425
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,872
Gosh, to forget a great lady like you.

426
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:56,372
He's probably not worth anything, forget him.

427
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:58,772
It's not that he's not worth it.

428
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,572
He's as cute and childish looking as ever.

429
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,072
Besides...

430
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:06,772
I was the youngest child in the family

431
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,572
and was really pampered by my parents and was never scolded.

432
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,072
But, back then he...

433
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,172
I'll go home ahead of you.

434
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,372
Because I have a TV program I want to watch.

435
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,172
Don't cross now.

436
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,259
The traffic light's red.

437
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:27,265
Who cares? There are no cars and nobody's watching.

438
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:31,269
I'm watching. And you're watching too.

439
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:34,072
If you pamper yourself and break a rule,

440
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:36,072
it can turn out to be a habit.

441
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:37,572
A habit is something you can't break

442
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:39,072
even if you want to, you know?

443
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:41,572
You mean you don't even know something like that?

444
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:54,772
Really... he hasn't changed a bit, Mr. Chiba.

445
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:17,072
What?

446
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:18,372
You were brushed off?

447
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:21,772
Yeah. Well, I guess so.

448
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:22,972
No joke.

449
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:25,772
I guess she was too high on the pedestal after all.

450
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,372
-Hey... -What're you doing?

451
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,572
We'll resume investigations.

452
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,272
Yes, sir.

453
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:34,372
This is a secret, all right?

454
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,872
Okay...

455
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,872
That's good to hear.

456
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,472
I'm going to tell Miwako about it.

457
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:41,772
About that...

458
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:44,072
If he was brushed off,

459
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,972
that means he's not taken anymore, right?

460
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:48,372
Yes... well, sort of...

461
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:51,772
What's your name?

462
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:54,172
I'm Naeko Miike,

463
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:56,572
who was transferred from the Haido Station.

464
00:23:56,572 --> 00:23:57,872
Nice to meet you.

465
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,160
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,754
"Scratch Wound".

467
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:07,425
What's with that wound?

468
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:07,680
A cat in the neighbourhood meowed at me and...
What's with that wound?

469
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,192
A cat in the neighbourhood meowed at me and...

470
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:41,120
-I wonder about that. -Well, it's true.
