1
00:00:02,244 --> 00:00:06,444
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:09,644
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:12,944
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,144
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,344
With the whereabouts of the owner of the mansion still unknown,

6
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:21,544
when the family takes a family photograph,

7
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:23,044
the eerie owner of the mansion

8
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:26,005
who wasn't supposed to be there was in it.

9
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:29,144
After that, everyone gets text mail from the owner

10
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:31,244
asking them to gather in the dining room,

11
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:32,944
where they witness the eerie figure of the owner

12
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:36,444
floating in mid air and a monster flying through the sky.

13
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:40,944
Then later, the second son's dead body is found.

14
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:43,144
Moreover, the dead body of the oldest daughter

15
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,544
is found in the forest

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,244
and the remaining siblings wait for the break of dawn

17
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:50,520
in each of their rooms. However...

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,244
I'm sure the culprit is that person.

19
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:54,544
Right, Kudo?

20
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,035
Yeah.

21
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,037
But we have no proof.

22
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,644
How did that person go pass the gate

23
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,344
and kill Kamiyo in the forest?

24
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:09,044
Aim for a 100% solution.

25
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,244
Clear all mysteries and codes.

26
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:13,244
The sharp deductions of the two

27
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:15,244
shed light on the darkness of the vampire case.

28
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:16,644
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,544
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:21,544
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:08,167
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Four)"

32
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,581
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,681
I was going to let her drink sake and calm her down

34
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:18,581
but she seems to have fallen asleep

35
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,179
so you can put it away already.

36
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,681
Oh, is that so...

37
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,881
I'm sorry, after you brought it all this way...

38
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,581
Oh, no problem.

39
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:31,481
"Torakura Ruri (38), Asanobu's wife"

40
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:34,481
How about you, Kishiharu? Would like some sake?

41
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,981
No, none for me.

42
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:40,681
I'll go back to my room, lock the door and hit the sack.

43
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:44,781
I've stopped drinking ever since Yoko's accident.

44
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,205
-"Hinohara Hikaru (24), Household Maid" -I see.

45
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,207
I told you to get out!

46
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,881
Johei.

47
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,581
Leave me alone.

48
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,781
Really, I tell you.

49
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:56,215
I just wanted to comfort you.

50
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,581
What's with you?

51
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:01,981
Aren't you sad despite your older sister being killed?

52
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:06,225
I guess so. But, she's only my half-sister.

53
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,381
And she was a formidable love rival too.

54
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:15,381
You mean you think that we were meant to be together after all.

55
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,781
You gotta be joking!

56
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:19,981
How cute!

57
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,243
My, sake.

58
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,481
May I have it?

59
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,281
Oh, sure.

60
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:31,081
I feel like drinking tonight, you see.

61
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:40,881
-"Gunma Prefectural Police" -What? Another one since then?

62
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,261
Has been killed?

63
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,881
Are you serious, Heiji?

64
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:44,881
Yeah.

65
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:48,267
The gate guard heard the ringtone of a cell phone in the forest.

66
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,881
I hope my daughter's okay?

67
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:55,181
Of course. She's carefreely making pot sticks with Kazuha.

68
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,281
Pot sticks?

69
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,281
And? You haven't figure out who the culprit is yet?

70
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:00,279
Yes...

71
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,281
I know already!

72
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,381
Yeah.

73
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,081
That person's the only one capable of carrying out this trick!

74
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:10,681
Then, hurry up arrest him and handcuff him!

75
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,281
Handcuff.

76
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:14,293
We can't.

77
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:19,081
We've got no proof, and an unsolved trick still remains.

78
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,781
Do you think anyone can go out of the gate

79
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,581
without being seen by any one,

80
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:28,681
strangle somebody then sneak back pass the gate again?

81
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:29,881
Huh?

82
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:32,981
Of course, sensors are set up on the fence,

83
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,981
and if someone tries to go over it, they'd be caught immediately.

84
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:38,317
The only time the gate guards left their post

85
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:41,181
was when the tunnel collapsed.

86
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:42,321
How about it?

87
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,981
Maybe the culprit killed Kamiyo inside the fence,

88
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,781
then threw her out and fled?

89
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,881
Idiot!

90
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,081
How much strength do you think the culprit will need?

91
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,881
There's something on my knees.

92
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:02,341
When I checked Kamiyo's body in the forest and got on my knees...

93
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,481
But, what is this?

94
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,481
This white crystallized substance.

95
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,081
Mixed with mud.

96
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:09,881
The feel of this...

97
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:12,081
could it be salt?

98
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,981
But, what would this be in a place like that?

99
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:17,981
But, no matter how much you train using a barbell at a gym,

100
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:19,481
it's impossible, don't you think?

101
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,481
The corpse was tied to a pole, you know!

102
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,681
Bar...

103
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,881
Barbell?

104
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,581
So, now we know for sure.

105
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:34,381
The culprit's not a vampire with wings.

106
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:35,781
Yeah.

107
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,981
They're a demon all right...

108
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,381
But they're more of a bloodthirsty killer!

109
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,981
Mail from the owner?

110
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,881
Come to the European room so that I can tell you

111
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:20,181
what I was going to talk to you about in the morning but couldn't.

112
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:23,781
Of course come here without being noticed by anyone.

113
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,881
Hakuya Torakura.

114
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,981
I wonder what it's about?

115
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,431
Maybe he's fine and knows who the real culprit is?

116
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,481
But, he sure looked like a vampire to me, though.

117
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,881
Hikaru.

118
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:42,441
I would like to talk to you for a minute.

119
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:44,781
Okay.

120
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,881
I'm really getting sleepy.

121
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,281
Oh, no! It's already 5:00 in the morning.

122
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,181
No good, we've got to go to sleep right away!

123
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,881
Oh, the phone. It's from Heiji!

124
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,581
What is it, Heiji? Are you hungry?

125
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,465
There are still plenty of pot sticks, you know!

126
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,281
Huh?

127
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,581
Okay... okay.

128
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:13,981
I got it!

129
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:15,081
You can count on me!

130
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,981
What did Hattori want?

131
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:21,081
Ran, do you have a hairpin?

132
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,081
Huh?

133
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,493
Sir...

134
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,881
Sir!

135
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,481
This is Hikaru.

136
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,681
I've come after reading the mail.

137
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:43,981
Sir.

138
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:50,509
With this...

139
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,511
This is it!

140
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,081
Uh...

141
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,529
Are you all right?

142
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,531
Don't come out!

143
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,581
The only thing you need to help us with is your voice!

144
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:16,981
Yes.

145
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,550
Huh?

146
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,181
He's gone.

147
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,181
True.

148
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,181
He's vanished.

149
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,536
Darn.

150
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:53,536
My body's stuck.

151
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:54,936
Of course it is.

152
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:59,736
That's the corridor that the owner made for Hikaru.

153
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:02,581
Of course it wouldn't fit your body.

154
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,636
Mr. Johei Hagawa?

155
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:12,036
The fact that the owner gave Hikaru clothes as gifts

156
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:16,136
means that he knew her size.

157
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,236
Right.

158
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,536
The tragedy that occurred tonight, the serial killings

159
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,136
was what the owner had entrusted Hikaru to execute.

160
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,136
He texted Hikaru to come to the European room this morning

161
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:28,607
so that he could explain all the tricks that were used up to now.

162
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,636
But, you snatched everything from the side, didn't you?

163
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:34,936
You saw the mail from the owner on Hikaru's cell phone

164
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:39,736
that was being charged in the bathroom!

165
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,036
It seems that Hikaru didn't see that mail

166
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:44,936
until after noon today, you see.

167
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,036
What makes you think it was me?

168
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:51,136
Kishiharu who came before noon could've seen it too, right?

169
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,036
The contents of the mail

170
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:56,936
was for her to come to the European room after breakfast.

171
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:59,236
Even if he did see that mail before noon,

172
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,236
he would think that the owner wouldn't be waiting already, right?

173
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,643
And, even if that mail were to be unread,

174
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,436
the two could've coincidentally met somewhere,

175
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,647
and finished what they were going to talk about already.

176
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,036
Or, he could've thought that the owner who was stood,

177
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,653
decided to forget about it and go to sleep.

178
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,736
If anyone were to have seen that mail

179
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:18,136
and go to the European room,

180
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,336
you and Kamiyo who were there since the night before,

181
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,936
were the only ones who would've gone.

182
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:24,663
Since Kamiyo was killed,

183
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:28,036
the only one left would be you!

184
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:31,936
There's a possibility that the butler and maids also saw it but...

185
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,836
being that the owner was trying to relay

186
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:36,675
something so important by texting means that...

187
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:39,336
he must've been convince that there is no one

188
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,136
in this mansion who would do something so atrocious

189
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:43,336
as to read another person's mail without permission.

190
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:47,336
So, you, being concerned of what the talk was about

191
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:50,689
snuck over to the European room and saw it.

192
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,636
That the owner had cut off his own neck with the guillotine

193
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,436
and died.

194
00:11:57,836 --> 00:12:00,699
I'm sure it was near the corpse of the owner, right?

195
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,136
His cell phone, the key to the freezer

196
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,705
and the switch to explode the tunnel

197
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,436
with this plan of carrying out the serial killings.

198
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,436
Stop talking like you saw me doing it!

199
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:15,036
But this serial killing

200
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,636
is something that cannot be carried out

201
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,236
unless Hakuya cuts his neck off.

202
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,721
One of them is the trick when he suddenly

203
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:25,236
vanished from the coffin!

204
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,727
If he did it on his own, it would've been easy but...

205
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,436
if somebody did it using his corpse,

206
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:34,736
it had to be done using only his head.

207
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:40,036
We got to him as soon as we heard

208
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,741
Kazuha and Ran scream.

209
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,836
I'll bet you snuck over to the storeroom down stairs,

210
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,636
and retrieved the head of the corpse

211
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,536
using the hidden corridor.

212
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,536
The only thing that Kazuha saw that was real

213
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:53,236
was probably just the head,

214
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,136
and as to his clothes, you probably stuffed something inside

215
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:57,536
to make it look real.

216
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:59,336
If his body was real too,

217
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,636
when you pulled his body out of the coffin,

218
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:05,036
it'd have swayed and made noises.

219
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,836
You then used the remote controller

220
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,136
to unlock the lid of the coffin,

221
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:11,536
and while everyone was taken aback in surprise

222
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:13,536
about Hakuya's body having vanished.

223
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:15,336
You took Hakuya's head over to the closet

224
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,336
where the family picture was going to be taken, didn't you?

225
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:22,536
In order to come up with that psychic picture that was taken.

226
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:26,785
There is a bar in the closet to hang clothes on to begin with

227
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,787
so it's easy to hang his head on it too.

228
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,789
You came later than everyone to the coffin room

229
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,136
because you had to do all this, right?

230
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,795
That psychic picture.

231
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:40,236
Since you were beside the magic mirror,

232
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,936
you could've positioned yourself

233
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:45,836
so that Kamiyo wouldn't be reflected in the mirror too.

234
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,536
Back then, if you had the remote controller

235
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,936
to light up Hakuya's face that was in the closet,

236
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:54,236
by using the right timing.

237
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,815
It would've been possible for you to make Hakuya's face

238
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,817
emerge on the mirror!

239
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:01,736
And the last trick was

240
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,936
when Hakuya appeared by the dining room window

241
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,536
hanging upside down!

242
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:08,436
A strange shadow?

243
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:17,236
You waited for Asanaobu at the smoking room,

244
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:20,336
waited for a chance to cut open his artery

245
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,236
and killed him then.

246
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,436
You pulled a fishing line through the hinge

247
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:25,936
of the sliding storm shutter of the smoking room

248
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:29,336
and hung down both ends of the line to the dining room below.

249
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,236
You tied Hakuya's head onto one end of the line

250
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:36,236
then hooked the other end to the frame of the window, right?

251
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:37,736
By doing this, when the window was opened,

252
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:40,859
the line would come off and his head would fall down.

253
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:42,861
Hold it!

254
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,536
When I opened the window, the head vanished above, didn't it?

255
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,536
If that was only his head,

256
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,936
maybe somebody was upstairs and pulled it up?

257
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,536
Convex lens.

258
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:58,877
The upper right pane of that window alone

259
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,736
was made of convex lens, just like a magnifying glass.

260
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,536
If through that lens depending on the angle,

261
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,636
the object looks upside down.

262
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:10,636
That's why although it fell down, it looked like it went up!

263
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:13,536
Moreover, the three panes below the convex lens

264
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,536
are ordinary glass.

265
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:18,336
Of course, if the head looked as if it fell down,

266
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,636
the trick won't work.

267
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:23,236
That's why this trick couldn't have been done by anyone

268
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,936
other than you, who blocked the view of the lower three panes

269
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:28,336
with your own body at the time.

270
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,736
The head finally fell into the pot that was together

271
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,913
with the planters on the veranda outside the window.

272
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,536
When we went to look afterwards, that jar was placed aside

273
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,636
and Hakuya's head was still inside.

274
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,236
Well, we wouldn't have realized this, unless Hikaru

275
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:47,336
told us that she saw the silhouette of Hakuya's head

276
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:49,936
through the curtains

277
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:51,736
during the flash of lightning come from below.

278
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:55,936
The big bird that we saw outside the window right after was...

279
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:57,636
A plane with flapping wings!

280
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:01,236
If you left it on the roof outside of the smoking room

281
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:03,436
and started its motor by a remote

282
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:06,536
just before opening the window...

283
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:08,936
It'd fly away in the sky just as you open the window

284
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:11,636
and that was your setup.

285
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:14,036
Well, as to the plane, I'm sure we'll find it

286
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,636
somewhere in the forest later.

287
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:19,636
Then what about Honey who killed in the forest?

288
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:22,136
Are you saying that I did that too?

289
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,636
The gate guard only left the post for an instant

290
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:27,236
but Honey was tied to a pole, wasn't she?

291
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,736
How could I do something like that

292
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,236
when I never once left the mansion?

293
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:33,936
The wheels made of ice!

294
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:38,036
On both ends of the pole that Kamiyo was tied on,

295
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:41,236
you attached wheels of ice onto it like barbells.

296
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:43,336
Then, while the gate guards

297
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,836
were distracted by the explosion of the tunnel,

298
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:49,336
you rolled it down from the stairs right in front of the gate.

299
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:53,636
The corpse while getting its fingertips all jammed up,

300
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:54,636
went pass the gate,

301
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:57,536
bumped into the trees and stopped in the forest!

302
00:16:57,536 --> 00:17:00,536
All you had to do after that was, wait for the ice to melt,

303
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,536
ring Kamiyo's cell phone

304
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:05,736
and make the gate guards find her corpse.

305
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:09,636
It's humid tonight and it was also raining.

306
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:12,536
On top of that it seemed you mixed salt into the ice

307
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:14,536
to make it melt faster too!

308
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:19,636
By the way, you made the ice wheels using the locked freezer!

309
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:23,636
You stood a can of laver in the center of a toy pool

310
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:26,736
then partitioned them with a sheet of paper or something

311
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:29,027
to make two wheels, didn't you?

312
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,036
You took the ice wheels from the freezer

313
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:35,336
then rolled them over to the stairs so...

314
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,636
the flour that Ran and Kazuha spilled on the floor

315
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:41,039
wiped off leaving a track just the width of the wheels behind.

316
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,536
Gosh, these kids have the nerve

317
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,636
to line up such nonsense despite no proof.

318
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:48,536
You've got the proof, don't you?

319
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:53,336
You didn't delete Hakuya's mail from Hikaru's cell phone

320
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:56,036
because you wanted to frame her later.

321
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,136
Hey.

322
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:00,636
That's why in order to shut Hikaru up,

323
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:03,061
we figured you'd be luring her out somewhere.

324
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,063
"To Hikaru"

325
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:11,336
Together with this murder plan sheet that he made!

326
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:17,075
That's the proof, Mr. Johei Hagawa.

327
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,736
On this plan sheet it says

328
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:21,836
to call Mr. Hagawa over to the European room, kill him,

329
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:26,536
then lock the room and leave.

330
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,036
Just as written on the plan sheet, you acted out

331
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,036
being called over to the European room by Hikaru,

332
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,089
and wanted everybody to think that

333
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,736
you killed her in self defense because she attacked you.

334
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:39,097
So, if you placed the plan sheet next to Hikaru's corpse

335
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,099
and called everybody over,

336
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,536
that would complete the scenario that you counter-attacked

337
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:47,736
the killer who was planning to kill you!

338
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:49,107
Darn.

339
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,436
How'd these brats get to all this...

340
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:54,036
It would've worked out well otherwise.

341
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:57,115
We thought there was something fishy about you

342
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,736
ever since you insisted on

343
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:01,636
having the blood stain on the coffin checked more carefully.

344
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,136
Why?

345
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:04,636
That blood was the blood that dripped

346
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:06,636
when I put the head into the coffin.

347
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,127
The police investigated and concluded that

348
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:11,129
it wasn't Hakuya's blood!

349
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,136
The police goofed on it, didn't they?

350
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:14,936
The blood spot we found at the coffin back then,

351
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:18,936
was it really of type AB?

352
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:20,236
More than that, I think that

353
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:23,141
you should check that blood a bit more carefully.

354
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,136
Like for DNA.

355
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:27,836
Hakuya probably had cancer.

356
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,136
In the final stages, it's possible that

357
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,136
the blood type of the person changes.

358
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,536
If the person has blood type A, he could become blood type AB.

359
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:36,736
If blood type O, then type B.

360
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:40,036
Being able to say that, this is a mistake to begin with...

361
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:44,836
you have to be the one who put Hakuya's head into the coffin.

362
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:48,636
Well, your blood type also changed because of this plan sheet.

363
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:54,536
It seems to have changed into the blood of a ruthless killer.

364
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:22,636
My dear daughter?

365
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,436
The beginning of that plan sheet,

366
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:26,936
did it begin with the line, "My dear daughter"?

367
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:30,036
Yeah. It seems that he lied to the butler

368
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,536
who he figured was kenn, though.

369
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:34,436
There's no mistake about it because

370
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:38,336
a will and DNA certificate were found in his room.

371
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:42,936
You mean he tried to make his real daughter commit a serial crime?

372
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,136
That's right.

373
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,036
After putting fangs on his teeth

374
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:47,736
and making everyone believe that

375
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:50,736
he did all this after turning into a vampire.

376
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:54,236
His motive was to avenge the death of Yoko

377
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:56,536
who was supposed to become his bride.

378
00:21:56,536 --> 00:22:00,336
It seems that Mr. Hagawa is talking his mouth off.

379
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:03,301
Saying that the maid Ms. Shimizu, Kamiyo,

380
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:07,636
Asanobu and himself schemed the accident that lead to Yoko's death.

381
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,636
Which means that the murder of Ms. Shimizu

382
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:11,309
that occurred six months ago...

383
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:14,536
Was committed by Hakuya.

384
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:19,036
It was written on the will that he sucked her blood.

385
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:22,236
But since he was a doctor, he probably

386
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,336
made her drink a drug to inhibit blood coagulation,

387
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:26,736
then inserted a catheter into her artery

388
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,736
and drained her blood.

389
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:33,036
Besides, Hakuya probably tied Ms. Shimizu to the pole

390
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:37,036
to camouflage the ice wheel trick.

391
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:41,836
But, if Hikaru was the one who got to see the plan sheet first...

392
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,136
Things would've been okay.

393
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:46,936
This is what was written at the end of the plan sheet.

394
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:50,236
"But if you decide to forgive everything and everyone,"

395
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,351
"please burn this plan sheet along with the blaze of revenge"

396
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,936
"that's been haunting me from deep within."

397
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:59,736
I'm sure that Hikaru would've chosen to do just that!

398
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:01,936
I bet.

399
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:05,936
But, that guy called Hagawa is totally absurd.

400
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:07,136
The nerve of him to kill his lover, Kamiyo,

401
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,136
just as the plan sheet had it, seeing through the fact that

402
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:10,936
Mina would want to get back together with him again,

403
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:13,736
and that he would eventually get hold of the money.

404
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:18,036
Well, there is no denying he was a foolish man.

405
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:22,136
The least you can do is take good care of her.

406
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:24,336
Women can be scary, you know.

407
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,136
Huh, what on earth are you talking about?

408
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:34,536
Wait.

409
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:42,136
That smell...

410
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:44,136
I wonder how many pot sticks they ate.

411
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,480
"Spoon"

413
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,200
Good work, Kudo!

414
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,210
After the pot sticks, it's okonomiyaki in Osaka.

415
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,800
I mean, I wanna eat pot sticks.
