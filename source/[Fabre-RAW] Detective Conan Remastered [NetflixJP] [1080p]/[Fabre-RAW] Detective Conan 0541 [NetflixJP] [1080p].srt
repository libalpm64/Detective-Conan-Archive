1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,255
My name's Kogoro Mouri,

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:06,855
a famed renowned detective no need for mentioning.

3
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:08,455
The request this time was for me to find an eye-witness

4
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,655
to prove Mr. Gamo's alibi,

5
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:13,993
since he was a suspect of murder.

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,997
The investigation was tougher than first expected,

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,555
and Mr. Gamo called every night demanding results.

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,655
I'm doomed.

9
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:28,007
The following morning, Mr. Gamo was found dead.

10
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,755
Five years ago,

11
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:32,011
Mr. Gamo experienced being mistakenly arrested.

12
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:36,015
Afraid of having to go through the same thing once again,

13
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,017
we first thought that he committed suicide.

14
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,555
But, my eyes could not be deceived.

15
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:44,023
This is a homicide made to look like suicide.

16
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,455
The officer that mistakenly arrested Mr. Gamo

17
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:49,355
"Isao Takeoka (40)" -was my old colleague, Takeoka.

18
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:52,455
After coincidentally running into Takeoka

19
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:54,955
who had quit the forces feeling responsible for his mistake

20
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,037
and decided to investigate the case together.

21
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:02,041
The suspicious one is Mr. Gamo's nephew, Kyosuke Arai.

22
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,355
I'm sure that he's the culprit

23
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,655
because he was in debt

24
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:07,555
and had an argument with Mr. Gamo.

25
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:12,051
However, Arai committed suicide.

26
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,455
Soon afterwards,

27
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:16,055
a witness proving his alibi appears.

28
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,455
Arai wasn't the culprit.

29
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:24,063
And yet I cornered him and lead him to death.

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,155
I'm going to bring down

31
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:28,055
the sign of the detective agency from today on.

32
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,255
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

33
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:33,655
Saturday nights are for mystery.

34
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:36,075
Is this the last case for the famed, renowned Detective Kogoro?

35
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,077
The real culprit is one who betrays all expectations.

36
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:39,755
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:41,555
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:43,355
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:30,189
"The Day Detective Kogoro Mouri Goes Out of Business (Part 2)"

40
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,923
"Mouri Detective Agency"

41
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:39,923
He's totally depressed.

42
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:44,203
But, are you sure that Mr. Kyosuke Arai wasn't the culprit?

43
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,723
The woman who lived next to him testified

44
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,323
that at around 8 pm,

45
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,523
when she was about to turn on the TV.

46
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,323
Time Machine?

47
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:55,623
The readers will never go for something like that.

48
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:58,723
She looked inside next door wanting to complain,

49
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:01,223
and saw him with a FAX sheet that just came in

50
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:04,223
shouting at the top of his lungs.

51
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,423
Mr. Arai was in charge of inserting pictures

52
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:09,523
in a serial detective novel.

53
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:11,123
And he was told that the culprit would be using a time machine

54
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:13,223
to carry out an alibi trick.

55
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:16,723
I guess it's true that readers would never go for something like that.

56
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,223
It takes at least 30 minutes by car

57
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:21,623
from Mr. Arai's condo to Mr. Gamo's residence.

58
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,023
And an additional hour is needed to get from the Gamo residence

59
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,823
to the site where the corpse was found.

60
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,823
He could've never made in time for the estimated time of death

61
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:30,249
which is between 7 pm to 9 pm.

62
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:33,223
So, it's impossible after all.

63
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:37,123
If his next door neighbor heard his voice after 8 pm,

64
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,823
Mr. Arai could've done it.

65
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:44,263
Because if he killed Mr. Gamo in the woods at 7 pm,

66
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,723
he could've returned to his room by 8:30 pm.

67
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,723
That's not possible.

68
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:53,323
Because Mr. Gamo called Mr. Mouri at 8 pm from his home.

69
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,923
What if he faked his tone of voice?

70
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:56,275
Wrong.

71
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,279
The call I received didn't sound like

72
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,281
a different tone of voice.

73
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:07,323
But, Mr. Gamo had a very hoarse voice, didn't he?

74
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,623
So, I don't think you could tell the difference

75
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,223
if someone tried to mimic him?

76
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:14,293
I would never mistake the voice of my client for someone else.

77
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,323
But...

78
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:18,923
Shut up! I've been making a living as a detective for ten years!

79
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:30,723
I wonder who the real culprit X of this case is.

80
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,823
What? The real culprit?

81
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:34,323
"X"?

82
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:36,023
The real culprit who killed both Mr. Gamo

83
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:37,223
and Mr. Arai making it look

84
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:39,923
as if they committed suicide.

85
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,323
If his next door neighbor didn't testify for him,

86
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:44,823
we would've also suspected

87
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:47,723
Mr. Arai as being the one who killed Mr. Gamo.

88
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,923
The more so, now that he's committed suicide.

89
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:53,423
That's exactly what X is after.

90
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:55,823
Mr. Mouri.

91
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:59,223
We're going to re-investigate this case once more.

92
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,339
Excuse me.

93
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:04,343
If there's another culprit,

94
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,123
dad will not be blamed at all.

95
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:09,223
You don't have to quit being a detective.

96
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:10,723
Yes.

97
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:14,353
What's this about real culprit X?

98
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,023
Dad.

99
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:22,361
He's really critically had it.

100
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,623
Geez. There's no other way

101
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:26,823
than for you to give him a slap in the butt, mother.

102
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,367
He's that bad?

103
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,823
"Mouri Detective Agency"

104
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:36,375
It's all right already, dear.

105
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,123
After all, you've kept going for the past ten years.

106
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:41,423
I'm sure you're exhausted.

107
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,923
Mother.

108
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,723
Kogoro!

109
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,523
Just as you promised,

110
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:52,391
you're mine from today.

111
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:56,923
Dad.

112
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:02,423
Animal cookies.

113
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,823
Just like old times.

114
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:07,223
Mr. Takeoka came by the other day.

115
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:12,411
He said that it used to be his wife's favorite.

116
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,323
By the way, about your dad.

117
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:17,823
Is he going around with women like that recently?

118
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:18,923
No, you've got it all wrong.

119
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:20,923
She's not what you think.

120
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,421
Talk about messed up.

121
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,023
Bodyguard.

122
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,723
Getting rid of excess flab.

123
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:27,323
Keep me company when jogging.

124
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,023
Okay, Kogoro?

125
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,023
"Mouri..."

126
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,437
The only way I can make pops snap back to himself

127
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,223
is to make him solve this case himself.

128
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,323
"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo"

129
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,523
Everything began when he got a job request from his client.

130
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,123
All you had to do was agree

131
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,923
to taking on the job I asked you to do to start with,

132
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,223
"Sayuri Tokomae (40)" -Kogoro.

133
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,623
Yes.

134
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:00,223
It was bound to turn out this way either way.

135
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:03,123
She's another one that would benefit

136
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:05,523
from Mr. Ryozo Gamo disappearing from this world.

137
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,823
This is so much fun.

138
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,723
Hey.

139
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,823
Could it be that they want to shut me up

140
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,475
because I've realized the truth.

141
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:24,483
It's this trio.

142
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,723
They've been after my jewelry for sometime.

143
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,023
Excessive? Excessive self-defense?

144
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,923
Just what do you mean?

145
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:35,123
All he did was beat up the thieves.

146
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:38,023
-Why? What's the meaning of this? -Yes...

147
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:40,823
Yes, it sure was a surprise to hear he committed suicide.

148
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,123
There was nothing abnormal in his exam results and yet...

149
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,503
that Ryozo Gamo.

150
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:49,023
Are you talking about Mr. Ryozo Gamo?

151
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,623
Yes. I just happened to run into him here

152
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:54,513
during my physical exam, about ten days ago.

153
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,123
It was last Sunday.

154
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,323
Last week Sunday?

155
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:02,023
I got the job the day before,

156
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:03,923
on Saturday night.

157
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,823
Did he go through a barium test back then too?

158
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,723
Yes, he seems to have refrained from drinking

159
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,023
or eating anything from sundown the day before,

160
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,123
and there was no problem.

161
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:15,323
But, back then at night Mr. Gamo...

162
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,823
It doesn't connect.

163
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,923
Come to think of it, that brat...

164
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:22,023
What if he faked his tone of voice?

165
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,723
It can't be...

166
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,923
But, if I piece them together that way...

167
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:28,547
"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo"

168
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:30,549
Wait a second.

169
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,123
I would never mistake the voice of my client for someone else.

170
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,723
I got it.

171
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,023
Conan.

172
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:43,923
I guess I cannot resign my job as a detective.

173
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:47,423
Moreover I'm not tired!

174
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:54,573
What brings you here?

175
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,575
Maybe we just get along?

176
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,623
No darn way.

177
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,923
Maybe pops also.

178
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,581
Although he used to patronize this shop,

179
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,823
Mr. Gamo's a fairly new customer.

180
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:08,587
He first came here about half a month

181
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,323
before he came here together with Mr. Mouri.

182
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:13,523
About a half month ago.

183
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,123
About two weeks.

184
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,523
About a half a month ago, I think.

185
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,599
No doubt about it.

186
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,603
Pops has also realized the method used by the real culprit X.

187
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:32,123
There are many prints from from the same shoes.

188
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,223
The bath tub.

189
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:38,617
He was hiding here every night waiting for a chance to come by.

190
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,619
Most probably.

191
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:44,423
But, just how do you intend to prove your point, famed detective?

192
00:10:58,623 --> 00:10:59,723
"Haraiso Finance"

193
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:02,023
A recording of Mr. Gamo's voice?

194
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:03,823
A speech to his employees or anything for that matter,

195
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,423
as long as I can hear his voice.

196
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,647
"Reiji Tsuchida (43)" -What about the answer phone at is residence?

197
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:12,323
This is Gamo. I cannot come to the phone right now.

198
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,653
You know, since he recorded his own voice.

199
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,823
Make the call.

200
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,523
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,659
"Speaker"

202
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,223
I cannot come to the phone right now.

203
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,723
Please leave your message after the beep.

204
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:29,023
I wonder when it was changed.

205
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,323
He erased it.

206
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,923
Someone is beating us over here.

207
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,623
Isn't there anything else?

208
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:37,023
Well... come to think of it,

209
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:41,323
there should be a video tape of last year's New Year's party.

210
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:44,683
-Here it is. -Show it to me.

211
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,723
There are no cameras or video deck here.

212
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,623
-None? -No.

213
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,691
Look for an electric shop or a camera shop.

214
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:53,923
You go over there.

215
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:54,693
Okay.

216
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:11,323
Pops, I found one over that way!

217
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,713
Are you okay, pops?

218
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,823
Who the heck...

219
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,717
The tape's gone! It's been stolen!

220
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,123
It could've served as conclusive evidence and yet!

221
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,223
Darn!

222
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,223
Right.

223
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,023
Smiley sweet black bean bun!

224
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,723
Talking about an afternoon snack at a time like this?

225
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:33,823
No, Mr. Gamo complained, didn't he?

226
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,523
I see.

227
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,737
"Nikoniko Bread Co. Ltd" -We've got to record the conversation

228
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,323
to avoid trouble in the future you see.

229
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:44,743
Just as I thought.

230
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,223
Bull's eye.

231
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,923
I've figured out the method,

232
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,823
but who the heck is he anyway?

233
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,323
The guy that framed me as well as killed the two.

234
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,755
"Animal Cookies"

235
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,023
It can't be...

236
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,761
"Josai Police Station" -About the case five years ago?

237
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:05,323
Like I already said a few days ago.

238
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:08,223
Mr. Sakae Kinugasa was attacked by someone

239
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,923
on his way home.

240
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,323
Fortunately it was not fatal.

241
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:15,823
The culprit fled on a car that he had waiting for him.

242
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:18,777
However, there was a woman who just happened to pass by

243
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,779
and saw him being ambushed and attacked.

244
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:25,323
It's him.

245
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,223
The one who was driving the car

246
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,789
was a man in his mid-thirties with long hair.

247
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:34,523
Gamo is helping his nephew out giving him living expenses.

248
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,623
His name is Kyosuke Arai, an artist with long hair.

249
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:39,223
Although he was told that motive

250
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,723
and an eye-witness report were too weak to convict someone,

251
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:44,803
he ignored what people told him and went ahead and arrested Gamo.

252
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,323
However, a few days later,

253
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:50,523
people proving Gamo's alibi appeared

254
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:52,811
and Takeoka was accused of mistaken arrest.

255
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:57,323
Although it's true that Takeoka got a bit carried away,

256
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,817
he didn't have to resign his post.

"Police Detective Hisamoto (50)" -The woman who testified

258
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,523
was Takeoka's wife.

259
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:10,823
"Mouri Detective Agency"

260
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:12,323
Takeoka?

261
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:15,223
It's me, you me, Mouri.

262
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:16,523
Are you drunk?

263
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,123
Totally wasted.

264
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:24,523
I want to see you tomorrow, is that possible?

265
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:28,023
Dad so drunk, I wonder if he's okay.

266
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:30,849
He hasn't drunk at all and yet.

267
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,853
Well, I guess this is a call he can't make unless he acts drunk.

268
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:49,628
Do you remember this place?

269
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,628
Of course.

270
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,328
In summer ten years ago,

271
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:58,877
two couples ran into each other.

272
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,228
Takeoka?

273
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:02,228
Mouri?

274
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:04,883
Although we went to and were classmates of the same police academy,

275
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,328
we were too embarrassed to talk about our wives,

276
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:09,628
and never talked about them.

277
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:12,228
Back then, we first got to talk to each other's wives.

278
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,893
You got married when you were a student?

279
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,028
Yes, sort of.

280
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,228
We were childhood friends actually,

281
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:18,897
or rather, ended up stuck with each other.

282
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,899
What do you mean stuck with each other.

283
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,928
We got to know each other in college.

284
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,828
We both belonged to the drama club.

285
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:27,928
You mean this awkward guy was in the drama club?

286
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,928
Shut up! I used to be pretty keen back then.

287
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,928
It's been ten years already.

288
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:40,128
We were both young back then.

289
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:42,528
Are you sure the culprit's going to come here?

290
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:45,528
That's what pops told me.

291
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,928
Just as I thought, he's having a tough time saying what he wants to.

292
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,628
I guess I'll have to do it, then.

293
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,428
The detective revives.

294
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,128
My prayer's been answered.

295
00:15:56,128 --> 00:16:00,328
I've got to let pops solve this case himself.

296
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,528
About the case we're investigating now...

297
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:10,228
The culprit, after finding out that Mr. Kinugasa was murdered,

298
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:11,928
planned everything.

299
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,953
The plan was to kill Mr. Gamo making it look like

300
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,428
he committed suicide,

301
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:19,428
and setting his nephew, Mr. Arai up as the murderer,

302
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,428
then killing him off too.

303
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:23,228
But, if the culprit wanted to make it look like Gamo committed suicide

304
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:26,028
and set Kyosuke Arai up as the killer,

305
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,967
why did he have to bring Gamo all the way out to a far place

306
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,828
and make it look like suicide?

307
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,428
To set up an alibi.

308
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,975
At 7 pm, the culprit, drives his own car

309
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,979
and takes Mr. Gamo to the scene of the crime and kills him.

310
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,728
He then hides his car in an abandoned warehouse

311
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:46,428
near the Gamo residence.

312
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,728
Then at 8 pm, the culprit poses as Mr. Gamo

313
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,428
and gives me a call.

314
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:53,628
He leaves the Gamo residence in Mr. Gamo's car

315
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:56,028
and hides the car for the time being in the abandoned warehouse.

316
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,428
He spends time with the person he had arrangements to see beforehand

317
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:00,528
at 8:30 pm and stayed together until after midnight.

318
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:01,528
After the meeting,

319
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:04,128
he goes back to the abandoned warehouse to get Mr. Gamo's car

320
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:07,005
to move it into the woods.

321
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,428
So long as I'm talking to Mr. Gamo at 8 pm,

322
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:15,028
Mr. Gamo had to have died after 9 pm.

323
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,428
And the culprit also had an alibi during that time

324
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,728
because he was with someone.

325
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:23,328
In other words, you're saying that the last call you got from Gamo

326
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:27,928
was the culprit mimicking his tone of voice?

327
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,828
Right.

328
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:31,528
But dad said he would never mistake

329
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,528
the voice of his client for someone else.

330
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:34,828
But, Mouri...

331
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:37,035
Is it possible to deceive the ears of a former police detective

332
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,028
and private detective such as you?

333
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:43,041
If it was only that one time, I wouldn't have been deceived.

334
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,045
But the culprit had been repeating his trick from a half a month ago,

335
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,728
in order to deceive me.

336
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:52,028
From the first time he called.

337
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,528
My name is Ryozo Gamo.

338
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:56,428
I would like you to find somebody who can testify

339
00:17:56,428 --> 00:18:00,428
that I was at Akebonocho on the day of the crime.

340
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:04,628
The one who kept calling me every night

341
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:07,828
asking for results was not the real Gamo.

342
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:16,128
I never ever met or talked to the real Mr. Gamo on the phone.

343
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,528
Isn't that right?

344
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,428
Drama boy back in your younger days, Takeoka.

345
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:25,528
Mr. Gamo's characteristic appearance

346
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:28,628
and voice were most convenient to copy, right?

347
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:30,728
However, since I've known for quite some time,

348
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,828
there was a risk that I would see through your disguise.

349
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,928
That's why you deliberately came late that night

350
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,428
when you came to see me.

351
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:38,728
He says to give you his apologies,

352
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:41,428
but to go ahead and start without him.

353
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:46,128
You wanted to get me drunk and divert my concentration.

354
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:47,105
-On top of that... -Mr. Gamo,

355
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,728
I hope to be seeing you again soon.

356
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,128
-Mr. Gamo. -I wouldn't doubt you,

357
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,828
being that you virtually convinced

358
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:54,728
all those around you of being someone else the way you did.

359
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:58,428
It's only natural that the request made for finding a witness

360
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,528
to prove alibi didn't go well.

361
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:02,228
Because after all,

362
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,228
the content of the request was fake to begin with.

363
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,128
In order to keep anybody from getting to you

364
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:09,127
from the telephone records, you...

365
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,228
It's Gamo. You haven't come up with anything yet?

366
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,628
You waited for Mr. Gamo to take a bath

367
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:17,528
and called me every night on a cordless phone

368
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,928
or something that you secretly set up.

369
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,143
You've seen through everything.

370
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,828
I guess, I was setting up useless tricks.

371
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:30,128
Running into you at the horse race tracks

372
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,328
wasn't a coincidence either, was it?

373
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:33,528
No.

374
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,153
Why?

375
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:38,128
I'm sorry that I used you.

376
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,528
Why'd you kill the two?

377
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,528
Now, after five years have gone by!

378
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:50,328
My wife... she died last month.

379
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:55,173
After suffering with an illness for two years.

380
00:19:55,173 --> 00:20:02,628
She apologized to me just before she passed away.

381
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,128
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:05,728
About what?

383
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,187
About five years ago.

384
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,193
I was surprised

385
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,028
that she had been regretting it all along

386
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:23,201
that her testimony cornered me into resignation.

387
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,928
But, I kept on believing her testimony.

388
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,528
I kept thinking that the witness for Gamo's alibi

389
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:33,211
was just somebody that he had paid off to testify.

390
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,328
And the day after her funeral,

391
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:39,217
after finding that Sakae Kinugasa was murdered,

392
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,219
I called Gamo.

393
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,228
Wasn't it you?

394
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:46,728
Just like you attacked the victim in the dark five years ago.

395
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:49,227
This time it's wasn't me.

396
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:54,128
I guess this is what you call the slip of the tongue.

397
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,928
His said, "This time it's wasn't me".

398
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:58,228
In other words, he did commit the previous crime.

399
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:01,928
Natsuko's testimony was true.

400
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,728
She spoke the truth,

401
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:07,245
but I refused to believe her

402
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,728
and she died apologizing to me.

403
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,028
All I wanted to do was clear her feelings of grief.

404
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:19,257
Mouri, make up with Eri.

405
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:23,261
Don't be silly, blurting something like that out.

406
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,528
Takeoka!

407
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,265
Mr. Takeoka!

408
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,267
Takeoka!

409
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:33,028
Takeoka!

410
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:34,228
Where are you?

411
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,028
-Takeoka! -There he is!

412
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,028
What?

413
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:39,828
It can't be...

414
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,028
Hold it!

415
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:43,828
No way!

416
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:52,828
You're not dying on me.

417
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:56,528
Live! You're making up for what you did!

418
00:21:56,528 --> 00:22:00,328
I'm not letting you die on me, Takeoka!

419
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,299
Mouri!

420
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:04,928
Mr. Takeoka!

421
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,228
Mouri.

422
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,728
Takeoka.

423
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:35,128
Dad, you don't have to put the sign down for real.

424
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,528
Pops.

425
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:38,928
I always keep my word.

426
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:45,403
A new one sure is good after all.

427
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,405
You're not quitting being a detective?

428
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,728
I never said anything like that.

429
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,411
True, you only said was that you were going to bring the sign down.

430
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:56,128
Being a detective is a lonesome job

431
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:57,828
very usually misunderstood by others.

432
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,880
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,052
"Fish names".

434
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,894
Eels, eels over rice, eel cookies,

435
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,427
grilled eels, eel porridge, and eel soup.

436
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:11,060
They're all different types of eel dishes.
