1
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,330
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,730
Today's episode is a true suspense story.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,630
Two incidents happen in places that are far apart.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,030
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,930
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,630
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,890
"Bay of Revenge (Part 1)"

9
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,890
What a nice sunset.

10
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,190
Just watching it, takes all of today's exhaustion away.

11
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,590
You're right.

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,790
I'm about to forget that

13
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,590
you got stingy about paying rental car charges,

14
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,890
so we end up being stalled in a place like this.

15
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,290
Am I right, Conan?

16
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,190
Is anything wrong?

17
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,990
This is the entrance to our villa.

18
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,090
"Private Area, No Entry" -It's not a parking lot.

19
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,190
Or did you want to talk to me?

20
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,190
I'm so sorry. We've come on a family trip,

21
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,190
but the car broke down.

22
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,290
My name is Kogoro Mouri.

23
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,590
Please don't worry, we're not suspicious people.

24
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,190
What? You're that renown detective Mr. Mouri?

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,090
So, you know me. Yes, I am Mouri!

26
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,590
Pardon me for my rudeness!

27
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,590
"Keisuke Tachibana (62), Lawyer" -I'm Keisuke Tachibana,

28
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,090
and I run a law firm in Tokyo.

29
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,390
You're the Mr. Tachibana that I hear of every time

30
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,890
there is trial for well-known cases?

31
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,190
He is the lawyer that'll do anything for money if I remember correctly.

32
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,290
Well, most of the cases that I handle are dangerous

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,790
that I'm always in a fix because of people coming after my life.

34
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,590
And he's my secretary, Mr. Sakuraba.

35
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,790
"Yuichi Sakuraba (29), Secretary" -I'm Yuichi Sakuraba.

36
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,790
Nice to meet you all.

37
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,490
Look up the number of a mechanic for them, will you?

38
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,690
Sure.

39
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,490
Well, please drop by at the villa for a while.

40
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,190
After all, it's not every day

41
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,790
that I get a chance to listen to your stories.

42
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,590
Thank you so very much!

43
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,790
Johan, we've got guests.

44
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,490
How cute!

45
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,790
"Johan"

46
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,090
Good boy. Your name's Johan?

47
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,090
He's got a very unique type of fur. What kind of dog is he?

48
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,890
Well, I don't know.

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,490
The maintenance man of this villa picked him up.

50
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,390
I'm just keeping him as a watch dog.

51
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,390
Is that right? Well, aren't you a lucky dog, Johan!

52
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,690
This is indeed a case of Buddha in Hell!

53
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,690
I thought that I'd have to give up eating fish for tonight,

54
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,490
but to think that I get to eat all this food!

55
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,490
This is really delicious.

56
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,490
We just caught all the fish,

57
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,590
and besides, Yaeko is really a good cook.

58
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,190
"Yaeko Kamei (50)" -It's all rural food, that's embarrassing.

59
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,490
Yaeko.

60
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,490
Yes?

61
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,290
Please bring me some red wine and a risotto to go with it.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,290
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away.

63
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,490
"Yuki Tachibana (43)" -Welcome, everyone.

64
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,790
"Mr. Tachibana's Wife" -I am his wife, Yuki Tachibana.

65
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,690
I thought you were going to be asleep tonight?

66
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,490
After hearing that Mr. Mouri stopped by here tonight,

67
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,690
I regained my appetite.

68
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,390
Would you all like to have some wine too?

69
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,390
I don't think so, because we're having some local sake just yet.

70
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,090
Yes, hot Japanese white wine.

71
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,190
That's embarrassing.

72
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,390
Who could it be at this time of night?

73
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,690
It's Ms. Sugimura.

74
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,890
Yes, please come in.

75
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,190
Good evening.

76
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,490
What brings you here at this time of night?

77
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,690
I just had something I want to tell Mr. Tachibana.

78
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,190
Mr. Tachibana!

79
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,590
We got another one of those letters again at the office!

80
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,190
I didn't want anything to happen while you were on vacation,

81
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,990
so I figured that it'd be better to bring it over.

82
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,790
Mr. Mouri, he is the accountant of my office.

83
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,190
"Noriko Sugimura (48)" -Sugimura here!

84
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,890
"Accountant" -Mr. Mouri? Are you by chance...

85
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,490
Right. He's the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

86
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,690
Why don't you go ahead and join us all for dinner too, Ms. Sugimura?

87
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,590
Thank you very much.

88
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,190
What? You don't have the parts?

89
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,190
You mean you can't get it until tomorrow. Now, what'll we do?

90
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,890
Mr. Mouri! Why don't you spend the night here?

91
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,390
You were on a trip anyway, weren't you?

92
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,190
This is the Tachibana residence,

93
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,490
please repair the car so it works like new even if it takes time.

94
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,790
Yes, thank you.

95
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,790
So, Mr. Mouri, please take it easy to your heart's content.

96
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,190
Talk about rich.

97
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,690
A western style mansion made of stone and a hot spring white cedar bath!

98
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,990
Lawyers sure must make a lot of money!

99
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,390
It just goes to show that

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,490
Mr. Tachibana is the type of lawyer he is rumoured to be.

101
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,390
What's with these figures?

102
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,390
Don't tell me that you're embezzling money from the office?

103
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,290
This has been happening ever since I've left accounting up to you!

104
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,490
I wonder if a man who can't even control the way his wife wastes money,

105
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,790
has any right to say anything about accounting.

106
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,490
I hear that your wife is taking revenge on you.

107
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,690
Revenge?

108
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,690
Will you hurry up and divorce her,

109
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,590
make money under the table, circulate finances

110
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,290
or do something for the sake of the office?

111
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,790
You'd better do something before the person who named T.K kills you!

112
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,390
She's scary.

113
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,790
What does she mean by revenge?

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,290
And, the initials T.K...

115
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,090
Hey! Do you have anything on her yet?

116
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,390
No, not yet.

117
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,690
Gosh! That's why you can never pass the bar exam!

118
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,090
Pardon me, sir.

119
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,490
You're the one who's not giving me time to study!

120
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,490
Why do I have to do things other than my own duties?

121
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,290
How dare you to talk back to me!

122
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,790
Your rudeness will not be accepted anywhere!

123
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,090
I can't eat anymore.

124
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,690
Johan, you sure can eat, can't you?

125
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,290
You're up already?

126
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,090
Good morning!

127
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,590
Did you sleep well last night?

128
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,690
Yes, thank you very much.

129
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,590
I'll go get big catch today too,

130
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,790
so you can expect a delicious dish today.

131
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,090
I'm sorry for us intruding on you like this.

132
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,690
Don't worry about it.

133
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,790
Take your time and relax here until your car is repaired.

134
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm enjoying your company here too.

135
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,290
Mr. Tachibana, your lunch.

136
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,090
Take care of things for me then, will you?

137
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,790
Bye!

138
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,090
Johan is barking.

139
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,290
I wonder what's wrong?

140
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,090
I'm sorry, I think he wants to go for a walk.

141
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:37,390
I was busy in the morning since Mrs. Tachibana decided to go home.

142
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,390
God, I'm in a fix. I have to head back to Tokyo right now.

143
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,490
We could take Johan for a walk for you.

144
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,890
We must do something to repay you for all the hospitality we're receiving.

145
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,390
Right, dad?

146
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,990
I guess so. We've got to go to the repair shop anyway too.

147
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,990
Really?

148
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,790
That would really be a great help.

149
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,790
No problem, no big deal!

150
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Hey, wait, Johan!

151
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,990
Cut out your running!

152
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,290
Hey!

153
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,290
I'm telling you to stop! I'm tried!

154
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,290
Hey, break time! Break time!

155
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,490
I'm not going to move an inch from here!

156
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,190
You two sure get along, don't you?

157
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,890
No way! I'm just trying to get along with him

158
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,290
because his master's been so nice to us!

159
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,290
What's up, Johan?

160
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,390
Johan, where are you going? Wait for me!

161
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,990
Do you like boats, Johan?

162
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,290
Maybe he knew someone on the boat.

163
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,090
Well, it sure looks delicious!

164
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,590
Thank you for your treat.

165
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,490
-Thank you for your treat. -Thank you for your treat.

166
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,690
The view is fantastic and it sure feels good.

167
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,090
What? Isn't something wrong with that boat?

168
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,390
It's tilted at such a sharp angle.

169
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,890
Don't tell me that's Mr. Tachibana's boat?

170
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,390
What?

171
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,590
Hey! It's capsizing!

172
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,890
Oh, no!

173
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,190
Yaeko, please call the police!

174
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,490
Yes, sir.

175
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,280
Well, everyone.

176
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,180
Are you sure that he is Mr. Keisuke Tachibana?

177
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,580
Yes.

178
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,580
There is no mistake.

179
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,880
"Officer Inoki (28)" -It just happened to be high tide,

180
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,780
"Officer Inoki (28)" -so we had a difficult time to rescuing him.

181
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,380
"Police Officer" -I'm sorry it turned out this way.

182
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,280
What?

183
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Officer, wasn't Mr. Tachibana wearing a life jacket?

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,380
Yes, I'm sure he was wearing one when he left this morning!

185
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,380
Are you sure?

186
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Then why isn't he wearing it now?

187
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,380
There are people who take their life jackets off when it gets hot.

188
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Therefore, we have a lot of accidents like this happening!

189
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,880
But, it's winter now.

190
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,080
No matter how warm they say this part of the region is.

191
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,880
He could've stayed afloat if he was wearing his life jacket and yet.

192
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,580
My God, and I warned him to be careful because the waves were high.

193
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,880
What a thing to have happened.

194
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,180
The more so, it's hard to believe that he would take off his life jacket.

195
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Excuse me, may I ask who you are?

196
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
"Hiroshi Inuyama (70)" -I'm Inuyama,

197
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
"Boat Rental Shop's Owner" -who rented the boat out to Mr. Tachibana.

198
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,980
I own that rental boat shop over there.

199
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,880
To tell the truth, a boat the same model as the one he rented was stolen.

200
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,080
I wonder if you could look for it while you're at it?

201
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
Are you sure?

202
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,880
Yes! The kids saw a guy wearing a red baseball cap sail away on it.

203
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,780
We saw that boat too! From the cape over there!

204
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,880
And, which way did it go?

205
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,980
Where would that direction be?

206
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,880
Since it was the road below the cliff,

207
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,580
the boat was blocked by it and sailed out of sight.

208
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,480
That is the direction where Mr. Tachibana had the accident.

209
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,180
Then, it could be that the boat rammed into Mr. Tachibana's boat!

210
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,880
But, we saw it about two hours before the accident.

211
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,480
There are something bothers me about that man.

212
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,380
It could be the man who came to the villa once before.

213
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,680
What?

214
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,480
A man who came to visit Mr. Tachibana about two months ago

215
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,880
was also wearing a red baseball cap.

216
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,780
He had an argument with Mr. Tachibana.

217
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,680
If he was the same man,

218
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,680
he probably stole the boat to get close to Mr. Tachibana.

219
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,080
We'll begin a search for the boat immediately!

220
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,380
That'll be a great help!

221
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,880
Officer.

222
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,180
What is it you want? I'm afraid no one is back yet.

223
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,380
We've got the results of the autopsy.

224
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,080
What shall we do, Officer Baba?

225
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,180
"Officer Baba (42), Police Officer" -Let's wait!

226
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,980
I'd like to watch Mr. Mouri make his deduction too.

227
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
Okay.

228
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,080
What do you mean you want to watch Pop's deduction?

229
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,880
Well, Mr. Mouri is pretty well-known around here too.

230
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,080
Besides, according to the rumour,

231
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,180
I hear he dances to Yoko Okino's music as he makes deductions!

232
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,880
The so-called, "Dancing Kogoro"!

233
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,580
Just what are they talking about anyway?

234
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,580
What? Sleeping pills?

235
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,280
That's what you found in him?

236
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes, it seems that after taking the sleeping pills,

237
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,780
he fell in the water while asleep and drowned.

238
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,980
Did Mr. Tachibana show any signs of the possibility of committing suicide?

239
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,180
I wonder, suicide...

240
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,880
He could never have been thinking of suicide!

241
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Because...

242
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
I'll go get big catch today too,

243
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,380
so you can expect a delicious dish today.

244
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,180
He also told us to relax and make ourselves at home

245
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,880
because he enjoyed our company.

246
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,680
I see.

247
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,180
Which means somebody must've made him drink it.

248
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,680
Yaeko, welcome back.

249
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,580
I just got back.

250
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting. I'll get dinner ready right away.

251
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,480
Ms. Kamei? Out shopping?

252
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,880
Yes, because the people from the office will also be gathering here.

253
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,780
I can see that you're busy,

254
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,580
but could we ask you a few questions?

255
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,680
Yes.

256
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,080
What kind of lunch did Mr. Tachibana take with him?

257
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,780
Sandwiches and hot coffee.

258
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
What kind of sandwiches were they?

259
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Hamburger, pickles, vegetable salad and onions.

260
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,980
Exactly what came out in the autopsy.

261
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,480
Which means that Mr. Tachibana ate his lunch.

262
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,980
And Mr. Sakuraba was the one who gave the lunch to Mr.Tachibana?

263
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,180
Mrs. Tachibana suddenly asked me to do something for her,

264
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,180
so Mr. Sakuraba gave the lunch to Mr. Tachibana for me.

265
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,180
So, that's makes it possible for three people

266
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,580
to have mixed in sleeping pills.

267
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,780
No way! Nobody would put something like that inside!

268
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,780
What's this about sleeping pills?

269
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,380
Mr. Sakuraba?

270
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,580
-Yes. -Do you know that Mr. Tachibana has passed away?

271
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,080
Yes, I heard so from the officer in the parking lot just now.

272
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,480
By the way, where were you until this time of day?

273
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,980
I... I was at the Tokyo office

274
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,380
to do something for Mr. Tachibana!

275
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,980
I heard that the boat that Mr. Tachibana was in capsized and he drowned.

276
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,180
Now, what does this have to do with sleeping pills?

277
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,180
It seems that someone sneaked sleeping pills into his coffee.

278
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,580
I don't belive it.

279
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,480
The guy who was wearing the red baseball cap may have done it.

280
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,280
Right, that's another possibility!

281
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,580
It seems a strange letter was received too. Right, Mr. Sakuraba?

282
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,080
A strange letter? What is that?

283
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Mr. Tachibana had been receiving blackmails recently.

284
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,780
Blackmails? Why didn't you mention it earlier?

285
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,080
Here they are!

286
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,780
The same thing is written on all three of them!

287
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,380
"If you don't want your lawyer's license revoked,"

288
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,480
"get three million yen ready. T.K."

289
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,580
This is indeed blackmail!

290
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
In the diary it says,

291
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,280
"The guy is a hopeless devil,"

292
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,580
"blackmailing me after I win him an innocent verdict"

293
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,580
"despite the crime that he committed."

294
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,480
Mr. Sakuraba, do you have any idea who the initials T.K stand for?

295
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,080
No, that's...

296
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,280
You're not being very clear.

297
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,780
According to the diary it looks to be

298
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,080
that Mr. Tachibana won this person an innocent verdict

299
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
knowing that this T.K committed the crime,

300
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,580
and you knew nothing of it?

301
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,880
No, I just happened to come across the letter

302
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,380
when I was clearing the papers out.

303
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,080
Mr. Tachibana got angry and told me to forget about it.

304
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,180
Well, the people of the office have arrived.

305
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,480
We'll go over right now.

306
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,080
"Umio Fujisawa (45), Lawyer" -I came to get Mr. Tachibana's body,

307
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,480
but I was told I couldn't.

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Is there something suspicious about his death?

309
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,080
Well, there were some trivial things we wanted to check on.

310
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,980
Where is Mrs. Tachibana?

311
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,380
She waiting at her residence with the other members of the family.

312
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,480
Where is Ms. Sugi... who was it?

313
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,580
You mean Ms. Sugimura?

314
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,080
She's off on Saturdays and Sundays and seems to have gone out.

315
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,880
We can't get a hold of her.

316
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,880
There it is!

317
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,080
This is...

318
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
A red baseball cap!

319
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,780
We've got to report this immediately to Officer Baba!

320
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm sorry to be intruding on you so early in the morning,

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
but we found what looks to be evidence.

322
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Have any of you seen this red baseball cap before?

323
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,080
It's the same color as the one who was sailing the boat was wearing!

324
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,880
I see.

325
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,080
What about you, Ms. Kamei?

326
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,880
Yes, I'm sure it looked like that.

327
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,380
Actually, there is a name on this cap.

328
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,280
Please take a look.

329
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,880
Do you have any idea who this name Kumada refers to?

330
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,580
No, not at all.

331
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
How about you?

332
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,380
I have no idea.

333
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,080
Hey, Mr. Sakuraba, isn't Mr. Kumada the one that

334
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,980
Mr. Tachibana defended about five years ago?

335
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,180
The hearing that they had the same year you came to Mr.Tachibana's office.

336
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
Yes. Is it him?

337
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,280
Did that person get an innocent verdict?

338
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,580
Yes, although the circumstances seemed to be against him,

339
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,780
Mr. Tachibana won him an innocent verdict.

340
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,880
His name was Tatsuya...

341
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
I think it was Tatsuya Kumada!

342
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,580
Tatsuya Kumada?

343
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,980
The initials would be...

344
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,380
T.K!

345
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,080
So, we've got a connection here with the initials

346
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,480
that were on the letters of blackmail!

347
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,180
This could be!

348
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,580
Although the man called Kumada was blackmailing Mr. Tachibana,

349
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,580
but he was probably being ignored!

350
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,280
Or maybe Mr. Tachibana on the contrary told him that

351
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,180
he would press charges of blackmail against the guy!

352
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
So, he goes all the way to where Mr. Tachibana is fishing

353
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,680
and forced him to drink sleeping pills,

354
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,080
took off his life jacket and drowned him.

355
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
It fits in, Officer Baba!

356
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,680
Okay, Officer Inoki.

357
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,380
Let's go search for Kumada as a prime suspect!

358
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,380
Yes, sir!

359
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,880
But, just think that he's living in a place

360
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,580
only 25 minutes from the villa!

361
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,680
That makes him even the more suspicious.

362
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes, I guess we've got him!

363
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,680
How come you're tagging along?

364
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,280
Because I witnessed the man wearing the red baseball cap!

365
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,180
It's strange,

366
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,880
I hear that he is a night owl who is asleep in the mornings.

367
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,380
The door's not locked.

368
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,780
What?

369
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,080
Mr. Kumada, we're coming in.

370
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,680
What... What is this?

371
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,680
The suspect Kumada...

372
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,480
has committed suicide.

373
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,160
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,040
"The name of the dog"
