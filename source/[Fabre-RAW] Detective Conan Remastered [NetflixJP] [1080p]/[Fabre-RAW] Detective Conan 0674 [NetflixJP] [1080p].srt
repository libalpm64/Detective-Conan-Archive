1
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:05,427
What seemed to be at first glance a simple request came in

2
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:08,627
through the newly opened website of the detective agency.

3
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:10,727
But the client send a text saying

4
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,727
he wanted to change the place of meeting,

5
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:14,927
Pops accompanied by Ran and I

6
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:19,227
and his disciple Amuro, set off to the designated place.

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,927
But the client doen't show up.

8
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:24,127
After that we returned to the agency,

9
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:26,627
where we were contacted again by the client

10
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,027
and got ready to leave, but...

11
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:33,727
Don't tell me that...

12
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,727
What?

13
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,127
It was thought that the man who came to the detective agency

14
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:48,727
and took the woman hostage, thinking he couldn't flee,

15
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:52,027
committed suicide by shooting himself.

16
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:54,127
After Kei finished undergoing interrogation,

17
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:56,327
we gave her a lift home.

18
00:00:56,327 --> 00:01:00,027
There were a lot of wiretaps set up there.

19
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,527
As we continued to look for the wiretaps,

20
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:04,827
we find something under bed.

21
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,327
In the meantime, I tagged along with Kei

22
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:18,027
when she said she was going out shopping.

23
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:22,027
I almost end up drinking juice laced with sleep pills in the car.

24
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:23,827
But I saw through her scheme in the nick of time,

25
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:26,627
and found out her true identity too.

26
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,527
Her name is Serina Urakawa.

27
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:33,627
In order to avenge the death of her boyfriend,

28
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,227
Kenya Shono who was shot to death by the three bank robbers,

29
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:39,227
she had committed one murder after the other.

30
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:41,727
In the meantime, Pops and the others,

31
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,127
with the help of Amuro were getting close to the truth of the case.

32
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,827
Therefore, they were headed toward the remaining woman

33
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:49,727
who was thought to be one of the robbers.

34
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:54,127
Furthermore, Dr. Agasa and Ai who received contact from Ran,

35
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:57,727
come after us on Okiya's car.

36
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:00,227
Masumi, who was to join Ran and the others,

37
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:02,327
also sped along on her motorbike.

38
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:06,227
From here on, it's my imagination but...

39
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:09,127
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

40
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,327
you checked Kei's address

41
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:13,427
using Kenya's address book

42
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:17,327
and went to visit him, right?

43
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:20,327
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

44
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:23,027
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in,

45
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,227
and you were greeted at the door

46
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,827
by a small framed man who was living with him.

47
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:29,227
Unluckily, you found his gun,

48
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:32,827
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

49
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:35,627
he attacked you in order to silence you,

50
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:38,627
but was beaten to death by you instead.

51
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:44,227
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return

52
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:45,827
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

53
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,427
being made in the living room.

54
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:50,227
So, afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

55
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,627
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

56
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:55,527
and set up wiretaps.

57
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,727
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

58
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,327
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

59
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:04,727
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

60
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,627
So he called the other robber

61
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:10,427
and suggested that they take the rest of the money and split.

62
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:13,627
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

63
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,527
he didn't know where the locker was.

64
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:20,027
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

65
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:21,727
So, Kei Kashizuka

66
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:24,127
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

67
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:28,127
look for the locker!

68
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,427
That's why you tried to ambush Kei Kashitsuka

69
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,927
at the detective agency

70
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:35,527
and get information out of him about the other partner.

71
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:38,027
Is that right?

72
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:42,427
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,827
I thought that I'd find out

74
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:48,927
who that guy was talking with thanks to this phone's call history,

75
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:53,027
but he was careful and erased it all.

76
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:55,827
In that case, we have no choice

77
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:58,727
but to go see those three women that you called.

78
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:02,827
Let's start with the closest one to us, Rinko Toyokita's flat.

79
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,227
The vivid colored memories of summer

80
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,040
solve mysteries all season round.

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,280
It started from a bank robbery

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,800
and lead to Bourbon of the Organization.

83
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,880
He sees through the one and only truth.

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,800
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,300
His name is Detective Conan.

86
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,400
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Bourbon)"

87
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,200
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,410
Yeah.

89
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,080
What is it? What a nuisance.

90
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,790
We moved to this apartment today.

91
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,580
Right, Mom?

92
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,800
This isn't much.

93
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,090
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

94
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,800
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
and is normally asleep at this time...

96
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,310
so please be careful next time.

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,310
Oh, wait.

98
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,310
Something smells good.

99
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,890
-It's omlette! -Hey.

100
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,900
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Don't you ever come here again!

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,910
I wonder if no one's home?

103
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,200
Oh, my.

104
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,990
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

105
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,080
We've come to say hello since we moved here.

106
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,580
Oh, is that right?

107
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
But, you don't have to do that

108
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,880
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,090
Why?

110
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,590
I won the lottery.

111
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,470
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,180
Oh, that's right.

113
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,390
I hate to trouble you but will you go throw this away for me?

114
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,980
But, it seems that in this area,

115
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,270
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

116
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,770
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

117
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,690
Thanks for your help!

118
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,990
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

119
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,700
Yes, who is it?

120
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,790
We just moved here today,

121
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,500
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

122
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,290
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,090
I don't accept things like that.

124
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,510
Hey, what do you do?

125
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,590
I'm a writer.

126
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,800
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,100
All she eats are beef bowls.

128
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,600
Oh, that's right, will you do me a favor?

129
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,110
Could it be that... you want me to take the trash out for you?

130
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,990
So, how about it?

131
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,280
Did you figure out who the robber is?

132
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,910
Yep, of course.

133
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,080
But, I can't tell you who it is.

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,370
What do you mean?

135
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,790
Why not?

136
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,580
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

137
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,090
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

138
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,470
Were there any moves after that?

139
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,310
Go left up ahead.

140
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,480
It's about 5 kilometers straight.

141
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
It seems they're moving

142
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,690
but it seems that they walking judging from this speed.

143
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,900
I see. If so,

144
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,280
we'll probably catch up with them in about 10 minutes.

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,990
I wonder what they're walking around for, though.

146
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,990
I wonder.

147
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,870
Since Conan's doing so,

148
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,210
I'm sure he has something up his sleeve.

149
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,590
Ran.

150
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,090
I don't think this would be of any comfort to you,

151
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,180
but I don't think any danger will fall upon Conan just yet.

152
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,480
If we don't heed the warning of the mail we got a while ago

153
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,980
and decide to report this to the police,

154
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,270
the culprit will need Conan as a hostage

155
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,400
to get through the check point if there is any.

156
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,280
But, if she's after killing the remaining robber,

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,080
it may be that he is messed up in what she's about to do.

158
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,210
Dad!

159
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,710
Yes,

160
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,590
that's why the fact that he's in a dangerous situation hasn't changed.

161
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's hurry.

162
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,680
Don't be silly.

163
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Just what're you talking about, sonny?

164
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,270
Saying you don't want me to die.

165
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,770
Don't tell me that you think I'm planning to commit suicide

166
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,070
after I kill the last of the bank robbers?

167
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,200
Yep! Aren't you?

168
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,280
I guess you thought so because you saw the sleeping pill case

169
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,290
in the pocket of my coat.

170
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,710
I had it on me because I find it difficult to fall asleep recently.

171
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,290
It's a very small amount, and I could never die using that amount.

172
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,380
It came in handy to use on you when I kidnapped you, so I used it.

173
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,010
Although you figured it out and didn't fall asleep.

174
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,470
See? Your crimes are too full of holes.

175
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,890
The same goes for those sleeping pills.

176
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,680
And the first man that you killed too.

177
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,980
You did okay to the point where you hid him in the suitcase.

178
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
But to hide the wiretap together with the corpse

179
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,270
was not a good idea.

180
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,990
You probably wanted to hear Kei Kashizuki scream in terror

181
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,780
at finding the corpse

182
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,790
but what you did, was like telling everybody

183
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,290
you wiretapped the entire room.

184
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,500
So, people would get wary on the contrary.

185
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Moreover, you were careless enough

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,590
to leave the gun that you struck and killed the man with,

187
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,800
that had its grip stained with blood inside the dashboard of your car.

188
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,970
With the other gun.

189
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,890
If you include the gun that you used to kill Kei Kashizuka

190
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,390
at the detective agency,

191
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,100
it would total three guns.

192
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,600
Those guns that were used in the bank robbery,

193
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,900
you found them in Kei Kashizuka's room

194
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,190
and brought them with you, right?

195
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,280
After you killed Kei Kashizuka,

196
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,220
it was totally wrong for you to switch your cell phone for his.

197
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,620
It seems you erased all the mails

198
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,640
and telephone contacts that were in your cell phone

199
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,560
but all the police had to do was to contact the telephone company

200
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,020
to find out who the cell phone belongs to.

201
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,960
Right. Your actions are all just temporary solutions.

202
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,100
They're not planned out at all.

203
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,400
You didn't give a hoot about losing memorable mails,

204
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,280
photos and telephone numbers of intimate friends.

205
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,300
So long as you could avenge the death of your boyfriend

206
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,820
who was killed by the robbers,

207
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,240
you could care less about what would happen in the future.

208
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,980
In other words, it means you have no attachment to this world anymore, right?

209
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,020
That's why I came along with you

210
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,000
in order to keep you alive.

211
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,360
But, I also came along with you

212
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,520
because I wanted to find out who the last of the bank robbers was.

213
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,520
So, if you promise to do as I say,

214
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,740
I'll tell you who it is.

215
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,500
If my deduction convinces you,

216
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,180
leave that culprit to the police and turn yourself in.

217
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,260
Will you promise to do so?

218
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,780
Okay.

219
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll do as you say, sonny, so tell me who it is.

220
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,300
The last skinny robber.

221
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,240
She was among the three women we met a while ago, right?

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,020
Yep. You saw too, didn't you?

223
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,720
The image on the surveillance camera of the bank robbers.

224
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,900
It was pretty easy because the characteristics of the skinny bank robber were obvious.

225
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,520
Characteristics?

226
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,660
In that image

227
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,740
when the skinny bank robber tried to go over the counter,

228
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,680
she stuck her left leg out first, right?

229
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,060
When people try to go over something,

230
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,450
the first step is taken by the dominant foot,

231
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,450
and most people have the same dominant hand and foot.

232
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,870
She was holding the roll of masking tape with her right hand

233
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,290
and pulling the tape out with her left.

234
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,870
When the other robber fired the gun,

235
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,750
the hand that she stretched over to her mouth was also her left hand.

236
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,670
People try to calm themselves down

237
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,880
by touching their faces when they are flustered

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
but the hand that they use unconsciously is their dominant one.

239
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,550
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

240
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,350
by holding the gun with her right hand.

241
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,970
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

242
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,850
Left-handed?

243
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,650
Then, the culprit is...

244
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,160
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

245
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,870
by holding the gun with her right hand.

246
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,750
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

247
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,460
Left-handed?

248
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Then, the culprit

249
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,050
is the first one we visited, Ms. Toyokita?

250
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,050
She opened the door with her left-hand.

251
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,470
If a door opens in that way,

252
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,640
there are times when a right-handed person would use her left hand.

253
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
If the right hand is used,

254
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,560
the hand would come in front of the body and would be in the way, you see.

255
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,780
She would have to answer the visitor with her body faced sideways.

256
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,100
In the first place, she's right handed.

257
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,140
The handle of the cup that was on the table
In the first place, she's right handed.

258
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,140
The handle of the cup that was on the table

259
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,640
was positioned for a right handed person when viewed from the chair.

260
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,560
The handle of the frying pan was on the left

261
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,440
and the spatula was on the right,

262
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,560
which means she was cooking with her right hand.

263
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,650
If the butter knife isn't used with the right hand,

264
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,150
the butter wouldn't stick to the left side of the blade either.

265
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,950
As for the second woman, Ms. Furuya, she's also right handed.

266
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,450
Because she unlocked the door with her right hand.

267
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,540
If so, the third person called Ms. Tegawa is...

268
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,250
Yep! The handle of the cup on the table faced left.

269
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,460
The memo pad was to the left of the telephone,

270
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,340
and this means that she takes notes using her left hand.

271
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
The lamp was on the right of the desk

272
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,850
so that her left hand wouldn't cause a shade when writing.

273
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,560
The pen and side table were also on the left.

274
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,060
Besides, she...

275
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,440
In order to get rid of us right away,

276
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
said that she was a writer pressed for deadline.

277
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,070
But no matter how many times you tried calling her,

278
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,070
her cell phone was switched off, wasn't it?

279
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,740
No matter if she has a house phone.

280
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,660
There's no way that a writer pressed for deadline

281
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,080
would have her cell phone switched off.

282
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,660
She found out that the man had died

283
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,250
at the Mouri Detective Agency through the news

284
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,170
and thought that Mouri had found out

285
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,170
that Mr. Kei Kashizuka was a bank robber.

286
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,680
So, afraid that the police would call her

287
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,350
after finding her number from his cell phone contacts,

288
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,850
she switched it off.

289
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,350
That's right. I forgot to mention it,

290
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,270
but the main reason I figured that Kei Kashizuka

291
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,150
was one of the bank robbers

292
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,070
was the large amount of loose change and bills he had on him.

293
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,780
5000 yen in loose change

294
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,950
and 47 1000 yen bills

295
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,370
is just too much for a person to be holding.

296
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,660
That was because the serial number of the bills was known by the police.

297
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,750
So, he shopped for a lot of cheap things

298
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,380
and changed the 10,000 yens in question.

299
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,250
That's the same reason Ms. Tegawa brought home a lot of beef bowl take-outs

300
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,840
and ate only that.

301
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,170
Moreover, the meal ticket vending machine at the beef bowl shop,

302
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,050
takes 10,000 yen bills.

303
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,560
If she buys take-outs, she doesn't have to stay back at the shop,

304
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,140
thus, won't have to risk her face being remembered.

305
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,770
Unlike convenience stores and brand-name shops,

306
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,150
a lot of those shops are not equipped with surveillance cameras.

307
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,770
Choosing those kinds of shops,

308
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,150
even if they were to find out that the bills in question were used there,

309
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,740
no images would be recorded.

310
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,740
How about it?

311
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,160
Are you convinced and willing to turn yourself in?

312
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,460
Yes, I guess so.

313
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,540
Out of respect for your deduction,

314
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,250
I guess I'll go to the police.

315
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,840
But your deduction just one part is wrong.

316
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,350
I only took two guns from the room of the man called Kei Kashizuka.

317
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,470
The other one is a model gun that looks real

318
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,980
that I got for self-protection from a gun mania friend of mine.

319
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,940
Of course, there are no bullets for it.

320
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,070
If so, where's the other real gun?

321
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,450
You know too much, so I can't possibly let you go at this point.

322
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,450
It was you after all.

323
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,450
Just a little while more.

324
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,540
They're around the corner to the right, a little way up ahead.

325
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,670
Okay.

326
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,460
At any rate, let's tell Ran of this.

327
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,340
I don't think so just yet.

328
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,180
We don't know what condition Conan is in yet.

329
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,970
I don't want to think of the worst,

330
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,770
but I don't want to give her false hope.

331
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,850
Oh no...

332
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,560
Let's contact her after we get a hold of the situation ourselves first.

333
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,770
Okay.

334
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,150
And just in case, I'd like to warn you too that.

335
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,740
Even if you find the car that he is riding or the car itself,

336
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,160
don't do anything rash.

337
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,250
Because by doing so, you may put his life in danger.

338
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,250
I know!

339
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,540
I'm not a child, you know!

340
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,880
True.

341
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,250
Come on, hurry and get this car going!

342
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,050
I'll take you to a nice place where there's nobody around!

343
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,260
I didn't realize she was following us.

344
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,060
Damn! My left hand is blocked and I can't fire my tranquilizer gun!

345
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,640
Go on! Quit dilly-dallying.

346
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,940
Did you just hear what sounded like a gun shot?

347
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,570
It's that car!

348
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,160
Conan's in that car.

349
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Then, please contact Mr. Mouri about this.

350
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,740
Not the police?

351
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,040
They're the only ones

352
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,670
who can accurately report what happened to the police.

353
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,840
If they give the model, color and license plate number of the car, and ask the police to set up a checkpoint, we can stop them.

354
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,260
But, what if she uses the hostage

355
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,970
to bust through the checkpoint.

356
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,680
If that should happen...

357
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,270
If that should happen, we'll stop them by force.

358
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,480
What?

359
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,860
The car with the brat inside is headed up north along Ooishi Highway?

360
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,360
Ooishi Highway, isn't it this road?

361
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
And, what kind of car is it?

362
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,370
A blue compact car. The license plate number is?

363
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,950
A blue compact car...

364
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,450
Hang on!

365
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,670
You rat!

366
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,270
What?

367
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,940
What is this feeling?

368
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,560
Something is...

369
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,770
It feels like something is closing in.

370
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,570
Don't make that face.

371
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,740
I won't let them get away.

372
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,370
Doc, grab the wheel.

373
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,250
The wheel? What?

374
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,670
Subaru, just what're you up to?

375
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,350
Mouri Sensei, please keep that seatbelt on the right fastened as is please.

376
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,060
Ran, please unfasten your seatbelt and come here.

377
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,360
What? Unfasten it?

378
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,740
Hey. What the hell?

379
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,670
What's with you guys?

380
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,260
Go for it!

381
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,340
What?

382
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,350
I'm glad! You're okay!

383
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,470
How come she's here?

384
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,850
Conan!

385
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,850
How come they're here?

386
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,450
Really now...

387
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,370
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,160
I guess you've gained a bit of their trust, but...

389
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,250
You'll keep your word with me, won't you?

390
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,670
Bourbon.
