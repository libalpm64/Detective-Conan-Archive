1
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:24,164
Today's stage is also at the breakwater.

2
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:25,864
The place was in such clear view and conspicuous.

3
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,664
The trick and the culprit, we'all catch them both!

4
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:29,164
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,064
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,964
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:57,918
Hey, Ejiri?

8
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,118
Get a hold of yourself! Snap out of it!

9
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:03,518
His lips are turning purple,

10
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:05,818
cyanosis is starting.

11
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:08,418
This is proof that he cannot breathe as he should.

12
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:13,518
Still I can feel his pulse by touch,

13
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:16,418
and his heart is beating quite okay,

14
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:19,418
which means possible brain damage

15
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:22,418
or neurotoxic poisoning!

16
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:28,818
Artificial respiration!

17
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:30,918
We've got to take this man on the ship

18
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,318
and head him off to the hospital!

19
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:35,218
Hang in there, okay, Ejiri?

20
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:36,418
Hurry!

21
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,418
Dear!

22
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:43,818
Don't move!

23
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:49,318
It's extremely likely that he was poisoned!

24
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,118
And the one who poisoned him

25
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:56,418
is possibly someone who is here at the breakwater!

26
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:00,918
Until the police get here,

27
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:04,518
don't touch anything and stay still!

28
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,418
What's up?

29
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,518
Who are you, sonny?

30
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:12,318
Conan Edogawa.

31
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,718
A detective.

32
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:20,718
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 2)"

33
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:24,618
First,

34
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:27,418
let's start with hearing about how you are all connected with each other.

35
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,018
"Kiriko Shirane (38), Mineto Kanetani (39)" -All of us

36
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:32,618
belonged to the same fishing club since our university days.

37
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:36,118
Including Ejiri, who was carried off a while ago too.

38
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:39,318
Do you come to fish at this breakwater frequently?

39
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,318
Yeah.

40
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,518
"Iwao Ida (39)" -On board the ship of the fisherman Ida.

41
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:47,918
Which means all of you know each other quite well from some time back.

42
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,418
Yes, especially Ida and I

43
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:52,118
because our parents who are fishermen also know each other well.

44
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:54,118
We've known each other since we were kids.

45
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:57,818
I see! You were saying that you're the daughter of a fisherman.

46
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:01,618
Yeah, she's really knowledgeable about fish

47
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,618
and was really popular with men in the club too.

48
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,218
Moreover, she's a good cook and a beauty.

49
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,718
She was the Madonna of the fishing club.

50
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,718
Please cut it out, Kanetani.

51
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,618
Let's not talk about something so long in the past.

52
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,218
Is that why someone attempted to kill Mr. Ejiri?

53
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:20,218
Because Ms. Shirane was taken away by Mr. Ejiri.

54
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,818
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:23,018
Just a while ago,

56
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:25,018
when Ms. Shirane was about to run over to him,

57
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:28,018
she called him "dear".

58
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,318
Unless they have an intimate relationship,

59
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:33,718
she wouldn't be calling him that way, would she?

60
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,118
Then, the perp is the one

61
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:37,818
who had to go through a broken heart and held a grudge against him.

62
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:40,218
Mr. Kanetani! You did it, didn't you?

63
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,518
Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,318
Besides if that was my motive,

65
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:49,618
the fisherman Ida would also come up as a suspect.

66
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:51,618
What? Mr. Ida?

67
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:55,718
Because Ida was Shirane's fiance.

68
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:57,618
Fiance?

69
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:59,918
Besides, that's not possible.

70
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,818
Why not?

71
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:06,718
Because Ejiri and I got a divorce three years ago.

72
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:08,418
Huh? Why?

73
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,318
Well, a lot of things were involved.

74
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:13,218
But the fact that we both like fishing hasn't changed.

75
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:14,318
So on holidays or on our day off,

76
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,618
we invite Kanetani and come fishing together.

77
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:20,718
And? You always made everyone's lunch?

78
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:24,318
See, this lunch that Ejiri ate.

79
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:27,718
The size of the lunch box and the handkerchief it's wrapped in

80
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:32,418
is the same as the one Mr. Kanetani got from Ms. Shirane.

81
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:35,418
It's true that it looks just like Mr. Kanetani's lunch.

82
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,618
Don't tell me that the lunch was poisoned.

83
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,218
No way! I would never do something like that!

84
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,618
Besides, as far as that lunch is concerned,

85
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:46,918
I got it from Shirane on our way to the breakwater

86
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,318
and I gave it directly to Ejiri.

87
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:53,018
The lunch boxes are exactly alike and nobody knows who'll get it.

88
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:56,218
How can poison be put in something like that?

89
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:57,518
That's true.

90
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,118
The pole stand is in the water?

91
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:05,718
This is one of the two that Mr. Ejiri had erected.

92
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:09,718
The other pole stand is still standing okay, and yet why?

93
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:22,018
This case sure is hard to grasp.

94
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:26,518
Maybe the poison was smeared on the hook and swung around?

95
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:29,518
I see, the way they do in lure fishing.

96
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,018
That can't be.

97
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,718
Besides, it would be to difficult to pinpoint the part

98
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,418
where the skin is exposed in one fling.

99
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:36,818
If it works, it's just mere chance!

100
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,818
And if the poisoned hook is soaked in water for some time,

101
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,818
the poison would drift off.

102
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,118
So, the lunch was poisoned after all.

103
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:47,018
No, it's very unlikely.

104
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:50,618
If poison were to be in something that was chewed on,

105
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:55,018
I would've been poisoned too because I performed artificial respiration.

106
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,118
I see!

107
00:06:56,118 --> 00:07:00,718
Which means that you knew he wasn't poisoned from the mouth.

108
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:06,318
No. I can't figure out where the poison was inserted.

109
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:10,118
And all I knew back then was that I had to perform artificial respiration

110
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:13,418
or he would've died there.

111
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,518
Hey, you!

112
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,218
Can't this ship go any faster?

113
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:25,118
Please stop rushing, officer.

114
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,018
What's this smell?

115
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:30,118
Hey, isn't smoke coming out?

116
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,318
Well, you're the one who keeps telling me to go faster!

117
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,818
The police sure are late.

118
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:39,118
They sure are. Well, I guess everything'll be okay!

119
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:42,718
The culprit is one of the two anyway!

120
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,318
As long as we keep are eyes on them.

121
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:49,018
Right, the fisherman wasn't here with us all this time so.

122
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:51,718
You can't be too sure.

123
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,718
If he made Mr. Ejiri drink some sleeping drug

124
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:58,518
with delayed effect beforehand.

125
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:00,818
When he came to pick us up,

126
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:04,218
he could've gone up to Mr. Ejiri to check out what was wrong

127
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,518
and poke him with a poison needle then.

128
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,018
Hey, wait!

129
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:12,118
You mean you let a possible killer and Dr. Agasa go together?

130
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:16,418
Yeah. There was no other way to save Mr. Ejiri's life.

131
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:17,918
I did give Dr. Agasa the tranquilizer gun though,

132
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,618
just in case something comes up.

133
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:25,418
Besides, if anything happens, Dr. Agasa 's going to call...

134
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,218
The phone?

135
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:29,718
Hello, Dr. Agasa?

136
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,118
-Hello... -Oh, Shinichi!

137
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:36,018
I just got Mr. Ejiri on the ambulance now!

138
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,618
And, how is he?

139
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,418
It's hard to say yet.

140
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,818
The type of poison hasn't been specified either.

141
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,218
Maybe if a doctor were to examine his left wrist

142
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:49,018
the type of poison may be specified.

143
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:50,218
Left wrist?

144
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:51,318
Right!

145
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,418
Although it was hidden with his sleeve,

146
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:57,218
there were traces of scratches there.

147
00:08:57,218 --> 00:09:00,218
I'm sure that's how he was poisoned.

148
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:05,018
Incidentally, there was something that looked like glue on the sleeve!

149
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:07,218
Glue? You mean the plastic type?

150
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:11,618
Yeah. That stuff is not used for fishing, so isn't it odd?

151
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,918
Well, I'll give you the details when I get there.

152
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,118
Later, then.

153
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:18,518
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

154
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,818
Glue.

155
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,918
What did Dr. Agasa say?

156
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,118
He said he got Mr. Ejiri on an ambulance

157
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:26,318
so he's coming back here!

158
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:29,118
-That's great! -I guess everything's okay for now.

159
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,318
I wonder who the culprit is though?

160
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:36,218
He taught me how to put bait on my hook.

161
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,718
And, the lady, see!

162
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:41,318
She picked this bobber that got drifted away up for me.

163
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:43,318
She said she saw it floating in the water

164
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:46,818
so she picked it up with a net.

165
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:49,018
The fisherman seems to have taken Mr. Ejiri

166
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:53,618
to where the ambulance came to pick him up too.

167
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:58,118
At first, he seemed to be looking down on us because we're kids, but...

168
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:01,518
You mean when he told you not to make too much noise?

169
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,718
Yes. We may be kids,

170
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:05,118
but we won't dance or carrying around portable shrines

171
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:07,018
in a place like this!

172
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,218
Right?

173
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,718
Dancing and carrying portable shrines?

174
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:13,318
Hey. Tell me exactly what the fisherman said.

175
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:14,518
Let me think...

176
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:15,818
He said, don't make too much noise

177
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:18,818
and start an "Omatsuri" (Omatsuri means festival) with your friends!

178
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,218
I told him we won't start an "Omatsuri",

179
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:26,118
then he said, go ask the other people.

180
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:29,018
No. "Omatsuri" is fishing terminology...

181
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:33,818
Bobber, glue and "omatsuri".

182
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:36,518
I see. So, that's it!

183
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:37,718
Conan?

184
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,818
Don't tell me you've figured out who the culprit is!

185
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:42,218
Yeah. I figured out

186
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:46,218
who was trying to fish Mr. Ejiri's life with a poison hook

187
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:48,918
as well as the way it was done!

188
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,289
Sea bream! This is sea bream for sure!

189
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,489
Okay, all of you, enough for the detective thing already, right?

190
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,489
No!

191
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,689
You're saying that so that you can hide the evidence, right?

192
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:13,089
Listen. It's true that Ejiri didn't look all that great.

193
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,289
But we're not even sure if he was really poisoned or not yet, you know?

194
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,389
In the first place,

195
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,389
Ida, who took Ejiri to where the ambulance,

196
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,489
is a suspect too, right?

197
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,289
If he's the one,

198
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:29,389
then the evidence would've been disposed in the sea long time ago.

199
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,089
I guess so, but...

200
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,289
That's no problem

201
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,289
because Dr. Agasa who went with him, is keeping an eye on him.

202
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,589
Moreover, the possibility of Mr. Ida being the culprit

203
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:41,089
has drastically decreased.

204
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,989
Now that we know he safely took Mr. Ejiri to the ambulance

205
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:48,289
and is heading back this way with Dr. Agasa again.

206
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:51,389
Is that right, Conan?

207
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:52,389
Remember what I said?

208
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,489
If Mr. Ida were the culprit,

209
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:58,289
he would've had to run over to Mr. Ejiri that he put to sleep beforehand

210
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,989
and poke a poison needle into him.

211
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:03,989
The poison that was used is probably neurotoxic poison.

212
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,689
He would have difficulty breathing but he would be conscious.

213
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:10,689
If someone poked a poison needle into him, he would know who it was.

214
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,989
The culprit would never rush such a person to the hospital, right?

215
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,689
Even if he would've done so, not to be suspected,

216
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:20,189
he would've fled off somewhere already.

217
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,289
Because when the poison wears off and Mr. Ejiri is able to talk,

218
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,489
the culprit would be revealed.

219
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:26,689
I see.

220
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:32,089
So that means the culprit has to be either Ms. Shirane or Mr. Kanetani.

221
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,289
Hey, how long is it going to take you to make repairs?

222
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,089
Please don't rush me like that, officer!

223
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:46,789
Darn it. We still have no idea what kind of case it is, and yet...

224
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:51,889
Are you saying either one of us is the one who poisoned Ejiri?

225
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:54,189
Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:58,889
It's true that we were fishing on both side of Ejiri,

227
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,589
but he was fishing on the tip of the tetra pod,

228
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,289
so he more than 10 m away from us.

229
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,189
How could we have poisoned him?

230
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,789
"Omatsuri".

231
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,989
"Omatsuri"?

232
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,689
"Omatsuri" is a fishing terminology

233
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:18,289
that is used when two lines get tangled with each other.

234
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:21,189
You know what to do when that happens, right?

235
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:23,889
I see! The culprit took advantage of him wanting to untangle his line,

236
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,389
in which he would bring his fish hook near his hand!

237
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,389
So, the comment of the fisherman...

238
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:31,389
Don't make too much noise

239
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,289
and start an "Omatsuri" (festival) with your friends.

240
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:36,489
was not an insulting remark at all.

241
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,489
Right. The culprit deliberately

242
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:42,089
got the fishing line tangled with Mr. Ejiri's.

243
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,189
And, when Mr. Ejiri tried to untangle the line,

244
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,889
it's slightly pulled on

245
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,389
and the poisoned hook would sink into Mr. Ejiri's hand!

246
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,889
But, you did also say that

247
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,989
if the hook smeared with poison is soaked in the water for some time,

248
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:57,389
the poison would dissolve.

249
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,889
Yeah... If the poison was just smeared on to the hook,

250
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,689
then the poison would dissolve,

251
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:05,289
but it's a different story if glue is used.

252
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,989
-Glue? -Glue?

253
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,389
Yeah. If poison is mixed into the glue

254
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,889
and then smeared onto the hook and dried hard.

255
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,089
It would start to dissolve when soaked in salt water

256
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,089
and by the time it gets tangled with Mr. Ejiri's line.

257
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,789
It would be gooey and just right for use.

258
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,089
As proof of this,

259
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,689
Dr. Agasa just told me on the phone that

260
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,689
there was glue on the left sleeve of Mr. Ejiri's shirt.

261
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:31,089
He also mentioned that

262
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,589
there were traces of scratch marks on Mr. Ejiri's left wrist!

263
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,689
That's probably why Mr. Ejiri's pole stand was in the water too.

264
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,089
His pole stand?

265
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:48,289
Yeah. When the fishing line was pulled to sink the poison hook in,

266
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:52,389
the pole stand was pulled too and fell into the water as well.

267
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,689
But, can you really do something like

268
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,889
deliberately getting your own line tangled with somebody else's.

269
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,189
Of course you can!

270
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:04,489
You use a lot of hooks with poison smeared on them and use light sinkers.

271
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,489
Then you let it drift along to the flow of the current

272
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,589
and it gets tangled super easily.

273
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,789
If the poisoned hook is a fly hook,

274
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,389
when it is pulled up,

275
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,489
even if there were to be many hooks attached to it,

276
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:19,089
nothing strange would be thought of it!

277
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:20,189
I see.

278
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:23,789
And? Which of them did that?

279
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,789
I just said, didn't I?

280
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,689
That the line was tangled using the flow of the current, right?

281
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:31,789
Remember she picked up your bobber that drifted away, Ayumi?

282
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,189
Yes! She did.

283
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:36,789
In other words, if Ms. Shirane, who was on the right edge,

284
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,389
picked up your bobber,

285
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,989
the flow of the current was from left to right.

286
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:45,289
And if the culprit took advantage of the flow of the current.

287
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:48,689
Right, the one who was fishing between Mr. Ejiri and all of us.

288
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,789
Mr. Kanetani!

289
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,989
You're the one who did it, right?

290
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:56,589
Wait... Is that true, Kanetani?

291
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,889
No way. No need to take what kids say all that seriously.

292
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,289
Besides, what makes you think I'd do something like that

293
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,889
at a breakwater like this?

294
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,289
I mean there're only so many of us

295
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,289
and the possibility of becoming a suspect is so high.

296
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:13,589
No. The suspects were narrowed down merely because of coincidence.

297
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,689
Back then, if the fish didn't bite his line,

298
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,789
we won't go over thinking that it's strange that he showed no reaction.

299
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:23,289
If he was left as he is, time would just pass by,

300
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:29,189
the estimated time of death would've been expanded

301
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,889
and there would've been a lot more suspects.

302
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,589
And you're the very one who said that

303
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,589
you wanted to change fishing spots because no fish were biting.

304
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,789
I see.

305
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,389
So, Mr. Ejiri who said that he wanted to stick it out here till night,

306
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,889
would've been left behind alone.

307
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:43,489
And if everyone else moves to a new fishing spot,

308
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:45,289
it could've been made to look as if someone came along in a boat

309
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,189
and poisoned Mr. Ejiri who was fishing all by himself.

310
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,889
Yeah. Besides, there are many people here that would testify that

311
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,489
Mr. Kanetani never once went near Mr. Ejiri too.

312
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:59,789
But if the hook poked him, he would at least let out a cry.

313
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:03,089
So, you set the timing for when to hook it on, right?

314
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,689
That is, to the sound of the ship that came to pick us up.

315
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:09,489
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

316
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:10,489
I see!

317
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,289
He erased the sound of the scream of pain

318
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,289
when being poked with the sound of the of the ship!

319
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:15,889
Moreover, the direction the ship came

320
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:18,289
from was opposite the direction that everyone was fishing.

321
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,589
Everybody attention would be distracted from Mr. Ejiri,

322
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,289
so it would be like killing two birds with one stone.

323
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,689
But, sonny, you don't even have proof.

324
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,089
This pole of yours is the evidence.

325
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,089
The bobber is sunk

326
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,289
so it should still be there.

327
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,289
Mr. Ejiri's pole that got tangled with your terminal tackle!

328
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,889
The glue that was mixed with poison probably almost completely dissolved.

329
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,389
But, that would not dissolve so easily.

330
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:52,389
Mr. Ejiri's blood that is on the hook that scratched him.

331
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:56,389
Kanetani.

332
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,789
Kanetani, may I ask why you did it?

333
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,489
Why would you want to kill him?

334
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,689
We just went drinking the other day all three of us together, didn't we?

335
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:10,189
The reason is his remark when we went drinking.

336
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,589
When you left the seat,

337
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:16,789
I asked him why you both got a divorce.

338
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,389
What? A lover?

339
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,089
Yeah. I just started a new business back then

340
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,589
and I was going through a lot of stress.

341
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:31,189
She found out that I was having an affair and left me.

342
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:33,189
He said that?

343
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:36,789
Yeah. I had no intention of saying anything

344
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,189
about the fact that he got a divorce of had a lover,

345
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:45,289
but I just couldn't forget what he said after all that.

346
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,589
Well, I guess in the end, be it a company, fish or women,

347
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:51,389
the best part is when they are alive and kicking.

348
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,189
Don't tell her this, okay?

349
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:57,389
Yeah, it was like he had shattered the dream of my younger days.

350
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:00,289
I just couldn't take it in.

351
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:03,589
Because you were really our Madonna.

352
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:04,789
Don't be silly.

353
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:09,189
He divorced me for my sake.

354
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,189
What?

355
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:14,389
Back then, his company was on the verge of bankruptcy.

356
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:18,789
And he couldn't save his employees unless he started a new business.

357
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,689
But, in order to do so, he had to take on an enormous amount of debt.

358
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:26,489
He got on his hands and knees begging me to divorce him.

359
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,589
He begged me saying that if the new business fails,

360
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:32,889
I'd end up having to face the collectors too.

361
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,389
I wanted to overcome the situation as husband and wife.

362
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,089
But since his stubborn and not too strong taking on pressure.

363
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:45,389
And as for me, I wanted to continue my job as a cuisine essayist I agreed.

364
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,389
So, that thing about a lover is a story he made up to put on a front.

365
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,889
I don't like that comment

366
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,089
he made of women who are alive and kicking though.

367
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,789
No, there's no need to get angry.

368
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:58,989
Because he was referring to you,

369
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,389
when he said women who are alive and kicking.

370
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,789
While sailing on the swaying boat,

371
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:07,689
Mr. Ejiri kept repeating to himself over and over again.

372
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:09,289
A fish that is truly alive and kicking

373
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:12,289
is one that can freely swim through the ocean.

374
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,989
He asked me if I thought so too.

375
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:16,989
What an idiot.

376
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:22,089
Oh, my God. What on earth have I done?

377
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:26,189
Don't worry! He seems to have recovered quite a bit already.

378
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:31,789
I got a call from Ejiri, who sounded okay.

379
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,989
He asked me to relay a message to you.

380
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:39,789
He said for you to get super fresh fish for her today.

381
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:42,089
If you do, he says he'll forget what happened today.

382
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,289
He said he would tell the hospital and police that

383
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,889
he was poisoned by a pufferfish that he cooked and ate on his own,

384
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,889
so to not come back until you get big catch.

385
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,889
Is today a special day or something?

386
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:56,989
Oh, my? Come to think of it, today is our wedding anniversary.

387
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,089
Your anniversary? If I'm not mistaken today is...

388
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,689
Don't tell me you forgot?

389
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:05,789
Happy Birthday, Dr. Agasa!

390
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,689
Kojima, which means that you were trying to...

391
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:12,389
Yeah, fish something for Dr. Agasa's birthday present!

392
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,889
No, Genta! Don't say a word about it!

393
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,689
We've been keeping it a secret from Ai too

394
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,989
so that we could throw a surprise party.

395
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:20,789
Oh, sorry...

396
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,289
I see. That's why these children

397
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:26,489
were planning to have a curry party at my house tonight.

398
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:28,389
Thank you all so much.

399
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,489
Don't cry.

400
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,989
I was trying to fish you a sea bream

401
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,989
but ended up fishing some odd black fish.

402
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:36,389
Hey. Isn't this is black sea bream?

403
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:37,489
Black sea bream?

404
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,389
The King of breakwater fishing, black sea bream!

405
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:41,889
It's an expensive fish!

406
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,389
Incredible!

407
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,389
-It's too much for Dr. Agasa, then. -I'd love to eat it.

408
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,989
So now it's your turn, Kanetani!

409
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:54,489
Get me a big one that is just as good as the one he fished, okay?

410
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,889
Because I've got to show him that.

411
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:01,089
That even if fish are caught, good fish is good.

412
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:34,689
Well, although there were an array of odd occurrences,

413
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:38,089
wasn't coming to the ocean a good idea?

414
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,589
Yes.

415
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,989
Now I understand how fish feel.

416
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:44,289
Just what do you mean by that?

417
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,689
The body temperature of humans is too warm for the fish.

418
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:52,889
Right, it's too warm for me too

419
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,589
that I feel as if I'm going to get burned.

420
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,689
Hey, hey, it's still not repaired?

421
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:34,416
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,316
"Chocolate cake"

423
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:38,416
The next episode is an one hour special that takes place in Osaka.

424
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,916
You've sure got a lot of things happening around you, Kudo.
