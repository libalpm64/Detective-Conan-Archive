1
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,530
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,030
A beautiful and mysterious lady makes an appearance in today's episode.

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,030
An odd request is the entrance to the case.

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,430
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,030
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,430
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,310
"A Client Full of Lies (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,810
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,510
You say, you're looking for someone?

11
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,510
Yes. There is a person that I really want to see.

12
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,110
Well, I'm so sorry, but I happen to be tied up just now.

13
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,810
Please, will you help me, please?

14
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,310
To tell you the truth, I'm right near your office already.

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,410
If it's okay with you,

16
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,810
I'd like to at least be given a chance to talk to you.

17
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,610
The winner is, Kaminari-Boy!

18
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,010
He has won the final race with his graceful legs!

19
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,110
Oh no... I lost again.

20
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,110
Hello, Mr. Mouri?

21
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,810
Didn't I already tell you that today I'm...

22
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,210
Yes, I guess it won't hurt to hear you out.

23
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,010
I'll be waiting for you.

24
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,510
Come on, do your job.

25
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,810
Dad!

26
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,310
I know.

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,610
What kind of person was the caller?

28
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,410
Some middle aged lady.

29
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,510
She says she's coming over right now.

30
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,710
I'll bet she is one of those,

31
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,110
"Please, please help me find my first love," type client anyway.

32
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,610
I just know it.

33
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,110
Please come in!

34
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,410
I called just a while ago. My name is Ikenami.

35
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,910
Please forgive me for intruding on you so suddenly like this.

36
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,510
"Shizuka Ikenami" -An acquaintance of mine mentioned that you, Mr. Mouri

37
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,210
"Client" -would definitely find the person that I'm looking for.

38
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,210
Please help me.

39
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,110
Please come this way.

40
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,410
Talk about beautiful.

41
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,110
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,910
Where did dad go?

43
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,810
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, mademoiselle.

44
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,110
I was looking through some papers of a very difficult case, you see.

45
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,910
Come now, and relax on the sofa,

46
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,610
and calm that pulsating heart of yours

47
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,510
before I hear you out.

48
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,410
Ran. Get us something to drink.

49
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,310
Okay.

50
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,910
Here he goes again.

51
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,910
"Mouri Detective Agency"

52
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,210
You're looking for a Jr. High School classmate?

53
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,510
Yes, we belonged to the same kendo club.

54
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,810
Couldn't you find his address on the graduation list?

55
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,910
He moved before graduation,

56
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,010
and the space where his name is supposed to be is blank.

57
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,010
He... I see...

58
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,810
I've brought a picture of him back in those days with me here.

59
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,410
He's the one in the center holding the winner's cup.

60
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,510
His name is Shiro Shibata.

61
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,210
Isn't the girl standing next to him?

62
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,610
How embarrassing, but it's me.

63
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,810
It's already been 30 years though.

64
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,710
Thirty years ago?

65
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,010
Don't tell me that you're already over 40?

66
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,910
Yes, I will be 42 this year.

67
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,910
But, the boy in the picture is still in 8th grade.

68
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,010
Although I think he may have grown taller by now.

69
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,010
Any hobbies?

70
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,410
Oh, yes... I don't think he has any special hobbies though.

71
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,310
No, I mean yours.

72
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:35,110
I like knitting, and I usually knit sweaters.

73
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,710
My, what a nice hobby.

74
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,610
Oh, my mother's hobby is knitting too.

75
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,710
My.

76
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,410
I'll bet you're good at cooking too?

77
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,210
No, not at all.

78
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,210
See, I cut myself in three places

79
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,410
when I tried to cook after a long while last night.

80
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,910
Oh well, no big deal.

81
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,710
Shortcomings help make a person more attractive at times.

82
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,810
Right, right, just like mother.

83
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,210
But I'm full of shortcomings.

84
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,410
That's why I'm still single at this age.

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,710
-What? You're single? -Yes.

86
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,510
Well, to leave a beauty like you single,

87
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,610
the guys around you must be blind.

88
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,010
Really, what a fantastic person.

89
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,410
Just like mother,

90
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,310
it's hard to understand the guy who doesn't give a hoot about her.

91
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,510
Ran.

92
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,510
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,510
What's wrong? Do you have a cold?

94
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,010
Oh, no... I was born with bronchial problems.

95
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,210
I'm allergic to dust.

96
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,910
I'm sorry,

97
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,410
it must be dusty here because we were cleaning till just a while ago.

98
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,210
Let's change places then.

99
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,110
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,510
"Cafe Poirot"

101
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,010
Picture?

102
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,910
So, you're looking for this Mr. Shibata

103
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,210
because you want to get a picture back from him?

104
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,310
Yes.

105
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,710
It's only one picture that was taken

106
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,410
when we won the semi-finals in a summer contest

107
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,410
during our Jr. High School days.

108
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,610
Just the other day,

109
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,810
my grandmother seems to have mistakenly thrown away

110
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,010
the plate we received then.

111
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,410
So, I thought that I'd like to at least have a picture of it.

112
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,110
But, why does Mr. Shibata have that picture?

113
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,810
I was using that picture

114
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,110
as a bookmarker for a book that I borrowed from him,

115
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,510
but I forgot to take the picture out of the book when I returned it to him.

116
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,910
Then, Mr. Shibata is not your first love or anything like that?

117
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,710
No... well...

118
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,510
And, do you have any other clues on him?

119
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,310
Well...

120
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,010
Mr. Mouri, may I take your order?

121
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,210
Coffee for me.

122
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,810
I'll have iced lemon tea.

123
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,310
I...

124
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,410
Reiko.

125
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,110
Reiko? Who is she?

126
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,710
Oh no... he used to call me by that name.

127
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,910
Something about the character called Reiko,

128
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,410
in the book that I borrowed from him resembled me.

129
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,410
What would you like, Conan?

130
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,910
Ice coffee for me.

131
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,010
I'll take the same.

132
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,310
All right.

133
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,610
So, where should I start.

134
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,010
The only clues I have are his name,

135
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,210
age and this picture of 30 years ago.

136
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:35,010
-You know what... -Then, what about asking him for help?

137
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,110
Him?

138
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,710
I've heard rumors about him.

139
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,710
Also that the high school detective,

140
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,710
Shinichi Kudo is in and out of your office at times.

141
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,210
Shinichi?

142
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,010
Isn't that right, son?

143
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,610
No, he hasn't come around at all that brat.

144
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,910
He only rings me up once in a while to say stupid things.

145
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,210
Well, I'm sorry that I only have stupid things to say.

146
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,210
What a bummer

147
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,510
to have such rumors going around.

148
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,410
If worse comes to worse, they may hear about it too.

149
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,110
I'll have to keep my deductions to myself for a while, I guess...

150
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,210
Conan.

151
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,310
What do you think, Conan?

152
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,810
Well, you were about to say something just now, weren't you?

153
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,910
What good is it going to do, asking a brat?

154
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,810
But, he always takes note of interesting things, doesn't he?

155
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,010
Oh, no, it's nothing.

156
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,810
Something just happened to cross my mind.

157
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,910
Since he's holding the trophy,

158
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,210
this man won the tournament, right?

159
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,310
Yes.

160
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,110
If he was that strong when he was in the 8th grade,

161
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,810
I just thought even now...

162
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,110
he must be participating in some tournament.

163
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,810
Oh, but I just thought maybe...

164
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,410
What? He's participating?

165
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,110
In the Shizuoka Tournament,

166
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,710
among the general contestants, Mr. Shiro Shibata?

167
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,810
Yes. Yes!

168
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,510
Did you find him?

169
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,010
Yeah. He seems to be a regular who always appears in the top ranks.

170
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,110
He seems to be working as a high school P.E. teacher in Shizuoka.

171
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,410
And is presently residing with his wife in a condominium.

172
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,510
I'll go rent a car right now.

173
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,810
I'm glad you found him.

174
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,710
Yes, really.

175
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,110
He's been found.

176
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,610
The one she's looking for has been found, but...

177
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,210
what I can't make out is this lady who is full of lies.

178
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,310
Almost everything she says is a lie.

179
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,710
I wonder what she is up to.

180
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,010
Could it be that she's hiding her identity?

181
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,810
Hey, hey, come on.

182
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,410
Don't tell me that this lady is...

183
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,810
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

184
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,510
"Shibata"

185
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,910
Nobody seems to be home.

186
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,010
I'm sure the couple has gone out together,

187
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,910
because today is Sunday.

188
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,110
Why don't we go kill time somewhere nearby, then?

189
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,210
Wait.

190
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,110
"Takezo Yoshikawa (47)" -Are you by chance...

191
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,210
"Shiro Shibata's friend" -looking for Mr. Shibata?

192
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,210
Yes, sort of.

193
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,810
Please finish what you have to do as soon as possible,

194
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,710
because he promised to play mahjong together today at my house.

195
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,210
But he doesn't seem to be in.

196
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,310
It can't be.

197
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,110
I'm sure he's asleep or something.

198
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,510
See, he's home.

199
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,810
This program is brought to you

200
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,410
-by the following companies. -It's the sound of the TV.

201
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,910
Come on, dozing off with the TV on without even locking the door.

202
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,310
Hey, Shibata!

203
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,010
We're going to start pretty soon!

204
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,910
Hey, hey, it looks like he was still eating?

205
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,110
The soup is cold...

206
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,610
The rice is all dried up and hard.

207
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,810
This couldn't be his breakfast.

208
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,810
What a waste, the "guji" looks so good.

209
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,610
Guji?

210
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,410
I mean tilefish.

211
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,010
I'm back. Dear?

212
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,510
Hey, who are all of you?

213
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,210
"Kyoko Shibara (38), Mrs. Shibata" -Why are you in my house?

214
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,210
I'm going to call the police.

215
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,510
-Well, you see... -We are...

216
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,310
Hey, Shibata? What's the matter?

217
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,710
Get a hold of yourself. Hey.

218
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,410
What's happened to you?

219
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,110
Mr. Shibata!

220
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,010
Mr. Shibata, get a hold of yourself.

221
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,910
Mr. Shibata!

222
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,810
He is holding something in his right hand?

223
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,210
What is it?

224
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,310
This is...

225
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,220
So, let me verify what you said.

226
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,420
Mr. Mouri and his party came over to Mr. Shibata's house

227
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,920
and pushed the button of the interphone,

228
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,820
but there was no answer.

229
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,020
Just then, Mr. Yoshikawa who had a previous engagement with came along

230
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,520
and tried turning the knob of the door.

231
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,120
The door was unlocked,

232
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,520
so the five of you came into the room.

233
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Then, Mrs. Shibata, Mr. Shibata's wife,

234
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,620
who had been out comes back

235
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,920
and runs into Mr. Mouri and the others.

236
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,020
After that, upon hearing Mr. Yoshikawa shout,

237
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,520
you all go to the living room to check things out

238
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,920
and found Mr. Shibata bleeding from the head and dead.

239
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,420
Yeah.

240
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,320
The estimated time of death is between dawn and morning today.

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,420
All right.

242
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,120
Where were you around that time, Mrs. Shibata?

243
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,220
Yes.

244
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,520
I had a golf date with a friend of mine today,

245
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,620
and my friend came to pick me up.

246
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,520
So, I prepared my husband's lunch,

247
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,820
and left the house before 05:00 am.

248
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,720
Was Mr. Shibata at home then?

249
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,620
Yes, he came home about 03:00 am and was fast asleep.

250
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,020
He came home at 03:00 am?

251
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,220
Yes.

252
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,020
We were playing mahjong.

253
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
We were playing mahjong at my room

254
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,720
that is on the fourth floor.

255
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,120
Just as Mrs. Shibata says,

256
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,620
we finished the game around 03:00 am.

257
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,620
As a matter of fact, the morning paper was one the table,

258
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,420
about what time is the newspaper delivered?

259
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,420
It comes about 06:00 am

260
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,620
and is put inside the mailbox right outside the front door.

261
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,820
I see, which means that Mr. Shibata,

262
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,720
got up in the morning,

263
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,020
pulled the newspaper out of the mailbox,

264
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,320
and was in the middle of eating his breakfast,

265
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
when someone who came to the door killed him.

266
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,020
I guess that's what happened.

267
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,420
How can you tell that it was when he was eating?

268
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,320
The food on the table is half eaten,

269
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
and besides, it's cold and dried up.

270
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,620
Who did this? Who killed my husband?

271
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,820
Well, I don't know yet.

272
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,220
Mr. Mouri, did you notice anything strange when you entered the room?

273
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,720
Well, I guess the only thing is that the TV in the kitchen was on.

274
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,520
What, the TV?

275
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,620
It was turned off when we got here.

276
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,620
I turned it off because it was noisy.

277
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,420
Besides, I just figured that he was watching TV while eating breakfast.

278
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,520
My husband could've been watching

279
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,720
a samurai show called "Kenyuden" that starts at 08:00 am.

280
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,420
My husband records that program every week

281
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,020
and watches it in the living room.

282
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,020
He sure does have a lot of them.

283
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,720
Okay, go check out the video deck in the kitchen.

284
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,420
Yes, sir.

285
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,720
Why is the LD player gone?

286
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,020
Because he has a lot of LD software

287
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,620
and yet there is no player.

288
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,820
See, this place here on the shelf is empty.

289
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,420
Moreover, there is only one speaker.

290
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,320
True.

291
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,920
Maybe it's out for repair or something, right Mrs. Shibata?

292
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,720
As to that, my husband...

293
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,820
Who cares about that right now?

294
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,320
Hurry up and do what you have to and let me go.

295
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
All right, I'm going to verify your alibi

296
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,020
so could you give me the phone number of your friend

297
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,920
-who you went golfing with? -Sure.

298
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,220
And, I'd like to have the phone numbers of the people

299
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,720
-who play mahjong with you too. -Okay.

300
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,720
She came to pick Mrs. Shibata up at 05:00 am sharp?

301
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,820
Are you sure?

302
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,020
Yes, she says the radio beeped the time at the tone.

303
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,120
And, she says she dropped Mrs. Shibata off here

304
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,520
a little after 07:00 pm.

305
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,920
A little after 07:00 pm is just about the time we got here.

306
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,220
I also check with the newspaper man,

307
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,720
and he said that he delivered the papers here around 06:00 am.

308
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,020
Taking into consideration that the samurai program this morning

309
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,420
was kept recording on the video and the time the program was aired,

310
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,820
the estimated time of the crime

311
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,620
would probably be around 08:00 am to 45 minutes from then.

312
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,420
Which means that Mrs. Shibata couldn't have done it.

313
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,920
No.

314
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,620
Of course not.

315
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,620
Then, let me ask you this, Mr. Yoshikawa,

316
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,020
I've had my doubts about the way you've been acting till now,

317
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,120
but would you tell me your alibi around 08:00 am this morning?

318
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,220
At home sleeping.

319
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,620
Is there anyone who can verify that?

320
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,820
No, because I live alone.

321
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,120
That's right. I left a message on the answering phone.

322
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,320
I said, "About time you get up, because I'm going to pick you up soon."

323
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,520
A killer wouldn't leave such a message behind, would he?

324
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,520
Or, maybe that's the very reason you left the message?

325
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,620
Wait a minute,

326
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,520
you seem to be suspecting only me but, what about them?

327
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Although they seem to be an acquaintance of yours or something.

328
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,520
They would never commit a murder.

329
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,420
He is Kogoro Mouri, a detective that I deeply respect.

330
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Thank you.

331
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
You mean that famous...

332
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,520
-Sleeping Kogoro! -That's right.

333
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,520
The young lady with him is his daughter Ran.

334
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,820
The little one is staying at his place, and his name is Conan.

335
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,620
And, this beautiful woman here is Mrs. Mouri.

336
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,420
Right, Mr. Mouri?

337
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,020
-Does it look that way? -No way.

338
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,720
My name is Ikenami, and I went over to Mr. Mouri's office

339
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,520
to have him look for Mr. Shiro Shibata

340
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
who happened to be an old friend of mine.

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,720
I came here because I wanted him to give me back a picture

342
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,820
that I had mistakenly given to him about 30 years ago.

343
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
A picture?

344
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,720
That picture is probably the picture that he's holding in his hand.

345
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Hey.

346
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,520
I took a look at it a while ago.

347
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,120
It can't be...

348
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,920
This is...

349
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,020
Don't tell me that this is...

350
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,520
Yes, that's the picture.

351
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,120
That's the picture I was looking for.

352
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,420
Why is Mr. Shibata holding the picture in his hand?

353
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,320
Maybe, Mr. Mouri...

354
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,720
This is his dying message?

355
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
It can't be.

356
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,420
Beautiful Shizuka can't possibly be involved in any way.

357
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Besides, this picture was to have been kept between the pages of a book.

358
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,220
I can't believe that it just happened to conveniently be on the floor

359
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,720
where he was struck to death.

360
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,920
Something is squashed under the stomach of that man.

361
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,420
This is?

362
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,620
A novel?

363
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,120
The title is "The Gate of the God of Thunder".

364
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,020
Don't tell me that this is the book you were talking about?

365
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,820
Yes, it is.

366
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,820
That's the book that I borrowed from Shiro 30 years ago, and read,

367
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,620
using that picture as a bookmarker.

368
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,420
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

369
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,720
Hey hold it, will you?

370
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Don't you think everything fits in too well?

371
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
How can it be that the book as well as the picture

372
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,420
just happened to be lying on the floor, so coincidentally?

373
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,620
Come to think of it,

374
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,020
there was a strange phone call the day before yesterday.

375
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
A strange phone call?

376
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,120
Well, Mr. Shibata said,

377
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,720
"Watch the program because it's interesting."

378
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,420
That's why I was watching that samurai movie here in this living room.

379
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,920
Just then, I got a phone call.

380
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,120
Right, Mrs. Shibata?

381
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,020
Yes, the person on the phone asked my husband something.

382
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,120
He searched for a book, took it from the shelf,

383
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
flipped through the pages and grinned while remarking,

384
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,420
"I found it, I found it."

385
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,720
He grinned? And? Where did your husband put that book after that?

386
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm sure that he put in on top of the books

387
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,620
that he had piled up in front of the bookshelf.

388
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,320
They are scattered.

389
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,620
Officer Yokomizo.

390
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,720
Although they are very slight, there are blood stains in the corridor.

391
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
What?

392
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,020
It seems as though

393
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,320
the real scene of the crime was here in the corridor.

394
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,420
Officer.

395
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,620
Could I take a look at that book?

396
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,420
No, no because it's a very important piece of evidence.

397
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,320
Besides, this is a ninja book full of kanji characters.

398
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,120
You're too young to be reading something like this.

399
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,520
Did you read the book, officer?

400
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,320
Yeah, a long time ago.

401
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Does a person by the name of Reiko come out in that book?

402
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,620
A lady with such a fancy name doesn't appear anywhere in the book.

403
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,220
Not again.

404
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,420
Yet another one.

405
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,220
She's lied again.

406
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,420
What on earth is she up to anyway?

407
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,520
What is there behind all the lies of hers?

408
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,360
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,220
"Bandage"

410
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,180
-Next time will show Part 2. -Hey, Conan, her true identity is...

411
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:42,040
-What? -What?
