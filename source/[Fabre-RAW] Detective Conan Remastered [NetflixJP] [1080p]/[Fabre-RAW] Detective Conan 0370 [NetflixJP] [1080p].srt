1
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,135
The members of the Youth Detective Squad are today's hero.

2
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:26,635
A boisterous racket breaks out.

3
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:28,035
Right before the game soft appears on the market.

4
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:29,635
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:31,335
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,335
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,620
Hey! It's there!

8
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,820
Look!

9
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
So that's where "Gadlin One" was made, isn't it?

10
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
It's amazing!

11
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,320
Yeah, I know!

12
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,820
It's so cool!

13
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,920
I really can't wait.

14
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,020
So, is that it?

15
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,320
Is that the TV game you all got hooked on?

16
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,520
That's...

17
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,820
-"Gadlin"! -"Gadlin"!

18
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,120
And this is where the awesome game is being made!

19
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,620
The Shining!

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,220
How can you forget, Conan?

21
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,220
"Gadlin" is a million-seller TV game, you know?

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,920
This is episode one!

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
I think you are the only one

24
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,320
who doesn't know about this TV game.

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,020
I don't really care.

26
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,220
Episode two is finally coming out next week!

27
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,120
There were seven mysteries left unsolved in episode one,

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,220
but everything is gonna to be solved in the second one.

29
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,320
I really can't wait!

30
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,620
What's waiting at the end!

31
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,620
Gadlin! Please, tell me!

32
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,520
Hey!

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,220
Where do you guys think you're going?

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,620
"Fugitive TV Game"

35
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,120
Can I help you?

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,020
What? Yes.

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,020
Actually...

38
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,620
Could you do us a favor?

39
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,120
Could you tell us the seven mysteries in "Gadlin Two", please?

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,320
You don't have to tell us everything. Just a little!

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,520
Please?

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,120
"Yukari Hachisuka (25)" -No. I cannot do that.

43
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,820
Okay, then, what about a hint?

44
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Please?

45
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,220
You have to wait until it comes out,

47
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,220
Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School!

48
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,420
Do you know my name?

49
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,020
Yes. Of course!

50
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,520
You are famous.

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,820
That's not so true.

52
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,220
You got your name tag on your backpack.

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
What?

54
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,620
I see.

55
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,220
I need to go!

56
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,120
I need to go to washroom.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
What? Washroom?

58
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
Oh, please, Genta!

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,420
I really can't hold it! I'm in danger!

60
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm going to use your washroom, okay?

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Kid!

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
-Hey! -Genta!

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,820
This is bad... I need to hurry!

64
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Oh my god. Where is it?

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,620
Hey, what are you doing here?

66
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,420
You can't come up here!

67
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,920
Wait, I'm going to pee in my pants!

68
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,020
Let me use your washroom, please!

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,520
Genta!

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,820
Hey, you! Wait!

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,420
Don't talk to me...

72
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,120
-Hey! -Where is it?

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,420
-Wait! -Hey!

74
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm going to pee in my pants if I keep running.

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
Wait!

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,420
Oh no! Don't tell me it's a dead end!

77
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,520
Come on, hurry up!

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,420
Washroom... Is it this way?

79
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,720
Kids, where are you!

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
-Let's go, guys! -Is it okay here?

81
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,420
Which floor is the washroom?

82
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
"This Month's Topic: Nobukazu Michiba"

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,220
Come in.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,220
President Michiba!

85
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,120
The subscription sales of "Gadlin Two" have gone over two hundred thousand!

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
"Nobukazu Michiba (36)" -It's gonna be a huge hit.

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Even bigger than the first one!

88
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,120
Of course.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
For "Gadlin Two",

90
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,920
I worked as hard as I could.

91
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,120
It have to be a huge hit.

92
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,420
Nobukazu Michiba, a genius game producer.

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,520
You're the superstar of the gaming world.

94
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,720
You're also a genius scenario writer.

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,120
Well, let's do the final check.

96
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,220
You can never be too sure, right?

97
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,420
See you later.

98
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
Michiba!

99
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
"Gadlin One" and "Gadlin Two", both of it was my idea.

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,620
"Shinji Kobayashi (36)" -It was what I wrote when I was in college!

101
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,220
It was all in my notebook!

102
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,320
And you just stole them all without my permission!

103
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,720
So what are you trying to say?

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm going to tell the media that you stole my idea!

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,620
See you in court!

106
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,920
Darn it!

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,420
-What are you doing? -You think I'll let you do that, you jerk?

108
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,820
Kobayashi was murdered...

109
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,620
two nights ago in this room.

110
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Who are you?

111
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Me?

112
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm a detective hired by Kobayashi.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,420
Kobayashi had been searching for evidence of plagiarism.

114
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,120
It will be quite useful in court.

115
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,620
So for his evidence searching,

116
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,820
I was hired to spy on you with a hidden camera.

117
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,020
It was worth doing it.

118
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,220
With two hundred million yen, you can buy this disk.

119
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,820
What are you talking about?

120
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,120
Hey! Stay right there!

121
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Sorry, I just don't wanna be shot like Kobayashi.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,320
Oh, yeah, before I forget...

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,420
If anything happens to me,

124
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,920
the master tape of this movie will be played in public, just so you know.

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,220
Now again, it's two hundred million yen.

126
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,520
You earned tons and tons of money with "Gadlin One".

127
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,420
This much money is nothing to you, right?

128
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,520
But remember, I'm not here to negotiate with you!

129
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,820
I got it.

130
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,120
Yeah, that's my friend.

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,620
Mr. President.

132
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,520
Who would?

133
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,020
What are you doing?

134
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,720
What are you trying to do?

135
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,020
Where did they go?

136
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,720
He's gone.

137
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,820
Hey, where's Genta?

138
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,420
Where is the master tape?

139
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,520
Say it!

140
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,620
Or you want to die, right now?

141
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,020
Now I'm back!

142
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,320
It was close though...

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,220
What... Where is this?

144
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,720
Looks so nice. Whose room is this?

145
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,220
A TV game?

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,920
"Gadlin Two"?

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,320
No way!

148
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,220
It's "Gadlin Two"!

149
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,520
Genta!

150
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,020
Where were you?

151
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,220
We were worried about you!

152
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,720
The guard is still looking for us. He's mad.

153
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Look what you did!

154
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,720
We got to get out of here right now!

155
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,520
Come on, Genta! Hurry up!

156
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,620
Kids?

157
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,320
-I'm sorry! -Hey, wait!

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,820
It's nothing! Kids, stop!

159
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
There you are!

160
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,420
Go that way!

161
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,120
Mr. Michiba!

162
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,920
Get them, go! They stole "Gadlin Two"!

163
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,020
What?

164
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,220
Take the stairs! I'll be coming too!

165
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,320
Yes, sir!

166
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm over if that disk goes public!

167
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,220
Hurry up...

168
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,520
-Conan! -Hurry...

169
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,420
Now, hurry!

170
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,720
Hey!

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,420
Wait!

172
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,520
Where did they go?

173
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,820
Outside! They went outside!

174
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,020
Okay!

175
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
A gun? What's going on?

176
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,620
All right.

177
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm so sorry!

178
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,020
What are you doing here? Is that your friend?

179
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,420
-What? -Forget it!

180
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,620
Get out of here!

181
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm sorry. I couldn't catch them.

182
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,220
What?

183
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,120
They all had a bike.

184
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,420
I could never imagine kids sneaking into a huge building

185
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,820
and stealing things!

186
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,120
You got to be kidding!

187
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,220
Who are they?

188
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,520
Sorry.

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,220
He is...

190
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,020
I remember his name is Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School.

191
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,820
Teitan Primary School.

192
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,120
Genta Kojima?

193
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Should I call the police?

194
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,520
No, don't! I'll go!

195
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,020
You guys go back to work!

196
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,420
Yes, sir.

197
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,520
Those kids think that the disk is "Gadlin Two".

198
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,720
They'll play it as soon as they get home!

199
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,620
I must prevent it or else, we are over!

200
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,520
Search the address of Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School!

201
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
Now I see what is happening.

202
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,320
When you get the info, go to his house before him, got it, Bee?

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,820
Bee? Is that the name of his partner?

204
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,120
For kids, it would take 30 minutes to get to Beika-cho.

205
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,220
If they don't come home within 30 minutes, then.

206
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,320
Darn!

207
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,720
What bad timing!

208
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,620
The bug is broken!

209
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,320
This is bad. They are in danger!

210
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,020
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

211
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,220
Ayumi!

212
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,075
Beika. Beika.

213
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:15,675
Please do not forget your belongings when leaving the train.

214
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:16,975
Hurry!

215
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:20,675
Here!

216
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,075
"No entry for cars"

217
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,475
What are we gonna do?

218
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:34,175
Those guys looked mad.

219
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:38,075
I just used the washroom. What's wrong with that?

220
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:40,875
I'm so hungry since we ran so hard.

221
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:46,075
This happened because you went inside the building all of a sudden!

222
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,375
Did you know that?

223
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,575
What the...

224
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,475
What? What is it, Genta?

225
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:54,675
Actually...

226
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:55,775
What?

227
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,675
I got something in my bag.

228
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,575
This is...

229
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:03,275
-"Gadlin Two", isn't it? -"Gadlin Two"! No way!

230
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,175
It's real!

231
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:10,775
Although this is the dummy version, it's the real "Gadlin Two"!

232
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:14,575
Yeah, I know.

233
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:18,175
But Genta, how did you get this?

234
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:22,575
Well, actually it was just inside my backpack.

235
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:25,275
In your backpack, you said?

236
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:28,475
How? How did I get this?

237
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,175
It's the fancy room!

238
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:36,075
No wonder they were trying so hard to catch us.

239
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,675
Hold it! Hey!

240
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:40,075
I see. So this is the reason why.

241
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:43,475
Genta! We are in a pretty serious situation right now.

242
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:44,675
That's right.

243
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,375
Although it wasn't intentional, this is still stealing.

244
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,575
Plus, the game is not in store yet.

245
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:54,375
Stealing? Me?

246
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,475
This is why we're being chased.

247
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,075
"If you have seen this boy, call 110"

248
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,975
Finally, the suspect, a primary school boy,

249
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:09,275
Genta Kojima, has been arrested by the police!

250
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,775
According to the police,

251
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,675
it's been found that the suspect is involved in many other crimes

252
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:14,275
besides the stolen "Gadlin Two" case.

253
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:18,575
-Genta! -Genta!

254
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:20,275
Genta Kojima!

255
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,375
We've got all the evidence already!

256
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,575
You're the one who broke the headmaster's vase, aren't you?

257
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,575
Me?

258
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,375
I know you didn't do your homework three days in a row

259
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,375
and also skipped your cleanup duty.

260
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,575
We've got a witness saying that you didn't wash your hands

261
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,675
before eating your lunch!

262
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,675
What are you? A beast?

263
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:42,075
Have you forgot your own language!

264
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,175
We know you did it!

265
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,075
Come on, spit it all out!

266
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,375
Genta Kojima!

267
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,075
I'm sorry!

268
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,375
I think you should turn yourself in, Genta!

269
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:05,075
But before that, I want to eat grilled eel.

270
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:08,675
My mom told me that we're having grilled eel for dinner!

271
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:10,275
It's not too late yet, right?

272
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,475
What the...

273
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,375
It's been an hour already.

274
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,675
Those people from The Shining must think that

275
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,675
the kids have seen what's in the disk.

276
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,975
They're seriously in danger!

277
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:26,275
They're back!

278
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,175
Hey!

279
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,675
What the...

280
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,675
Everyone! Move! Move!

281
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:52,675
Oh no!

282
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,275
It hurts...

283
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:04,675
That guy is seriously mad!

284
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:07,475
-Let's go! -Ayumi! Hurry up!

285
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,875
Wait!

286
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,275
Take this!

287
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:44,175
Hey! Wake up!

288
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:47,675
Take that gun and kill them, Bee!

289
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:50,275
Go, now!

290
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:53,175
That was his partner, Bee.

291
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:56,475
Bee has a gun and is chasing Genta and the rest now.

292
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,275
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

293
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,375
Ayumi!

294
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,675
Where are you all?

295
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,775
It's possible that they went there.

296
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,575
Hurry, Genta!

297
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,975
I'm starving. I can't walk anymore.

298
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:19,175
Be a man! You're the one who caused this trouble!

299
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:25,275
Let's just go and put the game back.

300
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,175
And apologize.

301
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,275
Let's go!

302
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,075
No one's here.

303
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,075
It was here.

304
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,075
Then, put it there.

305
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:46,875
Okay? Three, two, one.

306
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,075
-I'm sorry! -I'm sorry.

307
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:51,575
I hope our apology is accepted.

308
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,275
I hope so too.

309
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,475
Genta!

310
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:55,775
Hey!

311
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:58,875
Can we watch "Gadlin Two" just a little, before we go?

312
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,775
Oh, no!

313
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,975
Don't!

314
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,475
What are you doing?

315
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,575
Only the seven mysteries.

316
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,575
Just a little.

317
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:11,175
-The seven mysteries? -The seven mysteries?

318
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,475
Just a little, yeah?

319
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:27,675
Michiba!

320
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:30,675
"Gadlin One" and "Gadlin Two", both of it was my idea.

321
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,275
What is this?

322
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,775
See you in court!

323
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:38,075
You think I'll let you do that, you jerk?

324
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,375
What are you doing, Michiba?

325
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,375
You jerk!

326
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,375
You stole my "Gadlin"!

327
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,275
Now you're stabbing me in the back!

328
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:47,875
Just because you can't beat me! Michiba,

329
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,275
you haven't changed at all since you were in college.

330
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,575
Shut up!

331
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:56,875
How hard do you think I worked on creating this software?

332
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:02,975
No way! You're better than this, Michiba!

333
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:03,975
-No way! -No way!

334
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:06,875
It... It's the woman that was at the front desk!

335
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,975
Yes, it was me.

336
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:12,075
-What? -What?

337
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:16,375
You saw what's in the disk.

338
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,275
Now I have to kill you all.

339
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:23,675
No. Please, don't!

340
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:27,275
No! I have to eat mom's grilled eel.

341
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:31,475
Really? That's too bad, Genta Kojima.

342
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,375
As I suspected, it was you.

343
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,775
Yukari Hachisuka.

344
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,375
Conan!

345
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,375
-Conan! -Conan!

346
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,375
When Michiba called his partner "B", it dawned on me that

347
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,375
"B" stood for "Bee", an insect.

348
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,475
In Japanese, bee is "hachi"?

349
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:56,975
Hachisuka.

350
00:20:56,975 --> 00:21:00,575
Your last name has also the word "hachi" in it,

351
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:03,975
so I concluded that Bee was your code name.

352
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,775
I guess you are in a relationship with Michiba, aren't you?

353
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:11,675
Yes. We are gonna get married soon.

354
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:14,275
And in order to protect our promised future,

355
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,075
I would do anything!

356
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,775
Anything, literally.

357
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,775
Conan!

358
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,275
Miss! Please, don't!

359
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,475
Did you know?

360
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:26,675
That all this conversation is being recorded by the police.

361
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:28,975
Cell phone!

362
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,475
Yukari Hachisuka!

363
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:38,975
You're under arrest for attempted murder!

364
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,775
It's game over, isn't it?

365
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:46,975
Thus, Yukari Hachisuka and President Michiba were arrested.

366
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:49,375
The blackmail detective was found alive.

367
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,275
Also, the kids seemed to have learned that

368
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:57,475
their stupidity had caused a lot of trouble.

369
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,875
If I didn't go to the washroom,

370
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,075

371
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:34,675
Yeah, you are right!

372
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,875
Good job, Genta!

373
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,275
You're the man, Genta!

374
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,975
We are gonna fight the evils.

375
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,775
We are the ones to save this town!

376
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:48,375
-Yeah! -Yeah!

377
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,475
-Victory for The Youth Detective Squad!

378
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:56,275
Hey! Haven't they learned the lesson!

379
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:57,775
Oh, shoots!

380
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:33,802
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:36,302
"Tennis ball"

382
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,102
-Next week is the Athens Olympics! -Let's go, Japan!

383
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,802
-The week after next, we will be in Okinawa! -That's not fair!
