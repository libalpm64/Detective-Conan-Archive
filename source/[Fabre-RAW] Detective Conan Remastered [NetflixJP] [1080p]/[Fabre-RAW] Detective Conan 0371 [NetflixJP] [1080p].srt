1
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,880
Today, an out of the ordinary talk show

2
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,280
between a baseball player and Pops in Okinawa

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,480
turns into a murder case.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,880
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:04,258
"9:33 am, Okinawa (Naha)"

8
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,558
You haven't changed, have you, Nose?

9
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,058
The way you tilt your neck to the right when you run.

10
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:19,058
That habit of yours.

11
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,358
Motoyama.

12
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,558
What brings you here?

13
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,658
It's only just past 9:30 am?

14
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,658
I told you over the phone last night, didn't I?

15
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:29,258
That I'd fly over if for you.

16
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,158
Like Hideyoshi would.

17
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:44,158
"The Silent Route (Part 1)"

18
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:47,158
"Half day ago, 6:29 pm, Tokyo" -What? We're going to Okinawa tomorrow?

19
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,258
You didn't tell me about it at all!

20
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,458
Didn't I tell you about it?

21
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,658
You know him, don't you?

22
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:53,658
The King of Save,

23
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:56,658
Toshizou Nose of the professional baseball team, Jaguars!

24
00:02:56,658 --> 00:03:01,658
Nichiuri TV has asked me to have a chat session with him!

25
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,858
But I wonder why they chose you, Pops?

26
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,558
A professional baseball player and detective

27
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:08,058
don't seem to have much in common.

28
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,058
Are you dumb or what?

29
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,858
Nose is known as the brain pitcher player of the baseball world!

30
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:18,458
It's his sharp-eye of discerning the habits

31
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,458
and type of ball the batter will hit against my power of deduction!

32
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,558
Are you sure you can handle it?

33
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:29,658
I hear that Mr. Nose is a very difficult person to deal with.

34
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,058
Don't worry!

35
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,458
I hear that this sport reporter who is on good terms with Nose

36
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,658
-will join in on our conversation too. -Thank you very much.

37
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,458
So, that was Mr. Kigure training here in Miyazaki!

38
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,358
He seems to be all out to get a straight victory for the Falcons!

39
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,558
Thank you very much.

40
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,558
Then, Mr. Motoyama,

41
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:49,258
you're scheduled for a talk show with Mr. Nose tomorrow in Okinawa,

42
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:51,558
I hope that it'll be as interesting as today.

43
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:54,758
I'll be fine! Nose is my best friend

44
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:57,158
and besides, a famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

45
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,158
will pitch in to help me tomorrow too!

46
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,158
See!

47
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,458
What time is your flight tomorrow?

48
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:07,458
I think it's departing at 6:35 am from Haneda Airport tomorrow

49
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,858
because Nose's seems to only be free in the morning.

50
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:15,858
What? Which means we have to get up before 5 am?

51
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:20,158
Then, we'll have to get ready and hit the sack early today too, Conan!

52
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,558
Okay!

53
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,658
Hey... I'm going alone.

54
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:26,558
Right, let's run over to the convenience store now

55
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,758
and pick up stuff that we need!

56
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,658
Okay! Let's go!

57
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:33,158
We've to hurry because we don't have time!

58
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:35,458
I tell you, Dad, you should've told us earlier.

59
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,758
He's being mean, isn't he?

60
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:42,858
"Same day, 7:20 pm, Miyazaki"

61
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,658
Hi, Nose! Did you watch the program?

62
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,358
My corner that was aired a while ago.

63
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,958
"Masaharu Motoyama" -Yeah. You mean the sports program on Nichiuri TV

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,858
that's aired at around 6:30 pm?

65
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:56,058
Right.

66
00:04:56,058 --> 00:05:00,358
"At the same time, Okinawa" -Sorry. I was out eating and missed it.

67
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,558
"Toshizou Nose" -I'm going out drinking with some young players

68
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:04,558
who are training here with me now.

69
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:05,958
Did you want anything?

70
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,158
No. All I wanted to say was see you at the talk show tomorrow.

71
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:12,458
Same here and help me out

72
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:16,258
if the Detective Kogoro Mouri digs in too deep, will you?

73
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:17,858
By the way, Motoyama.

74
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,258
Don't miss your flight tomorrow!

75
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:22,558
You're not that great getting up in the morning.

76
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:26,558
I'll be fine, since my flight leaves at 8:15 am.

77
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:29,358
You know I'll fly over if for you, right?

78
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,158
Just like Hideyoshi would.

79
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,758
Hideyoshi?

80
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,458
Then am I supposed to be Nobunaga or something?

81
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:42,258
It's true that I'm the one who got you that TV job after you retired

82
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,658
but I only did it because we entered the team at that same time!

83
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,958
No need to feel obligated or anything!

84
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:50,658
The young ones are here, I got to go.

85
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,158
See you tomorrow!

86
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:55,058
Yeah. Don't drink too much!

87
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:59,658
You've got the Japan record career save on your shoulder.

88
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:00,758
Yeah!

89
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,958
You, Nobunaga?

90
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,558
You're Mitsuhide.

91
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,358
"8:09 am, Flight SKJ931 (Tokyo to Okinawa)"

92
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,558
Of all things,

93
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,358
they've come along with me.

94
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:23,158
What's wrong? When you called the TV station last night,

95
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:27,258
they said they'd pay for Conan and I too, didn't they?

96
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:30,658
Thanks to you guys, my seat was ranked down to a regular seat, though.

97
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:35,658
The Okinawa food that I ate last time I went was really delicious!

98
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:40,558
My plans of having a ball over food a drinks with an Okinawan beauty.

99
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:42,058
Darn it!

100
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,158
Don't worry!

101
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,958
I'll just take pictures with my digital camera and won't get in your way.

102
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,558
Did you have a digital camera?

103
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:49,658
Yep.

104
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:56,858
Remember? The one that you won at the year-end party?

105
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,158
I'm so sorry!

106
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,758
I'm sorry!

107
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:09,458
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,958
Why did you bring tennis balls with you?

109
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,058
Well, a boy in my class that's in the baseball club,

110
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,858
who was watching the program last night,

111
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,558
asked me to get him Mr. Nose's autograph.

112
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:21,658
I told them that I didn't have the card to write autographs on,

113
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,458
then they said anything is okay.

114
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:28,858
So I brought the tennis balls that Sonoko gave me.

115
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:31,758
The ball that dad used for the community baseball game

116
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:33,358
was all soiled and dirty besides.

117
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,758
Does four balls mean there are four members in your class

118
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:37,858
that are in the baseball club?

119
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,158
There are three boys in the baseball club

120
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:43,758
and the other one is for me.

121
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:45,158
It's Eri, isn't it?

122
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,558
She used to be a Jaguar fan.

123
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:51,158
Right! So please, will you get his autograph for mother?

124
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:52,458
No way!

125
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,558
I don't want to stick a tennis ball out at a baseball player

126
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,258
and ask for his autograph.

127
00:07:58,358 --> 00:07:59,658
True.

128
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:04,158
"9:23 am, Okinawa (Naha Airport)"

129
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,058
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Mouri.

130
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:09,158
I'm Teranishi of Nichiuri TV Okinawa!

131
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,458
Hello, I'm here with my daughter!

132
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,058
Daughter? Where is she?

133
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:16,058
What?

134
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,358
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

135
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,858
I'm going to go see if they sell autograph cards!

136
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,258
I tell you.

137
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:25,758
By the way, how's the you know what?

138
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:28,358
Oh, you mean at night, right?

139
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,458
Yes, I've reserved a great place!

140
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,858
Oh! No.

141
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,358
We're canceling that!

142
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:35,458
I'm talking about the other stuff.

143
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,358
Oh. That.

144
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:42,458
I asked Mr. Motoyama who will join in on the talk show today

145
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,558
and he agreed just like that.

146
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:44,958
That's good to know!

147
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,758
And, Mr. Motoyama has already arrived here from Miyazaki?

148
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:52,058
No. He'll be on the flight arriving at 9:50 am

149
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,558
so we'll have to wait another 30 minutes.

150
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:58,258
That's the only flight there is from Miyazaki to Okinawa.

151
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:01,058
Then, shall I take my daughter and the boy

152
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:03,658
to the hotel that Mr. Nose will be staying at?

153
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:07,458
I guess so but I don't think Mr. Nose is there.

154
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,558
Why not?

155
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:14,658
He seems to routinely jogs from 9 am to 10 am in the morning.

156
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:17,258
So, I'm sure that he in the midst of...

157
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:20,458
running along a road somewhere near the hotel.

158
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,958
"9:34 am, Okinawa (Naha)"

159
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:31,358
You know about it, don't you?

160
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:33,358
The "great revenge" of Hideyoshi.

161
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:36,358
That is Mitsuhide who wanted to kill Nobunaga

162
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,358
and rule over the world.

163
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:42,158
The superhuman act of Hideyoshi, going from Okayama to Kyoto

164
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:45,558
in as little as three days to take revenge.

165
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:49,058
Nose, I hate to say this

166
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,558
but I'm not letting you get to the top.

167
00:09:56,858 --> 00:10:00,358
"9:52 am, Okinawa (Naha Airport)"

168
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:03,358
Hey, how long are you going to keep searching?

169
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,058
Mr. Motoyama's flight should be arriving soon!

170
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:09,458
Well, I can't find autograph cards anywhere!

171
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,258
Okay! I'll get autographs for your friends for you, then.

172
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:15,858
Really! You'll get mother's too then, right?

173
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:16,858
No way.

174
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,358
What's with you!

175
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:22,058
Do you know where they sell autograph cards near here?

176
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:23,258
Autograph card?

177
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:25,658
Let's see. The nearest place is...

178
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,858
-Dad! -There he is!

179
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,358
Mr. Motoyama, over here!

180
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:32,858
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

181
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:35,658
How do you do? I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri!

182
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,458
I'm Masaharu Motoyama!

183
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,058
I've heard a lot about you.

184
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:42,058
-I'm his daughter. -I'm sorry!

185
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,458
We don't have much time,

186
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,558
so let's continue the introductions in the car.

187
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,258
-All right! -Shall we get going then?

188
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,758
Okinawa sure is a nice place.

189
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:53,058
Too bad it's raining, though.

190
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:54,958
Hey! Let's go sonny!

191
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,158
Oh, okay.

192
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,458
Mr. Motoyama seems to be a kind person

193
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,358
so maybe I'll be able to ask him for Mr. Nose's autograph.

194
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,758
I guess so.

195
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,558
It seems that Nose hasn't returned to the hotel yet.

196
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:23,958
Maybe he got tired on the way back and is resting somewhere?

197
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,958
After all, he's not all that young. I mean you know...

198
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,258
That's...

199
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,458
Hey, you'll catch cold sleeping in a place like that!

200
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:40,858
That is...

201
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,558
The uniform of the Jaguars.

202
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,858
Hey, Conan!

203
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,358
Hey! Isn't he Mr. Nose?

204
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,958
-No way. -Mr. Nose?

205
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,058
This is bad!

206
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:05,458
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

207
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,058
The police?

208
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,102
Hey! Isn't he Mr. Nose?

209
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,802
-No way. -Mr. Nose?

210
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:22,702
This is bad!

211
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:26,102
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

212
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:29,402
The police?

213
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,102
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

214
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,902
Mr. Nose has been stabbed in the stomach with something

215
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,502
and is already dead.

216
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:38,502
No way.

217
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:41,502
Ran! You brought a digital camera along, didn't you?

218
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:43,202
Yes.

219
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:47,302
Let's take a picture of the scene before the police get here.

220
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:55,502
The digital camera...

221
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,602
Here it is!

222
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,202
Hey, Ran! You haven't found it yet?

223
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:13,802
Hurry it up, will you?

224
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:14,902
Okay!

225
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:20,602
First from right above,

226
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,102
take two or three pictures.

227
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,702
Be careful not go inside the grassy area.

228
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:36,402
What's wrong, Ran?

229
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,102
Well...

230
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,902
I was thinking of getting mom

231
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,502
a picture of Mr. Nose posing his signature pose.

232
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:46,902
And yet I end up taking this kind of picture.

233
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,602
Sorry, never mind already.

234
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:56,602
I'll take the pictures so you go back inside the car.

235
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:43,402
This guy's Nose of the Jaguars!

236
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:47,002
I saw on TV that he was training over here.

237
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:51,202
The estimated time of death is around 9:30 am.

238
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,402
The cause of death is loss of blood

239
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:55,302
from being stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

240
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:58,002
The weapon hasn't been found yet though.

241
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:59,902
And where is the person who found him?

242
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:02,502
I think it was...

243
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:08,402
Who is the one that found the body?

244
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:09,802
It would be us.

245
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:11,802
We coincidentally happened to drive by

246
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:15,602
and found Mr. Nose lying on the ground!

247
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:19,902
He was probably stabbed by someone while jogging.

248
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,902
If I remember correctly, you're...

249
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:23,702
Yeah. That famous detective.

250
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,302
Do you know me?

251
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,702
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

252
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,902
You're the talk of the town in Okinawa!

253
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,902
Yes...

254
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:35,202
You're highly valued for your tremendous appetite, right?

255
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,302
Yeah.

256
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:40,102
Come to think of it, when we were here before this,

257
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:42,802
Pops entered a big-eater's contest with Hattori.

258
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:47,802
So, it's almost as if the case has been solved then!

259
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:49,602
We're counting on you!

260
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:52,302
I wonder if they really believe so.

261
00:15:52,302 --> 00:15:57,302
I know somebody you can count on more than Mr. Mouri, though!

262
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,402
Sports reporter, Mr. Motoyama!

263
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:04,102
Just what are you talking about, sonny?

264
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:07,402
Because when we found Mr. Nose,

265
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,902
his blood was drained in the rain

266
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,002
and unless we went up close to take a look

267
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:15,102
we couldn't tell that he was stabbed in the stomach!

268
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:21,702
Besides, if one knew that Mr. Nose was jogging,

269
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:24,202
wouldn't it be most natural to think that Mr. Nose fell ill

270
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:25,802
and was lying on the ground?

271
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:29,802
But you said to call the police without even getting off the car.

272
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:33,702
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

273
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,602
Even Holmes can't beat you as a detective!

274
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:41,102
How did you know?

275
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:43,102
That it was murder?

276
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:50,602
Come to think of it, before I checked Mr. Nose's stomach

277
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:53,502
and mentioned him being stabbed you.

278
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:56,002
-Through a phone call! -A phone call?

279
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:57,902
After the TV appearance last night,

280
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:00,702
I called Nose from the hotel in Miyazaki,

281
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:02,602
he mentioned that.

282
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:05,202
A strange man claiming to be a Jaguars anti-fans

283
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,502
was troubling him with crank calls.

284
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,102
Well, when I saw Nose lying on the ground,

285
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:13,202
I just felt that something was wrong.

286
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:15,002
Is that true?

287
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:18,702
Well, I guess it'll do you no good to suspect me anyway,

288
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:21,802
because I couldn't have committed the crime.

289
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,002
Just what do you mean?

290
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:25,902
Because Mr. Nose's estimated time of death

291
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,302
is about 9:30 am this morning, right?

292
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:29,702
Just around that time,

293
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,302
I was on the flight that left Miyazaki at 8:15 am

294
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:37,102
and scheduled to arrive in Okinawa at 9:50 am.

295
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,502
Check the passenger's list!

296
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:39,502
Yes, sir!

297
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:44,202
My name is not on the list.

298
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:45,502
Why not?

299
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:47,102
I'm pretty well known.

300
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,502
I don't like people making a fuss

301
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:52,202
that I've always bought my tickets under an alias.

302
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,202
Besides, I was slightly disguised wearing a hat and all that,

303
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:58,402
I don't think anyone saw me.

304
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:01,102
So, what was the alias that you used?

305
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:03,902
Yamada.

306
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:06,302
No, maybe it was Tanaka?

307
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:12,102
Well, if Mr. Motoyama was in Miyazaki last night,

308
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:13,702
he has an alibi.

309
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:17,802
Because that's the only fight that flies from Miyazaki to Okinawa.

310
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:23,502
Please go ahead and ask the hotel in Miyazaki that I spent the night at.

311
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,702
Here you go.

312
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:30,302
The Miyazaki Princess Hotel, room number...

313
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,902
Is it this one?

314
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:36,402
I called Mr. Nose on my cell phone last night

315
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:39,602
so please check the outgoing calls record of that room.

316
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:41,902
Okay, hurry and check it out!

317
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:42,902
Yes, sir!

318
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,202
Okay, then everyone...

319
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:47,102
May I ask all of you to come with me to the station?

320
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:48,102
Darn it.

321
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:50,602
It was supposed to be the great chat show of all three of us.

322
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:52,102
Great chat show?

323
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:55,902
He's from Nichiuri TV of Okinawa,

324
00:18:55,902 --> 00:19:00,102
and was scheduled to have a chat with Mr. Nose today.

325
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:03,502
That includes Mr. Motoyama and I.

326
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:04,802
Who would've even imagined that

327
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:08,702
we'd run into Nose's corpse while heading over to his hotel.

328
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:11,702
Well, we'll get to the details back at the station then.

329
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,902
Inspector!

330
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:17,202
We found this near the corpse.

331
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:19,402
A timetable and can of tennis balls?

332
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:21,502
They're mine!

333
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:22,902
I'm sorry!

334
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:25,702
I seem to have dropped them when I got off the car.

335
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:39,202
"Okinawa Prefecture Police, Naha Headquarters"

336
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:41,602
Inspector! It's been confirmed!

337
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,302
What?

338
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,802
About the phone call.

339
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:51,102
It's true that Mr. Motoyama called Mr. Nose

340
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:55,102
from his hotel in Miyazaki at 7:20 pm to 7:23 pm yesterday.

341
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:56,102
See?

342
00:19:56,102 --> 00:20:02,002
Even without it, I appeared live on TV from Miyazaki last night.

343
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:06,902
Viewers all over the nation will prove my alibi for me.

344
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:09,102
Come to think of it, that's true.

345
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:12,002
And? Have you heard of any characteristics of the man

346
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,202
who was making crank calls to Mr. Nose?

347
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:18,002
No. All he said was an odd man.

348
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,202
An odd man.

349
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,102
It sure is strange, though.

350
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:26,002
I confirmed with his other teammates,

351
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:29,602
but none of them seems to have heard of any crank calls.

352
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:32,502
Of course not.

353
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,702
Nose was the much feared guardian of the Jaguars,

354
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,102
so I'm sure he couldn't mention anything

355
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,902
about being frightened over a crank call.

356
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:42,002
I, however, have been best friends with him for a long time

357
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,402
and there was nothing we didn't talk about with each other.

358
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:45,502
Now that you mentioned it,

359
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:49,102
you entered the team at the same time as Mr. Nose, didn't you?

360
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:50,802
Yes.

361
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:54,202
You were awarded King of Save and Best Rookie the first year.

362
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:56,702
But I damaged my shoulder the second year and underwent an operation.

363
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:58,902
However, I never regained my pitching velocity

364
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,802
and resigned in my fifth year.

365
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,402
I gave in to the second year jinx

366
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:06,602
and was no more than a one-time clutch player.

367
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:08,502
I was planning to tell the young players

368
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:13,302
who are training here with Nose here tomorrow, but...

369
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:15,702
Under the circumstances, I guess it'll be better to cancel

370
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:17,802
the interview of the young players

371
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:20,102
that we were planning to hold tomorrow.

372
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:33,602
At any rate, please arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

373
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:36,702
The devil who got in the way of my best friend

374
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:39,502
making his Japan record of saves.

375
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:41,102
No, not right.

376
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,102
He's the killer.

377
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:48,002
Can I make a phone call?

378
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,402
I'll be done in a minute.

379
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:50,802
Sure, go ahead.

380
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:55,502
But he has an alibi.

381
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,102
Why on earth...

382
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,202
What the...

383
00:22:23,702 --> 00:22:25,802
What is this?

384
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,202
What's this thing that I feel?

385
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,929
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,729
"Timetable"

387
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:38,029
Summer vacation's almost over. Conan, how's your homework coming along?

388
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,029
What about you, Ran?

389
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,929
I wonder if Shinichi's doing okay?
