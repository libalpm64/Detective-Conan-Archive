1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,370
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,070
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,970
The upside down trick is finally solved!

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,470
An unfinished manuscript corners the killer.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,043 --> 00:02:01,743
I, Toshihisa Manda who was confined to my room at the hotel

9
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:04,443
snuck out of the hotel

10
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:09,643
and killed my disciple and ghost writer Kohei Haramoto!

11
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:12,143
Soon afterwards, I returned to the hotel

12
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,243
and established a fake alibi.

13
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:17,243
We were playing baseball

14
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:20,543
and ended up chasing the ball over to Mr. Haramoto's place.

15
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:23,143
And, in the house...

16
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:30,343
We find Mr. Haramoto who had been murdered!

17
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:38,143
"Result of the Tumble (Part 2)"

18
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:39,643
I see.

19
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:42,343
So, when you children came to look for the ball

20
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,243
and took a look into this house,

21
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:47,943
you found this man bleeding from the head and lying on the ground.

22
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:51,343
I wonder if a robber did this.

23
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:54,543
The place doesn't seem to be all that messed up, though.

24
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,043
I think the killer knows him.

25
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,243
What?

26
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,643
Look here.

27
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:05,943
There's a sign that says "Do Not Enter" on the door of this room.

28
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,443
And what about it?

29
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:10,343
It tells you that somebody's in the room.

30
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:11,543
Right.

31
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:13,243
If somebody opens the door, the owner of the house will see him.

32
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:16,343
It'd be impossible to go around behind him without being noticed.

33
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,743
In my case, I would deliberately make noise,

34
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:21,243
and when the person comes out of the room,

35
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,643
I would be waiting with the murder weapon in my hand ready to kill him.

36
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,243
What a frightening thing to say, Ai.

37
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:31,643
Right, I'm sure Mr. Haramoto let the killer into the room himself.

38
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,943
A person like you that he knows well.

39
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:35,143
Huh?

40
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:37,943
What's the estimated time of death that the coroner came up with?

41
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:41,543
About two hours ago, about 3 in the afternoon.

42
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:43,843
By the way, where were you about that time?

43
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:47,243
I was confined to my room at the New Beika Hotel right through

44
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,943
since last night.

45
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:52,343
New Beika Hotel is near here.

46
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:53,943
2 or 3 minutes by car,

47
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,243
and it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes if by bike.

48
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:58,643
Mr. Shimaki, were you with him too?

49
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:03,343
No. I was at the elevator hall near Sensei's room

50
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,943
waiting for the manuscripts to be completed.

51
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:09,843
But, unless he passes by me, he can't leave the hotel,

52
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:12,643
so I don't think he could've snuck out.

53
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,243
And when was the manuscript completed?

54
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:18,943
Hey, hey, don't tell me you're suspecting me?

55
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:20,343
No, that's not it.

56
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,743
We're asking just to be safe. And?

57
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:26,443
Yes, it was completed at about 4pm.

58
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,543
After that, I checked the manuscript in the room of the hotel.

59
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:31,643
Then in order to discuss the next novel,

60
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,043
we took a cab over to Sensei's house.

61
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,243
I see.

62
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:37,843
Could there have been a friend of Mr. Haramoto,

63
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,643
who harbored a grudge against him?

64
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:43,543
I wonder. He was a reticent man.

65
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,243
He said that he wanted to be a novelist

66
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,743
so I had him help me organize my manuscripts and stuff like that.

67
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:53,843
That's why a lot of my novels are in his computer.

68
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:56,143
Even the ones that were turned down are inside.

69
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:57,843
A while ago, you mentioned that

70
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:01,143
you were letting him live in this house or something like that.

71
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:05,743
Yes, this is the house that I lived in with my family

72
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:06,943
but it was getting to small for us,

73
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,843
so we had to get a new house across the street.

74
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,643
Well, my sons have left the house and are on their own,

75
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:13,943
my wife has already passed away,

76
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:17,343
and I'm living in the house opposite all alone.

77
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,343
I didn't feel like having the house demolished,

78
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:22,043
so I had him live here.

79
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,543
For living here alone, his place is quite organized.

80
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:28,943
He had a housekeeper come here once a week.

81
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:35,243
But! I think that Mr. Haramoto liked to organize things to begin with

82
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,843
because only a mirror is in the drawer.

83
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,943
Hey, Conan!

84
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:42,643
But something's strange.

85
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,443
There are blood stains on the desk

86
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:46,543
and a cracked piece of the flower vase on the mirror,

87
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:49,443
there's no blood in the drawer.

88
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:52,043
It looks as if something else were in here.

89
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,043
What?

90
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:57,343
So the culprit was after something that was in this drawer?

91
00:05:57,343 --> 00:06:00,343
Mr. Manda, do you have any idea what it could've been?

92
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:01,843
No.

93
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:05,943
By the way, I think it's about time that you realize.

94
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:10,143
Right. There something even stranger in the room over here.

95
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,343
Strange?

96
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:14,543
See, in this room.

97
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,243
The shelf, shelf!

98
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:21,243
The mini cars, dolls and, books are all toppled upside!

99
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,243
True.

100
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,543
Why?

101
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,043
What the...

102
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,843
A cat?

103
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,743
Your cat?

104
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:34,343
You shouldn't leave your cat to roam at the scene of the crime!

105
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:35,643
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:38,943
I was so upset that I completely forgot.

107
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:41,043
Inspector, a woman has come in front the back door.

108
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:42,543
What's with you people

109
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,843
entering into someone else's house without permission?

110
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:47,343
Ms. Ichimura.

111
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:50,243
Oh, Sensei, you're here?

112
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,843
What? Mr. Haramoto was...

113
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:56,643
I didn't do it. I'm just a housekeeper.

114
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:58,343
Oh, so you're the housekeeper.

115
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,243
Then could you tell us?

116
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:01,343
Yes?

117
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,843
Oh, this is Mr. Haramoto's mischief.

118
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,243
His mischief?

119
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:13,343
Yes, he usually does incomprehensible mischief.

120
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:15,943
Such as stacking slippers up high one after the other,

121
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:19,643
loosen all the light bulbs in the house making them unusable,

122
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:23,243
line up video tapes in the locker and set them up like dominos.

123
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:27,143
Then he watches what happens from hiding and grins.

124
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:32,243
He like to watch me troubled putting everything back in order.

125
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,643
So, it's the same thing here.

126
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:38,843
Because of course he knows I'll be here at this time.

127
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,743
Oh, so it was just mischief?

128
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,943
But, if so, it's understandable.

129
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,143
Yes, although it's really childish.

130
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:50,543
Really. I was wondering what kind of trick this was.

131
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:53,943
No. Mr. Haramoto's not the one who turned everything upside down,

132
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,243
the culprit did it.

133
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,643
See. Look at this book.

134
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,143
The cover is out of place and ripped, right?

135
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:03,943
It's proof that this was turned upside hastily.

136
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:06,143
There is a mini car with a broken side mirror,

137
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,043
and even a doll that has fallen inside the case.

138
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:12,243
These are important collections for Mr. Haramoto.

139
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:16,243
Even if he were to do mischief, I'm sure he'd be more careful.

140
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:18,343
-And... -Since he knew

141
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:20,443
the housekeeper was coming in two hours,

142
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:23,143
he didn't have to rush, is what you want to say, right?

143
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:24,643
Right.

144
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:28,043
Then, the culprit's the one who did it after all, but why?

145
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:30,943
The most thinkable thing is to hide something.

146
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:35,043
Yeah. If only one is turned upside down,

147
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:39,243
it would look unnatural so other things were also turned upside down.

148
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:43,243
May I be excused to leave?

149
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:46,143
It's time that I have to return to the editing section.

150
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:49,943
Hey, you're coming back after you finish the proof, aren't you?

151
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:53,043
We've got to discuss the next story.

152
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,843
But Sensei, we couldn't possibly discuss the next mystery story

153
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,043
on a day like this.

154
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,543
Mystery?

155
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:01,343
I thought you only wrote historical novels.

156
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:04,543
I'm going to challenge a new field.

157
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,043
To tell the truth, it's almost completed.

158
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:09,843
Come to think of it, there were some lined out on that shelf too.

159
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:13,243
Yeah, more than half were mystery stories.

160
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:16,643
Yes, yes, Mr. Haramoto liked detective stories.

161
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:20,843
He used to say that his debut novel would be a detective story.

162
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,843
The detective that Mr. Haramoto was thinking of

163
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,943
-was an interesting character. -Ms. Ichimura,

164
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,943
didn't he ask you to do something for him today?

165
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,143
What?

166
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:34,343
Well, he used to often ask you to go buy things for his collection

167
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:37,343
when he didn't have time to go out.

168
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,943
Today, he asked for morning call and...

169
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:44,143
oh, he asked me to make a dentist appointment too, that's about it.

170
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:46,643
I didn't go buy anything for him.

171
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,343
I see. Well, the thing is,

172
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,343
when I called him a while ago from the hotel, he said that

173
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:53,843
he was glad that his collection was completed.

174
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,443
Oh well, forget it, then.

175
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:58,743
He was probably talking about some useless collection again.

176
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,943
You called Mr. Haramoto today?

177
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:03,643
Yes. When I'm stuck making a story,

178
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:06,643
I call him a lot for a change of mood.

179
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:08,543
How was he back then?

180
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:12,243
He was his own usual self.

181
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,043
I see.

182
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,943
What do you see?

183
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,143
Don't tell me you've figured out who the killer is?

184
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:21,643
Yeah, the culprit didn't try to hide things by turning them upside down,

185
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:25,043
but thought that it would be hidden if things were turned upside down!

186
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,847
The culprit didn't try to hide things by turning them upside down?

187
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,647
But thought that it would be hidden if things were turned upside down?

188
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,047
Rather, to put it accurately,

189
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,247
the culprit thought that it would hide it for him.

190
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,847
Hide it?

191
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:41,847
Hide what?

192
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:44,747
Well, proof of that was kind of messed up

193
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,947
because the culprit got the upper hand, though.

194
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,447
Hey, don't tell me...

195
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,047
That he's the culprit?

196
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:52,047
Yeah, most likely.

197
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:56,447
Okay, I'll finish the proofs and the editing section and come back.

198
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,447
Then, could I be excused too?

199
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:02,447
I'd like to prepare for the discussion, and take him home too.

200
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:03,547
All right.

201
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:06,747
I'll be at home right opposite here, so please call me if you need me.

202
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,647
Hey, he's going to leave!

203
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,447
Is it okay, Conan?

204
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:13,247
You're going to be discussing a detective story

205
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:16,347
that you've never written before, aren't you, sir?

206
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,847
-Yeah. -I can't wait to read it

207
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,447
because I just love mystery stories!

208
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,547
I wonder if any of it is in Mr. Haramoto's computer.

209
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:27,147
I wonder.

210
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,547
Huh, why are you letting him go off so cheerfully?

211
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,047
I thought you were going to corner the culprit.

212
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:38,547
Well, I guess you have your reasons for doing what you're doing.

213
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:41,847
But, your attitude of knowing all by yourself and snickering

214
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,047
really bugs me.

215
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:46,047
Okay, I'll tell you!

216
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,147
But, promise you'll cooperate.

217
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,847
-Sure! -Of course.

218
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:54,747
I mean, his disciple's just been murdered

219
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,747
and I don't see how he can go on with the discussion.

220
00:11:57,747 --> 00:11:58,747
True.

221
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:02,247
What should I do?

222
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:03,747
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:06,447
Well, this mini car is broken!

224
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,047
The side mirror is broken off.

225
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,347
I didn't touch it.

226
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:16,447
Which means that the person who did this was really upset?

227
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,347
But, it's strange.

228
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:23,747
Mr. Haramoto did all this to surprise the housekeeper, right?

229
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:24,847
That's right,

230
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:28,047
because he knew that the housekeeper would be here at 5pm.

231
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,747
I'm sure this collection wasn't all that important to him.

232
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:35,347
But, the novelist said that Mr. Haramoto was saying that

233
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:38,347
his collection was completed so that he was happy.

234
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:42,247
The point is what collections he's talking about.

235
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,647
Yes, we can't tell by his words

236
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,547
whether it was the mini cars, the dolls or the books.

237
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,547
Finally completed.

238
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:52,847
Turned upside down in haste.

239
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,547
Did you catch cold, Conan?

240
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:02,347
No, it's cat hair! There are so many all over here.

241
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,547
Cat?

242
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:07,347
Come to think of it, Mr. Manda let his cat roam here for a while

243
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:08,947
even during investigation.

244
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:11,647
That's why there's so much cat hair here.

245
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,447
Mr. Manda's not very nice, is he?

246
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,847
Oh? What do you mean?

247
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:18,247
Because he heard the sound of something cracking,

248
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:22,347
so he came outside to look and saw us go into the house.

249
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,547
That's why he came after us, right?

250
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:27,247
If I were him, I wouldn't bring the cat here,

251
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,747
and even if I did bring the cat, I would carry it all the while.

252
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:34,347
The kitty may after all, hurt itself with the thing that cracked.

253
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,647
Yeah, it kind of seems like he let the cat go on purpose.

254
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,947
He let the cat go on purpose?

255
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:45,447
Detective Yako Hyakki grinning her tightly pursed lips

256
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,947
and started to reveal the case.

257
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,847
She of course had the police detective speak in her place.

258
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,547
So, this is it.

259
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:08,447
So, you're finally here. What took you so long?

260
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,747
I'm sorry, my hands were somewhat tied.

261
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:15,847
Getting right down to business, please tell me, will you?

262
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:18,347
About the detective story you thought up, Sensei.

263
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,247
You've already started writing it, haven't you?

264
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:23,547
Yeah, the fact is, it's written up to almost the last part

265
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,947
but I'm stuck on how the ending should be

266
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:29,847
since the detective herself is the victim of the murder.

267
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,047
What?

268
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,247
Yeah,

269
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,047
the woman lawyer who is killed at the beginning of the story

270
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:38,547
appears as a ghost and possesses her best friend who is a detective

271
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:41,847
and discloses the truth of the case.

272
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,047
Oh, that sounds interesting.

273
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,347
The name of the character playing the woman lawyer-detective

274
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:48,947
is Yako Hyakki.

275
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:50,747
Great name, isn't it?

276
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,047
Who could it be at this time of night?

277
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:58,347
Inspector.

278
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,947
I'm sorry, but could you wait until our discussion is over

279
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:01,447
if you need to talk to me?

280
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,847
No, we'll need you to talk to us,

281
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,047
because we've finally figured it out.

282
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,547
You've figured it out?

283
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:10,147
You mean who the murderer is?

284
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,247
Yes.

285
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:15,347
The one who killed Mr. Haramoto is you, Mr. Manda!

286
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,947
Huh?

287
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:19,047
It sure was a surprise,

288
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:22,547
that the novelist Mr. Manda was the killer.

289
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,247
But, wasn't Mr. Manda

290
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:27,147
confined to the room in that hotel from last night,

291
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:29,147
and during the time the murder was committed at about 3pm,

292
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:30,847
wasn't he in the room?

293
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,647
The editor, Mr. Shimaki

294
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:35,647
couldn't have been watching in front of the door all the while,

295
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:37,747
so Mr. Manda probably snuck out of the room

296
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:40,147
disguised as a bellboy or something.

297
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,647
Then, with a bicycle or something that he had prepared beforehand,

298
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,347
and rushed over to Mr. Haramoto's house.

299
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:49,647
Then, he snuck up from behind and hit him with the flower vase.

300
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,847
His alibi was supposed to be established

301
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:54,347
after rushing back to the hotel,

302
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:56,347
but a problem came up.

303
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:59,047
Yes, the cat that you brought along

304
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:03,947
disappeared in the room next to the murder site.

305
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:07,647
You panicked and looked for him but he wouldn't come out,

306
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,847
and that's when you remembered that

307
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:14,847
Mr. Haramoto had told you that his collection was finally completed

308
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,347
and that he was happy.

309
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:20,147
You live right opposite Mr. Haramoto.

310
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,947
If you leave the backdoor open,

311
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:26,247
the cat would come back on its own if it gets hungry.

312
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:29,447
But if before that the cat walks around

313
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,947
and cat hair is found on the collection that was just completed today,

314
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:38,247
it would serve as proof that you had come to the room today.

315
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,547
After all, the cat as well as yourself

316
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:43,547
were supposed to be confined in the hotel room from last night.

317
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,247
That's when you came upon the idea of

318
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:48,447
turning all of Mr. Haramoto's collection upside

319
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:51,547
and making the housekeeper, Ms. Ichimura who will come in two hours

320
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:55,347
straighten everything out, so that the cat hair will fall to the floor.

321
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,347
But, will just turning everything upside down

322
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:59,747
make cat hair come off that easily?

323
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,747
It doesn't really matter,

324
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:05,647
so long as Ms. Ichimura testifies that she turned them back up.

325
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,747
Because the cat hair that's on the floor

326
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:09,447
could've got on to the collection

327
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,347
while she was returning the collection right side up.

328
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:14,447
But, I wonder why he did something so bothersome

329
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,647
as to turn everything upside down.

330
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:20,147
If it were me, I would just drop everything to the floor.

331
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:23,047
That wouldn't look like mischief, would it?

332
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,747
If she thinks that a thief entered the house

333
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:28,147
and called the police, that would be it, right?

334
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:33,647
But, we found it before the housekeeper came.

335
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:37,447
Right, so I'm sure Mr. Manda was really flustered.

336
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,147
That's why he had to think even deeper.

337
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:43,547
When he saw us go into the house,

338
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:44,847
Mr. Manda on the spur of the moment carried his cat

339
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,247
and ran over right away.

340
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,747
Then, he let the cat go in that room.

341
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,247
So that nobody would be able to tell

342
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,847
when the cat hair scattered all over the place.

343
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:56,647
I see! That's why he got angry when I tried to touch the cat.

344
00:17:56,647 --> 00:18:00,247
If the police came while I was carrying the cat,

345
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,047
his whole plan would've gone to waste.

346
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:07,247
But, he succeeded in getting rid of the evidence.

347
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:10,847
With no proof, he could say it's just your imagination.

348
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:14,047
Yeah, but I left bait behind.

349
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:17,847
That's terrific deduction, Inspector.

350
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:22,147
I'd recommend that you write a mystery novel.

351
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:28,147
But, where's the proof? You can't arrest me without it.

352
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,647
Of course, I'm not the killer though.

353
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:35,147
I'll make use of this in my next detective story...

354
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:40,047
There were detective stories in Mr. Haramoto's computer too.

355
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,647
The unfinished mystery story

356
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:46,447
of ghost detective Yako Hyakki, the main character!

357
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:49,647
We asked for Editor Shimaki's cooperation,

358
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:53,347
and set a microphone on his clothes.

359
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:55,547
What we heard through the microphone of your next story

360
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,947
also had to do with a ghost detective by the name of Yako Hyakki.

361
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:03,147
That's why I told you, didn't I? That he took care of all my works.

362
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,247
Oh, that's right.

363
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:08,047
Were you the one who wrote all of it?

364
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,047
Well, of course.

365
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:11,747
To be honest,

366
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:14,947
the children who were playing around with the computer found it.

367
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,547
The children and my men were reading it till a while ago,

368
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:20,447
hoping it would give us some clue.

369
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,447
I'm ashamed to say, there is something I cannot understand that

370
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,547
I would like you to tell me about.

371
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:27,947
Who is the killer and what kind of trick was used?

372
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:30,347
That's...

373
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:36,147
I don't mind if you'd show me the disc case with that story in it.

374
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:39,547
The disc case that you stole from Mr. Haramoto's desk,

375
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:42,847
the one with what looks to be his blood on the case.

376
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,747
You should've been reading it till just a while ago!

377
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:49,747
After you came back from the hotel till the time you found Mr. Haramoto,

378
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,847
and when you got home just a while ago,

379
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,747
you were with the editor right through

380
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:56,247
and wouldn't have had time to read it at all!

381
00:19:56,247 --> 00:20:00,447
Despite this, you explained the story to Mr. Shimaki just a while ago!

382
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:02,547
Don't tell that the boy...

383
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,947
I can't wait to read it.

384
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:07,847
I wonder if it's in Mr. Haramoto's computer.

385
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,247
He set it up so that the novel would be read

386
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:13,447
before I got to hide the disc that is evidence.

387
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:17,547
That disc and case are in your room, aren't they?

388
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:22,247
Sensei!

389
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,047
I'm no longer a Sensei.

390
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:30,647
I'm just a plain aged man, who lost his wife

391
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,147
and have no energy left to do anything.

392
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:38,747
All my stories for the last 2 to 3 years were written by Mr. Haramoto.

393
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:43,647
Of course, I did a lot of fixing at the start.

394
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,147
But, he gradually started disliking me fixing his story,

395
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:49,847
and lately I haven't been able to say a thing about his works.

396
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,547
Then, finally...

397
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:52,947
Please leave everything up to me,

398
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:56,247
while you sit in the audience already,

399
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:59,647
since you've already passed over your baton.

400
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:03,447
I just couldn't forgive those words of his,

401
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:07,147
because they were so sad and so vexing.

402
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:10,747
Then, why did you steal his detective story?

403
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,747
I suddenly came up with the idea

404
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:16,847
that I could probably write better than he can.

405
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:19,247
But, I lost.

406
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,647
No matter how hard I think,

407
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:24,247
I could never figure out who the killer or what the trick is.

408
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:29,247
I guess I was never cut out to write mysteries.

409
00:22:56,547 --> 00:23:00,247
Oh, the conversation with the housekeeper.

410
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,847
Yeah, when she tried to talk about the detective

411
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,147
that Mr. Haramoto thought up,

412
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:07,947
Mr. Manda interrupted her.

413
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:10,547
That's when I hit upon the idea that maybe he stole Mr. Haramoto's story.

414
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,547
But, there's still a mystery left.

415
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:14,847
Huh? The killer in that novel is...

416
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,247
No, not that.

417
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:19,447
About the collection that Mr. Haramoto said he finally completed.

418
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:20,947
Oh, that?

419
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,747
He was probably talking about his teeth.

420
00:23:22,747 --> 00:23:24,247
What?

421
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,947
Ms. Ichimura the housekeeper said that

422
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:30,347
Mr. Haramoto had told her to make a dentist appointment for him today.

423
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:33,247
Remember the mirror that was in the desk?

424
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,047
I think that Mr. Haramoto was looking at his teeth

425
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,147
that were finally nicely in place at the time he was struck.

426
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,647
Besides, one of the pieces of the flower vase

427
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:43,047
that was found in the drawer

428
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,747
was a crown.

429
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:46,247
What?

430
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:50,447
Why didn't you tell something important like that to Inspector Megure?

431
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:53,247
Because I already figured out who the killer was

432
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:56,247
and besides, this had nothing to do with the case.

433
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:59,547
That's why it doesn't matter.

434
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,380
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,760
"Marinated ginger slices from a sushi shop"

436
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,380
What kind of fish is a "gari"?

437
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,200
Oh come on, that's what marinated ginger slices are called.

438
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,580
Really, a moronic gink.
