1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,655
We, who came to an Aso, Kumamoto sightseeing tour,

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,555
got involved in a case in which

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:08,255
the confidential data of Kumamon Foods was stolen

4
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:11,991
and an amount of 10,000,000 yen was being demanded.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,155
The culprit had hidden the USB memory stick

6
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:16,755
with the confidential data inside it

7
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,755
into the Kumamon stuffed doll,

8
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:22,001
but from a queer turn of fate,

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,355
that doll falls into the hands of Justin, who we ran into on our tour.

10
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:30,009
Going on the words that Justin had left behind as clues,

11
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,355
we somehow managed to find him.

12
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,655
But right after that, to our surprise Justin is kidnapped,

13
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:41,255
stuffed doll and all, by the culprit right before our eyes!

14
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:45,255
Is there a spy accomplice to the culprit among us?

15
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:48,855
And who on earth is the culprit?

16
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,055
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

17
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:06,045
are slashed by the light of deduction.

18
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,655
The mystery gathers at Kumamoto Castle.

19
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,049
The mystery involving the USB memory stick is disclosed.

20
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,455
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,255
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:15,555
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:50,996
"Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Kumamoto Edition)"

24
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:56,496
After that, we got no demands from the culprit

25
00:02:56,496 --> 00:03:00,159
and stayed overnight at a hotel in Kumamoto City.

26
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,696
It sort of turned out to be a strange trip!

27
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:09,296
-What? -Hey, Genta!

28
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:10,496
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:13,096
No, that's not what I meant!

30
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:14,896
It's not your fault, Ayumi!

31
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:17,296
So saying she'd be bothered about it either way, right?

32
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,696
Yeah.

33
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,696
Mr. Mouri!

34
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:26,185
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

35
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,187
Did you get a call from the culprit or something?

36
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:31,996
Yes, sir. Kumamon Foods got a call

37
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:34,193
from the culprit telling them to bring 10,000,000 yen to Kumamoto City.

38
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,496
Therefore, Mr. Kumada and the others have come here

39
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,896
and are gathered in the conference room.

40
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:40,996
Okay.

41
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,896
Ran, take care of the children, will you?

42
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:44,796
Yep.

43
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:50,209
Huh? Conan?

44
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,596
I'll go look for him.

45
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:53,596
Okay, please do.

46
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,796
Yes. I'm with the people from the police right now.

47
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:13,196
What on earth shall I do?

48
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,239
-Here. -Thank you.

49
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,245
A child's been kidnapped?

50
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,096
What on earth are the police doing anyway?

51
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,896
We're very sorry.

52
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,396
Did the culprit specify the site of the deal?

53
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:38,696
No, he just said he'd get a hold of me later.

54
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:42,261
Why would a mere data of the company being stolen

55
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:45,496
turn into a kidnap case?

56
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:46,896
Hey, Inoue!

57
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:48,796
Just what do you mean by "mere data of the company being stolen"?

58
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:51,996
I'm sure you know how important that data is

59
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,796
to our company too, don't you?

60
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,096
But being the situation it is now,

61
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,996
the child's life is above all priority, right?

62
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,279
What? You dare stand against me or what?

63
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,283
Well, well, let's not get all heated up.

64
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,285
For the time being,

65
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,796
let's wait for the next call from the culprit.

66
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:11,196
What's this?

67
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:13,796
Feeling of something not being right.

68
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:16,796
The child's life is more important than the data...

69
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,696
That's true, but...

70
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:21,196
Conan.

71
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,303
Ai. Don't scare me like that.

72
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,596
I want a word with you.

73
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:29,796
"Kumamoto Ramen shop"

74
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:35,896
Three orders of Kumamoto ramen, please!

75
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:40,319
Why do you want to take my Kumamon?

76
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,796
Come on, tell me.

77
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,096
Shut up and eat.

78
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:53,196
No! Don't!

79
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:55,496
This is Justin's!

80
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,196
Just what're you doing to mommy?

81
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,396
I'm going to turn anybody

82
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,896
that does something bad to mommy to the police!

83
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,296
Name card?

84
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,896
Right, probably her husband's.

85
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,096
The name "Naoto Takamori" was written on it, you see.

86
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:13,196
Then, Jessica was placing a call to her husband?

87
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:15,896
But, wouldn't she normally have her husband's number

88
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,896
registered in her cell phone?

89
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:20,359
I don't know why,

90
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,996
but that name card was of Higo Foods.

91
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,363
Higo Foods?

92
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,365
If I remember correctly, wasn't that...

93
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,996
But if that development data is stolen by another company...

94
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:33,696
like Higo Foods, a major company in this business,

95
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:36,375
we're finished!

96
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,896
Justin's father is the president of Higo Foods.

97
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,396
Could this be a mere coincidence?

98
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:44,096
Or...

99
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,696
Hey!

100
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,389
Where are you guys going?

101
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:55,296
We managed to make it through without Ran seeing us, you see.

102
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,396
Just what do you think you're doing?

103
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,396
Come on, let's go!

104
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:00,399
So, where are we going?

105
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,401
We, the Youth Detective Squad,

106
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,796
are going to go look for Justin!

107
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:06,796
That's dangerous.

108
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,696
Oh, no! He caught us in the act.

109
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,796
That wound on your arm...

110
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,496
You got hurt when an accomplice of the culprit

111
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,696
hit you with the bag he had, didn't you?

112
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,496
But next time, maybe you won't get away

113
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:25,396
with just getting hurt, you know?

114
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:28,427
Were you there back then, Mr. Inoue?

115
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,396
President, did you call for me?

116
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,396
You're late, Inoue!

117
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:34,433
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:36,996
But why are the police here?

119
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,696
If I remember correctly, didn't you come here

120
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,496
after the president called for you?

121
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,596
I heard about it from the president,

122
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,096
that a girl called Ayumi got hurt.

123
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:48,096
You're Ayumi, aren't you?

124
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:51,596
Yes, sir. But I'm to blame.

125
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:55,796
Because I interfered.

126
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,296
If you so insist, I'll go with you.

127
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:03,696
After all to begin with, our company is to blame

128
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:06,096
for getting our confidential data stolen.

129
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,396
During the 2nd call from the culprit,

130
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:18,196
I heard the sound of a tram in the background.

131
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:22,481
But there are two tram lines in Kumamoto,

132
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:26,896
with a total of 35 tam stops.

133
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,196
With only that much to go on...

134
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:32,996
"Found lost stamp book"

135
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,493
That's...

136
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,495
It's this.

137
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,896
No doubt about it. This is Justin's stamp book!

138
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,096
He deliberately left it behind a while ago,

139
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,503
to let us know his whereabouts, right?

140
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:47,296
Was he with someone else?

141
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:50,096
The thing is... He was with a suspicious looking man

142
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,996
who was wearing sunglasses and a mask.

143
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,496
I wonder if that was his father?

144
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:58,996
Which means he's still with the culprit.

145
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,296
And, would you have any idea which way they went?

146
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:04,523
If I remember correctly, it was...

147
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,196
"Shimotori Arcade" -They walked through the arcade

148
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,196
and went toward the castle.

149
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:13,496
Oh, no. She found out.

150
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:15,596
Hello, Ran?

151
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,696
Hey, Conan. Where are you?

152
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:18,796
Is everyone else with you too?

153
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:21,396
Just what do you brats think you're doing, going off on your own?

154
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,096
We're not only going around on our own.

155
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,096
Mr. Inoue's here with us, too.

156
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,545
What?

157
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,596
-I don't care who you're with. -That American-Japanese boy

158
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,196
that we just saw was really cute, wasn't he?

159
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:32,996
-You can say that again! -That's why brats like you guys...

160
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,296
Excuse me!

161
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:39,196
The American-Japanese boy, what kind of a boy was he?

162
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,996
It's him.

163
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,596
It's Justin, after all!

164
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,696
Where did you take this picture?

165
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:46,896
A little ways ahead.

166
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:48,567
Just about in front of the Karaoke shop.

167
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:52,296
I see.

168
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,696
He's not here.

169
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:56,896
Maybe he already left to go elsewhere?

170
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,996
Excuse me.

171
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:03,896
Didn't you see an American-Japanese boy about our age?

172
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,396
-We did! -We did!

173
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,996
We saw him around that convenience store over there.

174
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:10,589
He even winked at me, you know!

175
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,296
He was awesome!

176
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,896
Is he a child model?

177
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,196
Just as expected.

178
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,595
Yeah.

179
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:19,296
He's doing all this deliberately

180
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,396
to let us know where he is.

181
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,603
He's pretty sly.

182
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:31,242
"Bronze statue of Seishoko"

183
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:34,242
Hey, look, look. Take a look at him!

184
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,615
He's so cute!

185
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,142
He's so adult-like.

186
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:39,842
My, he's cute!

187
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:41,242
Really!

188
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,621
Awesome!

189
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,142
Just what do you think you're doing, brat?

190
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:51,442
We're standing out too much!

191
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,633
"Josai Garden"

192
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,942
Stay still and play over here.

193
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,742
Don't you dare do anything funny.

194
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,642
I'm keeping my eyes on you, understand?

195
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:05,442
Okay.

196
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:13,742
Did you get the money ready?

197
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,442
Yeah! It's right here!

198
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,655
Listen well.

199
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
Put the bag of money

200
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,659
under the large gingko tree of Kumamoto Castle!

201
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,742
If I even get a glimpse of the police,

202
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,942
I won't guarantee the child's life, get that?

203
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:29,142
I'm sure that they'll...

204
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,642
Let me go! What do you think you're doing?

205
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,342
Watch out!

206
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,683
I'm sure that they'll...

207
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,442
Kumamoto Castle?

208
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,842
I was told to put the bag with the money

209
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,842
inside under the large gingko tree of Kumamoto Castle.

210
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,442
This'll probably be our last chance.

211
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:01,742
We've got to nab the culprit no matter what, this time!

212
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:05,342
But if the culprit was where we goofed on the previous deal

213
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:07,742
and watching from close range,

214
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:11,142
there's a possibility that all of our faces have been seen.

215
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:12,242
Yeah.

216
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:16,042
If he finds out that we're keeping watch from close by,

217
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:18,442
the child's life will be endangered.

218
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,342
I've got one!

219
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,142
An idea!

220
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:26,442
Why not let I, Kogoro Mouri take care of this?

221
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,042
Hey, wait. Are you going to be all right, dad?

222
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,442
I hope you find your friend soon.

223
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:36,735
Thank you.

224
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:39,842
Like the woman at the ramen shop was saying a while ago...

225
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,642
Could the kidnaper of the child be his father?

226
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:46,442
The kidnapper of the child?

227
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,342
Conan!

228
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:52,042
There was a person who saw Justin at Wakuwaku-za!

229
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,442
Wakuwaku-za?

230
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,042
Where are we headed for next?

231
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,542
Shut up and come with me!

232
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,342
There he is!

233
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,763
The kidnapper's with him, too!

234
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,765
He's not getting away!

235
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,742
What took you guys so long?

236
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,773
Stay away!

237
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,742
Don't move! Or else, I'll...

238
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,842
Darn! Hold it!

239
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:26,785
Pass!

240
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,842
Give it to me!

241
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,542
Conan!

242
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,542
You brats!

243
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,842
Ai!

244
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,342
No, I'll get it!

245
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:44,803
Stay out of my way!

246
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,242
Too bad!

247
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,842
Darn it!

248
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,142
Leave the rest to me and go after the culprit, Conan!

249
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:10,342
Okay, I'm counting on you, Ai!

250
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:14,042
"Kumamoto Castle"

251
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:20,042
"Honmaru Goten"

252
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:34,142
All of you!

253
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,442
Intruder! Nab him!

254
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,242
Aye...

255
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,342
I'm the boss of this castle!

256
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,873
One word from me and this is what you get!

257
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:59,142
Officer Kosugi helped you out by showing his police badge, didn't he?

258
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:01,342
Darn it!

259
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:04,642
Don't you care what happens to the kid or what?

260
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:07,242
He's only bluffing!

261
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:10,889
I'm over here!

262
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:11,742
Justin!

263
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,242
Mommy!

264
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,642
Darn it!

265
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:20,899
That voice...

266
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,742
You're Mr. Koda, aren't you?

267
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,905
Don't!

268
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,907
Koda?

269
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,642
I received mail from you saying that you wanted me to contact you

270
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:33,442
when we figured out Justin's whereabouts and so I did.

271
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:37,742
Other than that, major tourists sites to the north

272
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:42,042
are the Kuninomiyatsuko Shrine and Mt. Daikanbo.

273
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,542
Mt. Daikanbo?

274
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:45,542
I see!

275
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,142
Justin didn't say "A big pig",

276
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,929
but rather, "A big Buddha"!

277
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,342
A big Buddha is lying asleep...

278
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,642
That's...

279
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,935
It's the landscape of Aso that looks to be the dying Buddha

280
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,442
attaining Nirvana that can be seen from Mt. Daikanbo.

281
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:02,242
I've got to let Mr. Koda know!

282
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:07,742
I had no idea that you were up to something like this.

283
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:10,242
I needed money!

284
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12,542
I lost a great deal of money gambling

285
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,242
and had a large debt borrowing from a loan shark.

286
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,542
I had to make ends meet!

287
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,957
I was stabbed with a knife

288
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,959
saying that they won't be lenient with me just because I'm a cop.

289
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,542
They threatened me saying that the next time around,

290
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:23,842
they won't spare my life.

291
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:27,342
So that's the truth of why you were stabbed by a thug.

292
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:32,042
Who's the culprit?

293
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,242
So you're the one who was at Cuddly Dominion

294
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:37,442
when a girl called Ai got in the way and...

295
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:40,442
No. The girl's name is Ayumi.

296
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,742
Who cares which it is!

297
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:45,242
You're the officer who went after the man that fled back then.

298
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:48,642
I get it. Everything's clear now!

299
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,742
Ai, can you hear me?

300
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:54,542
Why'd you dare rob our company?

301
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,995
How'd you know about the confidential data?

302
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,742
Maybe somebody else stole it.

303
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:04,342
Because on the day that Kumamon Foods was robbed,

304
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:07,542
Mr. Koda was still hospitalized, right?

305
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:13,442
Then where's the confidential data for the new product?

306
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,142
Where'd my Kumamon go?

307
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:18,742
As to that, we know where it is.

308
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,642
Come with me!

309
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,442
I found it!

310
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,142
Really, Ayumi?

311
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:30,342
See. The memory stick is intact right here, too!

312
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,842
I guess you're right.

313
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,442
Well done, Ayumi!

314
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,033
You did it!

315
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:38,742
Thank you! You've saved our company!

316
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,742
Yep! Here you go!

317
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:44,442
No! Don't give it to him yet.

318
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,442
Just what do you...

319
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,542
The great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

320
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,053
Off I go!

321
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:03,742
Dad?

322
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,142
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

323
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:12,442
Mr. Inoue, I have a question I'd like to ask you.

324
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:13,942
What could it be?

325
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:18,842
Isn't this case something you yourself planned and acted out?

326
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:25,542
Just what do you mean by that?

327
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:28,842
I'm asking you whether you're the one

328
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:33,742
who stole the confidential data of Kumamon Foods, Mr. Inoue.

329
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,242
Just what do you think you're saying?

330
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,942
I heard from Conan

331
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:41,442
that you weren't at Cuddly Dominion,

332
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:43,742
the site of the deal yesterday.

333
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:49,542
And yet you knew about the culprit throwing the bag at her.

334
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,111
You seem to have said that

335
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,113
you heard about this from President Kumada?

336
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:58,142
However, President Kumada had mistakenly thought that

337
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:01,842
Ayumi Yoshida was Ai Haibara,

338
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:04,142
and remembered one for the other.

339
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,642
So you're the one who was at Cuddly Dominion

340
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:10,642
when a girl called Ai got in the way and...

341
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,642
No. The girl's name is Ayumi.

342
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:15,133
Who cares which it is!

343
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:19,842
That's why if you really heard about it from President Kumada,

344
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,342
you would have heard, "A girl named Ai got hit

345
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:24,142
by the bag the culprit threw at her."

346
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:26,742
But you asked not Ai Haibara,

347
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:29,842
but Ayumi Yoshida whether she was okay.

348
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,242
That's because back then...

349
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,142
You were also at the scene of the crime!

350
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,042
To get the money that the executer of the crime

351
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,642
was supposed to give you.

352
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,742
But the plan failed!

353
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,442
Since you were urgently called

354
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:53,442
by President Kumada to explain the situation,

355
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,542
you made it look as if you rushed over just now

356
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,177
and appeared before us.

357
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,342
Isn't that right?

358
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:06,242
I don't remember telling you anything like that!

359
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:07,642
It's true that on that day

360
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:10,142
I was at the scene where the deal took place.

361
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,042
I admit that.

362
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:15,193
But that's only because I was concerned about the deal!

363
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,642
If you so insist...

364
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:19,197
Officer Kosugi!

365
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:23,842
You have a USB port on your tablet, don't you?

366
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:26,542
Yes, there is.

367
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,842
Then, you can confirm right now

368
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:32,442
what's inside the USB memory stick that was retrieved, can't you?

369
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,542
Well, not really.

370
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,942
What's wrong?

371
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,342
If that's really the data that was stolen,

372
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,942
wouldn't you be able to view it right now?

373
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,221
If it's confidential,

374
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,225
I don't mind you showing it only to President Kumada, you know.

375
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:50,042
How about it, Inoue?

376
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,242
Be it something that you planned and acted out yourself,

377
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:56,042
you couldn't bring yourself to steal the real data.

378
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,235
In other words,

379
00:20:57,442 --> 00:21:01,239
confidential data was never stolen to begin with!

380
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,942
I couldn't stand the president's overbearing

381
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,242
and haughty attitude towards me,

382
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:14,442
treating me like his henchman.

383
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:18,242
So, all I wanted to do was give him a little trouble.

384
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,642
But the police turns up

385
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:24,342
and partway it switches to a real kidnap case.

386
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,442
Since gradually start getting more and more serious,

387
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,742
I couldn't make myself come out and tell the truth anymore.

388
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:01,942
"Hosokawa Gyobu Mansion"

389
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:09,367
It seems that Justin's father had already passed away.

390
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,742
It seems that the phone call that Jessica was making

391
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:17,375
was to discuss the case with a colleague of her father.

392
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,742
That's why his name wasn't registered

393
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:25,383
and she was looking at the name card.

394
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:28,342
Now I understand why Justin was trying to protect his mother

395
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,842
anytime something came up.

396
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:34,742
He probably felt like he had to do his father's share, too.

397
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:37,142
Yeah. Because after all to him...

398
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:43,401
Mommy is number one.

399
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,880
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,660
"Receipt"

401
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:52,740
That was a close call, wasn't it?

402
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,158
I guess it's my turn next.

403
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:55,413
Let's see what happens in the next episode.
