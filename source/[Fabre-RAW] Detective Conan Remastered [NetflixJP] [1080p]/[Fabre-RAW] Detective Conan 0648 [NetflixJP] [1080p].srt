1
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,987
All right, let me introduce her.

2
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:15,995
She will be joining our class as of today.

3
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,229
This is Sera.

4
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,429
Sera?

5
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,329
A transfer student?

6
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,129
What the... she's wearing a skirt.

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,429
A girl?

8
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,029
My name is Masumi Sera.

9
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,329
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,037
If all cases were men,

11
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,729
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

12
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,429
The Mouri Detective Agency is being targeted.

13
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,529
What's the demand of the culprit who holed himself up?

14
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,129
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,129
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,029
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:38,876
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Outbreak)"

18
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,076
So, say...

19
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:43,476
Sera, where do you live?

20
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,676
Well, for right now I'm living at a hotel, I guess.

21
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,147
Where are you from?

22
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:52,151
I'd been living with my parents in America since three years ago,

23
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,153
but I rebelled, saying that I'd rather live in Japan

24
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,155
where I was born and raised,

25
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,157
so I came back to Tokyo.

26
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:01,276
It's easier to be a detective here, too.

27
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:03,276
So you're a detective, Sera?

28
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,276
A female Kudo.

29
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,165
Kudo?

30
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,167
The pride of Teitan High here,

31
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,169
he's a high school detective.

32
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,176
A renowned detective.

33
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,976
Although, right now he's in leave of absence.

34
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,976
Sera sure is popular, right?

35
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,176
You're right.

36
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:26,185
She's cheerful, sociable, boyish, and cute.

37
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,776
On top of it,

38
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:30,776
she's a female detective who uses Jeet Kune-Do

39
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,191
and evenly-matched with you.

40
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,876
Maybe she's a tomboy too.

41
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:38,197
Well, the only thing that's left to be desired are her small breasts.

42
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,476
I'm sorry for being flat-chested then.

43
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,076
But...

44
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,076
My mom's bosoms are pretty huge,

45
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,976
so mine should eventually develop, right?

46
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:49,776
I guess...

47
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:50,976
You're right.

48
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:55,476
Anyway, is it true that Conan is living at Mr. Mouri's place?

49
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,976
Yes, it's true.

50
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,219
Then is it all right if I came over?

51
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,776
Sure, but if I recall, today Conan is...

52
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,476
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Oh, no.

53
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,576
He just left now?

54
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:10,229
Was it to that Dr. What's-his-name's house?

55
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,233
Yes, since they're going camping early tomorrow morning,

56
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:17,176
he said he's staying over there with the other brats tonight.

57
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:20,239
Darn. By the slightest of margins?

58
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,241
Who is this girl?

59
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,776
Sera, a transfer student.

60
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,176
She says she's a detective.

61
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,576
A female high school detective?

62
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:32,251
Then, have you heard of the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri here?

63
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:35,376
Yes. Sleeping Kogoro, right?

64
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,257
When I checked the Japanese news via the internet,

65
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,976
your name came up frequently.

66
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:43,776
Sera said she was living in America up until recently.

67
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:48,276
I read that you've resolved tons of difficult cases.

68
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,269
Yes, got that right.

69
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,976
And the one who's always with you

70
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:56,275
is Conan Edogawa, isn't it?

71
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,076
Yes... well...

72
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:02,776
So then, why don't you have dad tell you all about his cases?

73
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:05,976
You'd think so, but I can't remember most of them.

74
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:10,289
As a detective, I'd love to hear some stories

75
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,876
but it can wait until next time.

76
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:15,676
I'll listen to all there is to say when Conan is around.

77
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:19,176
About your stories,

78
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:22,776
please tell us every single detail.

79
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:24,976
"Tamami Mitsui (41)" -The three of us

80
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,976
are popular female mystery writers.

81
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:31,176
"Shinobu Yuchi (36)" -And we're friends who met via SNS.

82
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,576
"Sumika Nihei (39)" -We were told that we could hear

83
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:36,576
the stories of the Great Detective Mouri if we came here today.

84
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:39,276
Didn't you hear about it from Mr. Sawaguri?

85
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:42,321
Well, first of all, what is SNS?

86
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,676
Social Networking Service.

87
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,976
The stuff on the internet

88
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:48,776
where you can communicate with a variety of people.

89
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:51,976
Excuse me, could that Ms. Sawaguri you're referring

90
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:56,335
to be the mystery writer Miku Sawaguri who passed away last month?

91
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,976
Yes, she was also one of our SNS buddies.

92
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:02,976
But the one who invited us here today is...

93
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,476
her elder brother...

94
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,576
Right.

95
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,576
"Isao Sawaguri (37)" -Yours truly.

96
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:12,976
Mr. Sawaguri.

97
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:14,353
What's going on?

98
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,676
It seems they haven't heard of the arrangement.

99
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,576
But of course.

100
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,676
Cause I never made an appointment.

101
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:31,276
Each of you, put your cell phones on the desk

102
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:33,076
and go to the far wall now.

103
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,376
-What's this? -All about?

104
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,876
Don't mess around. Do it now!

105
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:40,076
-Yes. -Yes...

106
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:45,076
I'll take the feet.

107
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:46,385
You, the gun.

108
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:50,376
And we'll overpower that guy, okay?

109
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,376
Hey.

110
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,976
Once you've put it down, get going!

111
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,176
Yes, yes.

112
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:03,876
Hey, you.

113
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:05,776
What the heck is this about?

114
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,876
Better let go.

115
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:13,976
I did hear you have a daughter who is adept at karate, but...

116
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,376
Never thought there'd be two of them.

117
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:21,176
I was right to come with these strapped on.

118
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:32,776
Now... Let's hear your brilliant deduction, Sleeping Kogoro.

119
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,776
Then, that detective named Sera,

120
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:42,776
knew your name as well as the fact that you were a detective?

121
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:43,976
Yes.

122
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:46,976
Well, he could just be a fan who became interested

123
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:49,776
after learning about you from the papers and such.

124
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:54,076
Besides, you were the one who figured out the truth

125
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,976
of the case in the end, weren't you?

126
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,476
So much for being a detective.

127
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,276
You're right.

128
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,459
Although I somehow feel

129
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,076
as if that wannabe already figured out the truth,

130
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:06,876
made a mistake on purpose in order to get me to deduce it.

131
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:07,876
Hold on.

132
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:09,476
You went ahead and began your deduction

133
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:13,476
using Shinichi Kudo's voice in front of someone that suspicious?

134
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,876
Well... I couldn't think of anything else to do.

135
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:20,176
Besides, rather than being an enemy,

136
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:23,776
somehow it feels like we've met somewhere before.

137
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:27,176
Perhaps that person resembles someone I know

138
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:30,076
that's why I feel as if we've met before.

139
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,176
What's on your mind, exactly?

140
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,576
No.

141
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:34,876
Speaking of on my mind,

142
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,876
the high school student that Ran was with...

143
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:41,076
Yes, some guy we don't know, right?

144
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,576
Ran was with a guy you don't know?

145
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:44,776
We saw them across the street from us

146
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,505
when we were coming here.

147
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,576
But, wasn't that person a girl?

148
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,976
Was it or not?

149
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,511
If that's on your mind,

150
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:54,976
why don't you call and find out?

151
00:08:56,515 --> 00:09:01,276
The loud noise just now was from a detective drama,

152
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:05,276
the volume got stuck for a bit, but we got it fixed.

153
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:09,176
Yes, I do apologize for the trouble.

154
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,976
All right, that's fine.

155
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,876
Now, great detective,

156
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,276
you'll grant my wish.

157
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,176
That's my cell phone.

158
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:25,476
Darn. You didn't turn it off?

159
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:26,976
If you make the wrong move and turn it off,

160
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,176
they'll suspect you.

161
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,276
What?

162
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,976
The other side knows it's turned on and ringing,

163
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,976
so if no one picks it up, they may worry

164
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:36,276
and come to check on her.

165
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:40,176
I think it's best to just answer appropriately, and then hang up.

166
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:42,076
Guess so.

167
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:45,776
But in exchange, if you even let slip one word...

168
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:47,476
We know already.

169
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,569
Hello.

170
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
Ran? It's me.

171
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,376
Did I call at a bad time?

172
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,176
It's all right.

173
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,577
It's just that I was in the restroom.

174
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,876
Well, it's not a big deal,

175
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,581
but Genta and the others

176
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,276
told me that you were walking with some guy they didn't know.

177
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:09,776
Walking with some guy they didn't know?

178
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,376
I guess you mean the one who just transferred today...

179
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,876
It was me!

180
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,276
Why her?

181
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:18,597
So now you know,

182
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,076
just enjoy camping tomorrow.

183
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:23,876
That should do it, right?

184
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,776
Put the phone back on the desk and move back.

185
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:28,607
Sure thing.

186
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:33,276
Regardless...

187
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,876
the request you just spoke of...

188
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,376
Can you tell it to us again?

189
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,276
It was kinda complicated,

190
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:43,276
so I couldn't quite catch on hearing it only once.

191
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,976
Hey. So who was that guy?

192
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:48,627
-Please tell us. -Conan.

193
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,631
This cell phone...

194
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,633
is still connected.

195
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,876
Geez, very well.

196
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,576
I'll explain it once more,

197
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,676
so you'd better listen up.

198
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,976
My sister Miku Sawaguri,

199
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,076
was a best selling author

200
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:08,276
who won the Naomoto Award when she was still young.

201
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,176
But last month she killed herself by slitting her wrist

202
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,487
at a Gunma hot spring inn, or so,

203
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,909
the freaking police said.

204
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,657
However, I swear it wasn't suicide.

205
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:23,109
She was killed by one of the three who went to the hot spring with her.

206
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,409
As for something that might be of evidence

207
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,665
I've brought it here.

208
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:31,809
So I want you to solve it, Sleeping Kogoro,

209
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,673
with your brilliant deduction.

210
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,609
Well, you don't have to worry.

211
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:41,609
Once the culprit is found, I'll kill the witch

212
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,209
and disappear to the other side myself as well.

213
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,209
What?

214
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:51,309
Although, there is a limit to how long I can stay awake.

215
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,309
Come tomorrow morning,

216
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,309
these bombs will go off, though.

217
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,309
What now?

218
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,579
So what the man wanted solved

219
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,707
was the truth behind the suicide of his sister,

220
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:12,279
mystery writer Miku Sawaguri?

221
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,979
What's more, that man has bombs on him,

222
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,179
and intends to commit murder-suicide with the culprit

223
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,779
once he finds out who, right?

224
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,379
Yes, that man also said...

225
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,279
that it'll explode in the morning,

226
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,979
so the bombs may be time bombs.

227
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:28,727
No way.

228
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:31,279
Ran is there too, isn't she?

229
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,731
Aren't they in big trouble?

230
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,779
Haibara, does it say online what hot spring inn it was

231
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,279
that Miku Sawaguri supposedly committed suicide at?

232
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,979
Yes, the date of the incident was last month on the 4th.

233
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:46,745
And there are photos of the three novelists who went there with her.

234
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
That inn...

235
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,479
It seems that man who's locked himself inside the detective agency

236
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,979
was also there as well.

237
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,579
"Isao Sawaguri (37)" -Since he, who was staying in the next room,

238
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,379
seem to have been the primary discoverer of the body.

239
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,679
He got an email from his sister saying goodbye,

240
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,763
thought it strange and went to knock on the door,

241
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,079
but received no response.

242
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,779
Without a choice, he broke the window via her balcony

243
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,769
and entered her room

244
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,079
to find that it had been enshrouded in steam.

245
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,179
And with her slit wrist soaked in the bathtub,

246
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,779
his sister was found dead holding tightly

247
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,179
onto her room key and cell phone,

248
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,379
according to his testimony.

249
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,179
The entrance door to the room was not an auto-lock type,

250
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,787
but the one that requires the turning of the key.

251
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:32,791
So basically it was a perfectly sealed room, wasn't it?

252
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,579
Then, why did that man insist it was a murder?

253
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:40,379
Could the name of the inn happen to be Furitsukaya?

254
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,379
Yes.

255
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,279
So it's the same hot spring inn the owner of Poirot went to

256
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,805
last month with people from the neighborhood association.

257
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:47,779
-What? -What?

258
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,179
Do you know who's in the neighborhood association?

259
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:54,179
Yes, because the owner sent me the photo

260
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,079
of everyone who was there back then.

261
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,817
Then, you guys go and find the people in the photo

262
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,819
except the owner, and ask about

263
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,479
what those three were up to before and after the incident.

264
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,479
-Yes. -Yes.

265
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:07,179
But, what about the owner?

266
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,827
The owner is in the coffee shop Poirot,

267
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,829
which is directly beneath the detective agency.

268
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,479
We'll call the police

269
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,379
to evacuate the owner and the customers,

270
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,279
so do not go anywhere near there no matter what.

271
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,837
But isn't she something?

272
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,379
Your girl at the detective agency.

273
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:23,879
She stuck her strap mascot in the cell phone

274
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,845
and then pretended that she'd hung up the phone

275
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,847
in order to keep the connection, right?

276
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,279
No, it wasn't Ran who did that.

277
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:35,379
Somehow that person is also at the detective agency,

278
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,779
the one we spoke about...

279
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,079
That detective named Sera.

280
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:45,979
All right, Kogoro Mouri.

281
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:49,879
Isn't it about time you enlighten me about the truth behind this case?

282
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,379
Which of the three people here killed my little sister?

283
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,879
But look here,

284
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,879
according to this copy of the newspaper,

285
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,479
the scene was a perfect sealed room.

286
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,479
What's more, the one who proved it was yourself,

287
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:06,885
the primary discoverer of the body.

288
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,279
Where are you getting that it was a murder?

289
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,379
I heard a sound.

290
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,579
When I found my sister passed out

291
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,479
and called an ambulance with my cell,

292
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,179
I heard a crunchy sound near the window.

293
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:20,579
So, I checked out the window,

294
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,579
and saw some small glass fragments

295
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,679
on the balcony outside of the window.

296
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,905
But I broke the glass of the window from the outside,

297
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,279
so isn't that weird?

298
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,909
That must be proof

299
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,879
that the culprit was hiding somewhere in the room,

300
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,479
waited until my attention was on my sister

301
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:40,079
and snuck out from that broken window.

302
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,679
But are you sure those fragments

303
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,679
weren't from your stepping on them before going outside the window?

304
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,679
Since you were in a rush to look around.

305
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,279
The police said the same thing,

306
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,935
but I know I never stepped outside the window back then.

307
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,879
Are you the type to act without considering the consequences

308
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,379
when things get intense?

309
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,945
Yes, my buddies often say that I'm a quick-tempered guy.

310
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:11,379
In that case, your deduction may not be completely off the mark.

311
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,779
For these ladies who knew about you,

312
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,955
could have taken advantage of your apparent personality.

313
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,579
Plus, just take a look.

314
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:21,579
The photo I took before the police came.

315
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,679
You see the bloody finger marks on the bathmat there

316
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,679
in front of the bathroom door?

317
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,679
Sure... looks to be so.

318
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,967
That's probably

319
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:30,969
since my sister had her wrist slit by the culprit in the bathroom,

320
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,679
and struggled with all her might to escape.

321
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,979
Thus, left these bloody marks.

322
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:38,079
Otherwise, how would the blood have gotten all the way over there.

323
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,479
But, to suspect those three just from that...

324
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,579
Before the incident occurred,

325
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,979
all three of them had been to my sister's room.

326
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:46,985
Isn't that right?

327
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
Yes.

328
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,879
Including Miku, the four of us had made a pact,

329
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,179
that the first person who hit one million sales

330
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,879
would treat the others to a hot spring trip.

331
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,379
Since it was Miku who had become a bestselling author.

332
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,279
We were hyping over SNS about how we might

333
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,279
as well have her sign the first edition books

334
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,279
she'd given us of her debut work at the inn.

335
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,979
That's why we each went to visit her at her room that day.

336
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,979
Though, it seems that the three of us

337
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,879
coincidentally missed each other in passing.

338
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:20,079
You've brought those books with you, no?

339
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,179
Yes.

340
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,379
Incidentally, how did you get them to bring those books here?

341
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,079
I lied to them about you and my sister being acquaintances.

342
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,379
Telling them that if they wanted to hear your stories,

343
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:33,979
they'd have to bring those books

344
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,679
as proof that they were my sister's close friends.

345
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,279
Here, take a look.

346
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,279
She even dated her autograph.

347
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,279
It's proof that these three met with my sister

348
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,279
on the date of the incident.

349
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:51,049
In addition, my sister posted live updates via SNS

350
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,679
of what was happening at the time.

351
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,179
Here's a copy of those postings.

352
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,879
However, if these people were all SNS buddies,

353
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,179
wouldn't they have seen those postings?

354
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:07,079
No, my sister used my ID to post them discreetly.

355
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,379
So that these people wouldn't see them.

356
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,279
That reminds me, when I went to her room.

357
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,479
She kept texting on the phone.

358
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,679
So she was actually posting?

359
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,879
Anyway, read it.

360
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,479
Let's see.

361
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,879
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

362
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,579
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

363
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,579
that pesky Elephant.

364
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,879
What is this Elephant?

365
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,479
My sister made a hobby out of comparing people to animals.

366
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,879
Just read on, will you?

367
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,879
Next to come was Fox.

368
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:41,099
Trying to stir up an argument again,

369
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,379
freaking annoying.

370
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:45,479
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

371
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:48,479
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

372
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,779
I'll make short work of the autograph

373
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,779
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

374
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,679
Darn, she's still here.

375
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,679
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

376
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,679
What should I do?

377
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,679
And it seems the postings end there.

378
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,779
So, you got it, right?

379
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,979
That my sister, who left such postings,

380
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,279
wouldn't have any reason to commit suicide.

381
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,579
And that one of these three here was the last to see my sister,

382
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,779
put her to sleep,

383
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,679
and kill her while making it look like suicide,

384
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,779
that goddamned Rat.

385
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,679
Elephant, Fox, and Rat?

386
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,379
We got to figure out the criteria the late Miku used

387
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,679
to assign those nicknames, or else.

388
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,679
If you want the profiles of those three novelists,

389
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,179
there are details along with their photos.

390
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,779
Are those three people that famous?

391
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,779
No, all three of them

392
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,179
merely upload novels online as a hobby,

393
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,161
and are amateurs who occasionally create a coterie magazine to sell.

394
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:46,879
They call themselves novelists uploaded websites,

395
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:48,679
that's why they were listed.

396
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,169
Tamae Mitsui is 41 years old,

397
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,171
never married, and has been helping

398
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:54,479
at her family's stone dealer's business.

399
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,879
She's a Taurus, blood type A.

400
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,979
Shinobu Yuchi is 36, and divorced once.

401
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,179
She's been working at her neighbourhood bakery

402
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,279
for close to 20 years, a Pisces, type B.

403
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,679
Sumika Nihei, age 39,

404
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,187
her husband is a seal cutting craftsman,

405
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:10,579
and in her spare time, as a housewife,

406
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,479
she writes mysteries, a Leo, type O.

407
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,779
Incidentally, I also looked up Miku's elder brother Sawaguri,

408
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:21,979
Turns out he was the leader of a survival games team,

409
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:24,679
the team's name is Green Cap.

410
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,207
A parody of the US Army's Special Forces Green Berets?

411
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,679
Just going by how these people look,

412
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,211
I'd say Elephant would be Mitsui,

413
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,479
Rat would be Yuchi,

414
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:37,215
and Fox would be Nihei, but...

415
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,579
It's too early to say for sure not a lot of info to go on.

416
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,221
As far as those three...

417
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,179
We've brought some answers.

418
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,579
The whole scoop!

419
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,379
You should be thankful to these children.

420
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,579
They bustled about the whole town in the Beetle, gathering info.

421
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,779
So, what'd you find out?

422
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:58,179
The lanky woman with the glasses is an extremely polite person.

423
00:20:58,179 --> 00:20:59,979
We heard that she willingly tidied up

424
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,239
after some kids she didn't know scattered shampoo

425
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,579
and conditioner here and there.

426
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:06,879
The short woman with the overbite loves hot springs.

427
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:10,579
It seems she went into the hot springs many times a day.

428
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,879
The most suspicious one is the fat woman.

429
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:18,179
She was rushing out of the dead lady's room with a pale face.

430
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,579
According to a guy who saw her from his slightly-opened door.

431
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,579
Was the guy who witnessed that

432
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,779
in the room directly opposite from the late Miku's?

433
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,779
No, he was in the room three rooms away

434
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,579
from hers on the same side.

435
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:33,079
When he was about to leave his room,

436
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,579
he said that woman ran towards him with a scary look,

437
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,579
so he immediately shut the door.

438
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:42,279
We even brought a picture of the commotion that happened after that.

439
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,079
We're told that it's a picture of when the police arrived to room 205,

440
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,279
the scene of the suicide.

441
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,379
So no one told this to the police?

442
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,579
Apparently people did,

443
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,979
but they were told by Inspector Yamamura

444
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,379
that since the scene is a sealed room, that is irrelevant.

445
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:58,079
That's right.

446
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,299
The Gunma Prefectural Police has that hack on the force.

447
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,879
Hey... why is this phone still connected?

448
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,679
Darn, he found out.

449
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,479
Darn.

450
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,311
Trying to play smart with me, little witch.

451
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,679
You've got quite the nerve.

452
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,979
You do know what's going to happen, right?

453
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,321
Hold it. It wasn't her, the one who did it was...

454
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:24,679
It was me.

455
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,479
I was the one who made her do it.

456
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:32,379
Shinichi Kudo did.

457
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,420
Next Conan's Hint:

458
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,423
"Bush warbler".

459
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,526
Excuse me, will you show me Sleeping Kogoro?

460
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:09,828
Well, let me see.

461
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,100
Don't know.
