Really?

Oh, yeah?

38
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:48,602
So, we were on a visit to Hiroshima

as guests in a travel program

40

What's the matter, Sonoko?

57
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:28,577
You said that you were going to join us here and yet...

58

I mean, are you still at home?

Well, you see,

60
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:35,077
I can't decide on what clothes to wear.

61
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:36,255
I wonder if I should wear

62
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,257
a maple patterned one-piece because it suits autumn?

63
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,577
Or, should I wear something more grown up like this one?

64
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:44,263
I think both of them look good on you.

We're sorry to have caused you worry.

70

We got him to take some medicine for now,

71
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,677
so I think that if he rests today, he'll be fine!

I guess we're leaving soon, so I'd better hang up.

You have to come along each time to the site.

No, no, I don't come along all the time.

Yeah, I guess you could say so.

entrance of Miyajima, Miyajimaguchi Station.

Since Miyajima itself is awed by many

00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,677
because of its many gods on land,

101

the shrine gates (torii) and shrines are built in the sea.

they say that you can walk over to the Great shrine gate (torii).

Salt?

When we were on air,

I left this drink together with our belongings over there.

127
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,577
Maybe it's a prank?

128
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:20,477
Isn't it going a little too far?

129

If I remember correctly,

130
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,177
I think Mr. Kamisuwa was near the things.

Hey, hey, cut it out.

132

Yeah. If I remember correctly, from about 2 weeks ago,

146

there's a guy that's been asking around about us.

147
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:15,977
I thought that the guy I saw a while ago looked like him.

148
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,537
That man came all the way from Hiroshima after the crew

149
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:21,577
and put salt into the canned coffee?

150
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:23,377

Moreover...

Although this is just a rumor,

there's talk of a worker at the station

They say that maple buns were first made here in Miyajima!

00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:16,595
What're the seven wonders of Misen?

169
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:19,077
It's a legend that's been handed down from the days of old about Misen

170
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,477
that stands tall in the center of Miyajima.

171
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,601
"Misen"

172
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:25,577
It includes the Kiezu no Hi (inextinguishable fire)

173
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,777
that is said to have never stopped burning

174
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,077
since Kobo-Daishi practiced asceticism.

175
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,577
The Shakujo no Ume (Tin Staff Plum Tree),

176
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:32,877
the tree on which the tin staff

177
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:35,677
that Kobo-Daishi is said to have leaned against, that took root.

178
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,277
The Kan Man Iwa (Ebb and Flow Rock)

179
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:39,477
in which the salt water that accumulates in a hole,

180
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,477
increases and decreases along with ebb and flow of the tide.

181
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:42,621
The Mandara Iwa (Mandala Rock)

182
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:46,625
in which the writing of Kobo-Daishi is carved on.

183
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,177
The Hyoshigi no Oto (Sound of the Wooden Clappers),

184
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:49,277
the sound of wooded clappers sounded

185
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:52,177
by the goblin that resides in Misen.

186
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:53,777
The Shidare Zakura (Dewy Cherry Blossoms)

187
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:56,277
that looks wet even on clear days with no rain.

188
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:58,977
The Ryuto no Sugi (Dragon Fire Cedar),

189
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:02,641
a mysterious light that appears in the sea of Miyajima

190
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,577
that can be seen from the mountain top of Misen.

191
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:09,477
These maple buns are of assorted flavours

192
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:11,477
that symbolize the 7 wonders of what I just mentioned.

193
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:12,977
I see.

194
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,977
This tastes like plum.

195
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,377
That's the Tin Staff Plum.

196
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:22,661
This is sakura sweet bean paste.

197
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,377
Dewy Cherry Blossom!

198
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,665
Inextinguishable Fire is a bit spicy hot!

199
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:28,177
Interesting!

200
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:31,077
Cut! Okay!

201
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:34,277
You're both pretty good!

202
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,177
Wow, Conan!

203
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:38,677
You may just be able to debut as a child star!

204
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,677
I've been playing the role of a child for quite a while already.

205
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:49,277
What's this?

206
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:51,377
My, how nostalgic!

207
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,377
-Have you been here before? -Yes.

208
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:56,477
I think it was in autumn two years ago.

209
00:11:56,477 --> 00:11:59,277
I came here on an interview for a different TV program.

210
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:01,577
Long time no see.

211
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:04,703
I heard that you were coming again, so I couldn't wait

212
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:08,077
and had it on display from 2 weeks ago.

213
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:12,711
This guy's... The one I saw a while ago!

214
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:13,977
Huh?

215
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,677
See, this guy!

216
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:17,977
"Shinroku Ayase (27)" -Isn't he the guy we saw a while ago?

217
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:20,719
Huh? Do you know my older brother?

218
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:24,723
Your older brother, Yayoi?

219
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:28,727
Your older brother's whereabouts

220
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,729
have been unknown since 2 weeks ago?

221
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:34,077
Yes. In fact, in autumn two years ago,

222
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:37,677
my parents entered the no trespassing area of Misen,

223
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:41,277
slipped and fell to their death.

224
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:47,277
But my older brother and I had doubts about their death.

225
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,277
That our parents who were used to Misen

226
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:52,277
wouldn't have fallen to their death.

227
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:55,477
My older brother investigated the area thoroughly

228
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,757
and found "it".

229
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,477
What's the "it"?

230
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:04,177
A glittering pretty accessory-like thing,

231
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,777
shaped like a flower.

232
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,277
About a half a month ago,

233
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:10,769
he said that he found out the identity of it,

234
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,277
and left home.

235
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:14,773
I haven't seen him since and can't get a hold of him either.

236
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,077
Mr. Mouri, I beg of you!

237
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:19,377
Could you please find my older brother?

238
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,577
Oh, yes.

239
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:24,577
I'm sorry, but we're pressed for time filming.

240
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:26,785
I see.

241
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,787
Why would your older brother

242
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,177
want to hang around the crew of Nichiuri TV?

243
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,577
Wait a sec. In autumn two years ago...

244
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:36,577
If I remember correctly,

245
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:40,377
Mr. Koshiji and the others were here in Miyajima.

246
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:42,277
Maybe this is connected with the accident

247
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:43,777
that happened here 2 years ago.

248
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:48,807
"Senjokaku"

249
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,477
Strange.

250
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:55,677
What's wrong?

251
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:58,477
Well, it's a call from Miyake,

252
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:02,821
but I don't remember setting such a strange ringtone.

253
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:05,577
Is this the sound of wooden clappers?

254
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:07,977
Why don't you try answering?

255
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,877
Okay.

256
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:13,877
Hello, Miyake?

257
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:17,777
What's up? Answer me.

258
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,477
Hello?

259
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,777
Where on earth is Ms. Miyake?

260
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,977
Time wise I don't think she is somewhere too far.

261
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,877
Ms. Miyake! Are you all right?

262
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,177
I'm glad, she's not all that badly hurt.

263
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,177
This is...

264
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,873
Are you all right?

265
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:58,140
Yes, it's no big deal.

266
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,240
Why were you in a place like that?

267
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,840
That person...

268
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,883
I saw somebody that resembled Yayoi's older brother, so I...

269
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,340
What? My older brother?

270
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,887
I went after him,

271
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,840
and suddenly the stone from a stone fence came falling...

272
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,893
Putting salt in canned coffee is not that serious,

273
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,240
but this is going a bit too far.

274
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,340
It's the same, isn't it?

275
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,540
-With the seven wonders. -Huh?

276
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,740
Audio man Mr. Yatsukawa's coffee

277
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,140
was spoiled with salt poured into it.

278
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,440
The sound of wooden clappers that was set as the ringtone

279
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,911
before he noticed anything had been changed.

280
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,240
The thing that hurt Ms. Miyake, in charge of make-up

281
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,540
was a blotched stone.

282
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,540
They are each objects of the 7 Wonders of Misen.

283
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,140
The Ebb and Flow Rock,

284
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,040
the sound of the wooden clappers,

285
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,640
and the Mandala Rock. Don't they all match?

286
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,840
True!

287
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,340
It's amazing that you noticed, sonny!

288
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,440
Stay out of it, kid.

289
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,340
That's only three out of seven!

290
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,440
It's just a coincidence, understand? A coincidence!

291
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,540
I wonder about that. There could be more.

292
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,940
They are!

293
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,040
Assistant Producer, Mr. Kitayama's necktie,

294
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,540
the pattern on it is the Dewy Cherry Blossoms, right?

295
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,040
Now that you mentioned it.

296
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,340
Yeah, it was of bad taste that was out of season.

297
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,540
One more of the 7 Wonders,

298
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,240
Dewy Cherry Blossoms!

299
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Then, maybe...

300
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,440
And his stomachache...

301
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,740
It could've been caused by somebody too?

302
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,540
By somebody...

303
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,140
Do you mean Yayoi's older brother?

304
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,040
Oh, no.

305
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,973
If so, but why us?

306
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,440
You have no idea as to why?

307
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Maybe you should also go ask Mr. Kitamura?

308
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,440
I know.

309
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,340
Mr. Kamisuwa.

310
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,240
He's not answering.

311
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I wonder if he's sleeping?

312
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,997
Just to be safe, let's have the hotel staff go check on him.

313
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,840
I see. So he's asleep after all.

314
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,009
Then, please leave him a message to call us when he gets up.

315
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,940
Thank you so very much.

316
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,440
There are three 7 wonders left.

317
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,340
Is something else going to happen yet?

318
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,840
And, besides that guy...

319
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,023
Is Yayoi's older brother really involved?

320
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,025
Wait a sec.

321
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,029
Her older brother disappeared two weeks ago and...

322
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,033
That photo was also placed there two weeks ago.

323
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,035
Maybe...

324
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,940
Her older brother saw the picture and...

325
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,140
What shall we do, Mr. Kamisuwa?

326
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,640
What's scheduled today?

327
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,140
After this, we go over to Daishoin and that's it!

328
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,540
Then, filming is priority.

329
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,340
We'll talk about this again tonight or something.

330
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,053
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri,

331
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,640
but I hope that's okay with you.

332
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,540
Okay.

333
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,040
Okay, let's move it then!

334
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,059
Yes, sir!

335
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,140
"Daishoin"

336
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,740
Cut!

337
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,040
Okay, all done!

338
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,081
Thanks for all the work, everyone!

339
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,540
We've only got one more scene to go today!

340
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
There's something about those two.

341
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,540
I'd better keep my eyes on them.

342
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,093
"Kannon Hall"

343
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,540
Next, is the mental training in the dark

344
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,097
that helps get rid of the sins of this world,

345
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,099
climbing the "Ordination Platform"!

346
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,840
Ran, Conan, we're counting on you!

347
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Huh, you mean we're going in here all by ourselves?

348
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm not too comfortable with things like this.

349
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,109
Rather, this is bad,

350
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,040
because I'm not going to be able to watch those two.

351
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,640
Hey, you're a boy, don't be a panty!

352
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,140
Go on, go on!

353
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,040
Give it all you got, Ran!

354
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,440
Come on, inside, inside!

355
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,540
Hey, Conan.

356
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,140
Don't go without me.

357
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,129
Let's go together, Conan.

358
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,040
We're finally outside.

359
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,137
That's all for today.

360
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:22,240
We'll see you again tomorrow!

361
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,040
Thank you so very much.

362
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,340
Huh? Where are Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji?

363
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,140
Somebody, come here!

364
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,840
What was that?

365
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,640
Mr. Kamisuwa?

366
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,040
Mr. Koshiji!

367
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,240
This is...

368
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,940
Mr. Koshiji!

369
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,440
He's still breathing.

370
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,340
Mr. Yatsukawa, call an ambulance!

371
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,440
Fire... He was there...

372
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,940
What?

373
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,940
Fire? He was there?

374
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,740
Who was there?

375
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,640
-The culprit? -What?

376
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Mr. Koshiji, once more!

377
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,640
No good, he passed out.

378
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,940
This is...

379
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,740
The strap of his cell phone is...

380
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,201
the tin staff!

381
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:27,205
A small replica of the Tin Staff Plum, one of the 7 wonders?

382
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,207
Did the culprit drop it?

383
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,940
It's him.

384
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,211
Huh?

385
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:37,215
I saw the guy we saw in the afternoon run off beyond.

386
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,640
Why didn't you say so sooner?

387
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,940
Don't tell me he's planning to flee on the ferry.

388
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,239
Will I make it?

389
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,243
-Excuse me! -I'm sorry!

390
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,740
Where's the ferry?

391
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,440
Too late?

392
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Hey, that!

393
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,269
It's that guy!

394
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,640
Darn it! We almost got him!

395
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,540
Big trouble! Misenya's on fire!

396
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,277
What?

397
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,840
Fire, the shop, eh?

398
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,540
Somebody! Somebody!

399
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,293
-Did you bring water? -Hurry up!

400
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,295
-Yayoi! -Are you all right?

401
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,297
Yes.

402
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,340
Kitamura?

403
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,307
Mr. Kamisuwa, I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.

404
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,309
This is no time for something like that right now.

405
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,040
Koshiji's been attacked and Misenya's on fire.

406
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Huh? Mr. Koshiji's been attacked?

407
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,840
A fire? What's going on?

408
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,319
Mr. Kitamura who's resting at a hotel in Hiroshima...

409
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,040
Mr. Kamisuwa! This is bad!

410
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,340
Just before the fire broke out,

411
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,540
the people of the neighborhood seem to have seen

412
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,640
someone who resembled her older brother.

413
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,440
What?

414
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,856
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,974
"High rise condominium"

416
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:07,716
Okay, dig in to oysters and conger eels!

417
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:08,888
Dad, what about the case?

418
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:11,429
Just get me beer first of all!

419
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,071
Hey, hey.
