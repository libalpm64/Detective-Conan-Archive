1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:05,629
Huh? You got a letter from a dead person?

2
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,429
-For Heiji? -Yeah.

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,129
That person is my mother's acquaintance.

4
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,729
A person named Wakamatsu

5
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,995
who is the president of a design company in Tokyo.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,429
I've met him several times before too,

7
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:23,129
but it seems he was killed at a villa in Karuizawa.

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,005
-Killed? -Yeah.

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,129
But it just so happened that

10
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:30,029
we were having a birthday party for Mr. Wakamatsu's wife

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,011
that day at the villa.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,129
The local police seems to think that

13
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:37,329
a robber who broke into the villa encountered Mr. Wakamatsu,

14
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,529
and as a result ended up killing him.

15
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:44,029
But, why would he send you a letter, Heiji?

16
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:47,329
Don't tell me that he sent it out before he was killed?

17
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,329
No.

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,029
That letter is post marked 10 days after the crime,

19
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,429
so I don't think he's the one who sent it out.

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,629
The name of the sender is Kohei Wakamatsu,

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,229
but the contents of the letter

22
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,629
seems to have been written by the culprit who killed him.

23
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,729
-The culprit? -Yeah.

24
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,429
This is what is written in the letter.

25
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:09,429
"Dear Heiji Hattori.

26
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:12,929
I would like to see you, Mr. High School Detective

27
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:16,629
and confess the crime that I have committed.

28
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:18,729
But, even if I were to meet you,

29
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,429
I feel slightly doubtful whether you'd be able to visibly see me or not.

30
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:26,629
Why? Because I am a warped entity

31
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,329
that you people have made up on your own.

32
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,629
I'm an illusionary figure

33
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:32,071
that one cannot visibly see under normal circumstances.

34
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,829
Despite this, if you'd still like to see me,

35
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,929
I'll be waiting for you at the residence of the man

36
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:40,079
that I have killed during the night of the next full moon.

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,729
And, at the end of the letter,

38
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,729
Mr. Wakamatsu's address in Osaka is written."

39
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,429
And along with...

40
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,093
the key of the house was inside, too!

41
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,729
If all cases were men,

42
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,117
all hidden mysteries are women.

43
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,119
Heiji receives a letter and a key.

44
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,121
The mystery of the word that is carved on the tile!

45
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,929
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,729
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,929
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:57,966
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Eye)"

49
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,066
And?

50
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,221
Did you go to the house

51
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,223
where that ghost-like guy was waiting for you?

52
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,566
Of course I was planning to go and disclose his identity.

53
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,566
But I caught a cold.

54
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:12,231
Then she, without my permission took the key.

55
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,566
I went there in your place, Heiji!

56
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,235
-What? -You mean you went to

57
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,237
the haunted house all by yourself, Kazuha?

58
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:21,266
No. I took three friends along with me!

59
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,241
I persuaded them to come

60
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,243
saying that it was a game to test their courage.

61
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:27,366
Besides, it wasn't anything like a haunted house!

62
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:28,766
It seems that the late president

63
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:32,251
used to return to the house when he came back to Osaka.

64
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,566
The house was clean and neat, too.

65
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,766
The electricity was usable, too.

66
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:40,266
And? Was somebody waiting at that house?

67
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,266
Nope, there was no answer when we rang the doorbell.

68
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,466
So having no choice, I opened the door using the key

69
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,866
that I had with me and went inside,

70
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,466
but it was really fancy inside.

71
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,766
So although we went there thinking that

72
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,266
we were going to be testing our courage,

73
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,666
it turned out to be a visit to a gorgeous villa!

74
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,066
We decided to check out what the bath room looked like

75
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,566
and went to see it.

76
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,166
You took a look and?

77
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,866
An eerie looking long-haired person

78
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,966
was leaning against the wall of the bath room and sitting down!

79
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,287
What?

80
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,289
Did you talk to that person?

81
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,266
Before I even got a chance to talk to that person,

82
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,266
the lights went out.

83
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,966
I was talking over with my friends

84
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,566
whether we should call the police or not.

85
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,766
Then, we heard an eerie rustling noise.

86
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:25,066
We got scared and decided to leave the house right away then,

87
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,966
the lights suddenly turned back on.

88
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:30,566
And the person who there a moment ago was gone!

89
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,366
I'm sure the guy got away

90
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,466
after turning the lights off with remote control or something.

91
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,866
Well, if he's the only one who disappeared,

92
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,321
I wouldn't have come all the way to Tokyo!

93
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,066
There was a letter left behind at the bath room

94
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,866
where the guy disappeared.

95
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,166
A letter?

96
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,966
This is what seems to have been typed by a word processor.

97
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,266
"The only thing that disappeared is your physical body

98
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,666
and not the words!"

99
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,337
Words? What do you mean?

100
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,966
On the tile wall that the guy was leaning against, near his head,

101
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,866
it seems that there was a carving by a knife of something.

102
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,166
-Isn't that right? -Yep.

103
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,266
It was written in three letter of the alphabet.

104
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:12,866
Spelled "E-Y-E" was written largely!

105
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,366
E-Y-E?

106
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,357
Eye.

107
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,766
Eye...

108
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,361
Those letters disappeared along with the person,

109
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,566
and yet on the piece of paper it was written

110
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,466
that the word didn't disappear.

111
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:29,066
Then, maybe the tile was switched with a tile

112
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,366
from another place where there was no carving?

113
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:35,266
There were a lot of scratches on the bottom part of the tile wall.

114
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,766
Although I thought the same thing at first...

115
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:38,766
As for that tile,

116
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,066
the more you go from the top of the wall to below,

117
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,066
the color gradually got paler.

118
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,066
So if you switched the top tiles to those below,

119
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,666
it'd be obvious because the color would be different!

120
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,966
Did you go to see the tile too, Heiji?

121
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,166
Yeah.

122
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,395
But that house was scheduled for rebuilding construction from that day

123
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,266
and there were a lot of workers there.

124
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,666
They wouldn't let me inside the house.

125
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,666
Then, how long were the lights out in that house?

126
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,366
I think it lasted only less than 5 minutes.

127
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:12,166
If so, maybe a tile of the same color as the one

128
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,366
with the word carved on it was prepared beforehand.

129
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,266
I guess it'd be appropriate to think that

130
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:19,066
the guy switched the tiles in the dark

131
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:22,766
and took the tile with the word on it away with him.

132
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,866
But, why try such a stupid trick?

133
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,666
It's only natural to think that way, right?

134
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,429
But now we're getting to the main issue.

135
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,166
Mr. Wakamatsu who was stabbed to death in Karuizawa

136
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,866
was also found in a bath room with the same kind of tile,

137
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,437
but when he was first found,

138
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:42,441
there was a dying message that he had written in his own blood.

139
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,866
However, it seems when the police got there, it was gone.

140
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,066
A dying message disappeared?

141
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,766
There was blood on Mr. Wakamatsu's fingers

142
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,366
and it's obvious that he had written something,

143
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:57,166
so don't you think it's strange?

144
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,266
Could it be that the culprit who noticed it,

145
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,666
snuck back and wiped it off?

146
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,463
If so, there luminol reaction should've been found from the tiles

147
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,766
around Mr. Wakamatsu's fingers, right?

148
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,666
Then, maybe like the person that Kazuha and her friends saw,

149
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,471
the tiles were switched with ones that had no blood on them?

150
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,866
Well, just at that time,

151
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:17,866
Mr. Wakamatsu was in the midst of redoing the tiles himself,

152
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:20,479
and the glue didn't seem to have dried completely yet.

153
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,166
So, the tiles could've been switched.

154
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,266
But there it was the same as what Kazuha saw,

155
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,487
and the tiles gradually got paler towards the bottom.

156
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:32,491
So, if they were switched, it would be readily visible.

157
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:36,495
If that culprit erased the word using the same trick that Kazuha saw,

158
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,466
-wouldn't that be of concern? -Yes! It would!

159
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:43,566
So, I had Mom get me to go to Mr. Wakamatsu's main house in Tokyo

160
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,766
to ask about the incident,

161
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,466
but would you guy like to come along too?

162
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,666
Then, can I come along too?

163
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,066
Sorry, I promised that only five of us would go!

164
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,515
What?

165
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,666
It's better for you this way, right?

166
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,366
Sort of.

167
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,166
-Shoots. -Sorry about that.

168
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:08,866
My...

169
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:12,531
So, you're Shizuka's son, Heiji?

170
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,533
Is this the first time we've met?

171
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,766
Yeah.

172
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:19,566
My husband's always told me about you.

173
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:22,966
He used to say that you're really sharp despite your age.

174
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,466
He said that you're probably a good match

175
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,547
with another high school detective called Shinichi Kudo!

176
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:36,266
Well, if you ask me, this famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

177
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:39,866
their battle is like the kettle calling the black pot!

178
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,066
Hey, is dinner ready yet?

179
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,366
Ikuro.

180
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,366
I'm famished and on the verge of starving to death,

181
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:50,266
where's dinner?

182
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,266
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,573
The housekeeper went out to get some soy sauce,

184
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,575
so wait a little while more, okay?

185
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,566
Then, tell her this when she gets back!

186
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:02,366
To give me a bigger serving of dinner than the others!

187
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:06,366
-Is he your son? -Yes.

188
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,166
But I'm his step-mother, you see.

189
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,591
We remarried.

190
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,966
Oh? Guests?

191
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,166
He's the detective I told you about the other day

192
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,266
and his company.

193
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,266
I see.

194
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:25,366
But so many...

195
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,866
Is anything wrong?

196
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,366
Oh, no.

197
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:32,611
I bought some baumkuchen that's the president's favorite,

198
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,613
but I don't think there are enough pieces.

199
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,615
I guess it'll be fine,

200
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:40,619
because the president's dead and not here anymore.

201
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,621
I tasted a bit of it a while ago,

202
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,066
so I don't want any either.

203
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,966
Hey, Fujinami!

204
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:48,266
Uh, who are these people?

205
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,366
This is Mr. Masashige Shiina,

206
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,631
the head of our business affairs office

207
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,635
and chief designer, Mr. Sumio Fujinami!

208
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,166
Is Ms. Satake here?

209
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,366
Oh, yes.

210
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:03,666
Ikuro seems to be annoyed because he's hungry.

211
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,266
I think having some baumkuchen may calm him down,

212
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,966
so could you serve us some tea?

213
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,666
Sure.

214
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,066
Will the Prince of Wales brand

215
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:14,653
that the president used to like be all right?

216
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,266
Yes, that'll be fine.

217
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:19,266
I'll do so right away, ma'am.

218
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,659
Who is that woman?

219
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,266
She's Ms. Yoshimi Satake,

220
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,066
who used to be my husband's secretary.

221
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,266
But she works as my secretary now.

222
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:31,066
Since everyone who was at the villa

223
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,066
when my husband died is here except for the housekeeper,

224
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:38,066
so shall we talk over the day of the incident in the living room?

225
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,966
Did your husband like to do Sunday carpentry?

226
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:47,866
Yes. That's why despite my birthday party that day,

227
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:51,366
he said since they were tiles that he designed himself

228
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:53,866
and special ordered that he wanted to redo it himself.

229
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:56,366
Well, I don't think that president even imagined

230
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,266
something like that would happen to him, though.

231
00:11:58,266 --> 00:11:59,966
Mr. Fujinami!

232
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,666
Yes, siree.

233
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,166
And, who first discovered his body?

234
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,966
That was...

235
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,366
Me!

236
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,466
I went to the bath room thinking to help master,

237
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:14,713
and found him lying on the floor smeared with blood.

238
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,166
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,766
I heard voices, so...

240
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,866
She's the housekeeper, Ms. Yonehara.

241
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:23,566
Then, you're the one who also saw the dying message in question?

242
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,366
Yes, sir.

243
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:28,066
And? What was written?

244
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,729
If you saw it before it disappeared, you remember, don't you?

245
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,466
Yes. If I remember correctly, it was written in alphabet.

246
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,866
Enough of that already!

247
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,166
It's going to spoil the taste of the baumkuchen!

248
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,739
Come on, cut it for me, will you?

249
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,741
Yes, sir.

250
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,743
I'm the one who should be doing the cutting!

251
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,745
Then, you cut the pieces, Ms. Yonehara.

252
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:47,966
And I'll put them on the plate.

253
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,766
-More than that... -Yes.

254
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:52,751
Since all the major members of the company are here,

255
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:55,566
let's talk about the next would-be president!

256
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,366
Right now, Mom,

257
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:02,761
the vice-president is serving as temporary substitute president,

258
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:06,765
but how about jumping a flight of stairs and appointing me as president?

259
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,466
Although I'm just an ordinary employee now,

260
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,366
I'm going to eventually take after my Dad

261
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,266
and become the president.

262
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:18,266
That's right, isn't it, Mother?

263
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,779
Yes.

264
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,566
No problem, then!

265
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:26,566
Make me president!

266
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:30,366
That's most likely what my late Dad wants too.

267
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,366
Hey! Don't eat it before it's put on the plate.

268
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:38,166
Idiot! Eating it like this is...

269
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:52,811
Ikuro!

270
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,813
Ikuro!

271
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,815
Don't move!

272
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,966
Until I, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri tell you it's okay,

273
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:02,266
don't anybody move!

274
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,666
But...

275
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,825
these two young men have already...

276
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,366
No good. He's already dead.

277
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,829
-What? -What?

278
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,666
It seems to be a cyanide hydrogen type of toxin.

279
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,833
Which means that

280
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,837
it could've been in the baumkuchen that he ate a while ago.

281
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,366
Ran and the others!

282
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:23,166
Don't eat the baumkuchen that was served a while ago, okay?

283
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,843
Yeah.

284
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,466
Kazuha, get on the phone!

285
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,266
-And call the police? -Yeah!

286
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,166
Tell them that the idiot who had the nerve to kill a person

287
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,166
right in front of a detective is here!

288
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,850
The victim is Ikuro Wakamatsu, age 25.

289
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,850
He's the son of company president Kyohei Wakamatsu

290
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,450
of a design company who died last month in Karuizawa.

291
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,871
Is that correct?

292
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,873
Yes.

293
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,650
But, just when was the poison put into the baumkuchen?

294
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,650
I don't know when,

295
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,350
but it seems that the poison was put into a capsule.

296
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,450
-Huh? -See.

297
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,250
There's a capsule like thing at the bottom of the teacup!

298
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,889
Though it's pretty melted.

299
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,750
The culprit probably cracked the capsule

300
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,450
and sprinkled the poison onto the baumkuchen,

301
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,899
and while we were distracted by the corpse,

302
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,250
he sunk the capsule into the teacup.

303
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,650
Once it melts, you can't get fingerprints from it.

304
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,950
Which means that

305
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,550
the person who was near the teacup is the culprit?

306
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,350
But when everyone was told to stay away from the corpse,

307
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,350
everybody gathered over to this table.

308
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,250
So anybody who was in this room at that time

309
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,450
could've put the capsule with the poison inside the cup, no?

310
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,450
It... It's not me!

311
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,450
I didn't go near the baumkuchen even once.

312
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,450
Moreover, that teacup is mine.

313
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,935
Then, who cut the baumkuchen into divided pieces?

314
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,850
I'm the one who cut it.

315
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,250
As for putting the pieces on the plate,

316
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,750
I had Ms. Satake help me.

317
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,945
I cut the baumkuchen into 8 pieces as she told me.

318
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,947
Divide into eight?

319
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,650
I wanted it divided into eight because there are 5 guests,

320
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,250
Mrs. Wakamatsu, and her son Ikuro.

321
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,957
Plus Mr. Shiina, the managing director who loves sweets.

322
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,950
The managing director's the one who bought the baumkuchen,

323
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,750
and I thought that if we cut it into more pieces,

324
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,550
the pieces would be too small.

325
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,450
So you're the one who bought it?

326
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,950
Yes, sir.

327
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,550
The late president and I loved the baumkuchen of that shop,

328
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,975
so I always bring it along when I come here.

329
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,350
I had Mr. Fujinami stop by

330
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,650
at the shop on our way here by car today, too.

331
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,981
Come to think of it,

332
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,750
you were saying that you picked on the baumkuchen, didn't you?

333
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,650
I just took a really small piece!

334
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,350
I was in the car and waiting in front of the cake shop

335
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,650
when the managing director handed me the box of baumkuchen

336
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,050
saying that he forgot to get the receipt

337
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,650
and went back into the shop.

338
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,001
So, I just got a bit playful while waiting

339
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,003
-and picked on a little piece. -Right!

340
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,350
Mine was a little broken off!

341
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,550
In other words,

342
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,850
you could've sprinkled poison on the entire baumkuchen?

343
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,250
Then, are you saying that the poison

344
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,250
was sprinkled on the entire baumkuchen,

345
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,850
and that Ikuro just happened to eat it before the others?

346
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,850
No, it was a logical consequence!

347
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,550
It seems that Ikuro was really hungry, you see.

348
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,027
But even if it were to be so,

349
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,550
it wouldn't be necessary to drop the capsule into the teacup then.

350
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,550
-It's fake! -Fake?

351
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,050
It was set to make it look as if the poison was sprinkled on here,

352
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,550
so that the one who couldn't come near the baumkuchen

353
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,050
wouldn't be suspected.

354
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,450
Isn't that right?

355
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,850
If so, would I from my side go

356
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,550
and tell you that I picked on it?

357
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,950
Besides, after we got here and I was parking the car into the garage,

358
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,350
the managing director took the baumkuchen into the house first,

359
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,050
so he also had the chance to lace it with poison.

360
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,059
In the first place,

361
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,650
we didn't know that the stupid brat was hungry,

362
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,350
so why would we do something as crazy as

363
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,750
to sprinkle poison over the entire baumkuchen?

364
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,550
I mean, if someone else ate it first,

365
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,550
that person would die, right?

366
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,075
By the way, why was Ikuro so hungry?

367
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,850
I went out to buy soy sauce that we ran out of,

368
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,350
so dinner was delayed.

369
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,150
Who else knew that he was hungry?

370
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,950
The secretary Ms. Satake, Ms. Yonehara the housekeeper,

371
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,950
and I could've all figured out that he was hungry, no?

372
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,650
Yes.

373
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,650
If I remember correctly, Ikuro grabbed 1 piece of baumkuchen

374
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,350
out of the two that were on the tray and ate it.

375
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,650
-But does he always eat like that? -Yes.

376
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,350
He says that it tastes better that way.

377
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,103
So he doesn't use a fork even when he eats shortcake.

378
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,105
Don't tell me that somebody who wanted

379
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,250
to make Ikuro who was greedy over food,

380
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,550
take a big piece, cut a bit piece

381
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,950
and sprinkled poison on that piece?

382
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,450
I cut it into 8 even pieces!

383
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,850
The pieces that I served all of you

384
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,117
were cut into same size pieces, weren't they?

385
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:02,150
At any rate, we're going to be checking

386
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,123
the left-over baumkuchen and teacups in detail from now,

387
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,550
so after you're done having your body checked,

388
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,250
please wait in another room.

389
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,650
But, what shall I do?

390
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,135
The deadline for the orders of the designs we received

391
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,550
is at the end of this month,

392
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,350
and yet after what happened to Ikuro...

393
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,850
At this rate, I guess we won't be able to go home tonight.

394
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,150
No joke.

395
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,450
And I've still got unfinished work to take care of.

396
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,149
I also have a document

397
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,550
that I need you to sign and seal, vice-president.

398
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,750
And I sent the characters, colors and designs

399
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,157
that were chosen to the computer here,

400
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,159
but did you take a look at it?

401
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,750
I told you to print things like that out

402
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,450
and then show it to me, didn't I?

403
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,050
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,550
The president used to tell me to do so, that's why I...

405
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,650
The computer here has a different operating system from mine,

406
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,850
so I can't use it.

407
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,350
Well, I'll look at it on the monitor together

408
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,850
with the managing director later,

409
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,177
so let me know which file it is!

410
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,250
-Yes, ma'am. -Talking of the president...

411
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,340
What that stupid son of his said a while ago, was he serious?

412
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,850
About him taking over the company eventually

413
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,750
because he was blood related to the president?

414
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,750
-I was also surprised. -Me too.

415
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,250
I wonder... I think he just believed that it would be so.

416
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,950
Either way, I had no intention

417
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,201
to work under that stupid son, so thank God.

418
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,850
Hey, you guys!

419
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,950
Please, that's enough!

420
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,450
A person has passed away, you know!

421
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,850
It's true that Ikuro wasn't much liked by everyone,

422
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,850
but it's a fact that he was killed by someone!

423
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,450
Moreover, the one who killed him could be among us, do you get it?

424
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,550
Will you all please be more considerate of

425
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,221
the situation that we're under right now?

426
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,650
Do you understand the situation at all?

427
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,227
Serving everyone tea again

428
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,229
when somebody was poisoned to death.

429
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,233
I served the tea while the officer was looking on!

430
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:58,350
If you still think that there's poison in it, don't drink it!

431
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,550
Why you...

432
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,241
We were only part way through that story in question.

433
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,350
The story in question?

434
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,250
The one about the case last month where the president was killed

435
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,650
and found in the bath room of his villa in Karuizawa.

436
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,450
You were the first one to find him, weren't you?

437
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,250
Yes.

438
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,255
Back then, there should've been a dying message

439
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,850
that the president wrote with his own blood.

440
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,250
But when the police got there, it was gone, right?

441
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,750
If I remember correctly,

442
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,250
you said that you remember that word that disappeared.

443
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,450
I remember you said something about it being an alphabet.

444
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,550
Don't tell me that the alphabets were...

445
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,950
"E-Y-E"?

446
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,950
E-Y-E?

447
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,350
It's probably referring to "eyes"!

448
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,850
I saw it, too!

449
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,350
I was contacted by the culprit who said he killed the president,

450
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,850
who told me to come to the president's residence in Osaka.

451
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,650
That's when I saw the eerie three letters that disappeared!

452
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,450
My... At that house in Osaka?

453
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,050
That's why we came all the way out here to hear more about it.

454
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,550
But, what I saw was...

455
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,750
the alphabet "S"!

456
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,750
There seemed to be continuation of something else,

457
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,250
but it covered by his hand and I couldn't see it.

458
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,150
"S", was it?

459
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,950
Hey! Hold it!

460
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,550
The managing director Mr. Masashige Shiina

461
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,313
as well as Chief designer Mr. Masuo Fujinami,

462
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,315
the secretary Ms. Yoshiimi Satake,

463
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,550
and the president's wife Mrs. Serika Wakamatsu,

464
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,950
all have either names or last names

465
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,850
starting with the letter "S"!

466
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,329
My name is Sakurako, so it also starts with "S".

467
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:32,850
What?

468
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,050
The dying message that disappeared...

469
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,750
The letter "S" written with blood,

470
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,450
what on earth are they indicating?

471
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

472
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,423
"Tile"
