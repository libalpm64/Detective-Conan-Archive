1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,370
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,470
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,970
The mystery of the samurai in the suit of armor is solved,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,170
Sadness is behind the legend.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,330
We were headed for the hot springs

9
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,330
but a heavy snowfall closes the road

10
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,130
and we end up staying at the Daimon residence.

11
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,330
When we get up the next morning,

12
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,330
we learn that the head of the household,

13
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,030
Genichiro Daimon has been found dead in the annex.

14
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,030
And then the eldest son, Kazuki

15
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,330
is found in the audio room wearing a suit of armor,

16
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,130
dead under strange circumstances.

17
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,630
"Frightening Legend On A Snowy Night (Part 2)"

18
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,030
The wound is the same as Genichiro's,

19
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,030
a single thrust with a sharp object.

20
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,230
I believe it was with this sword.

21
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,830
It's true. It's Hidetomo's curse, after all.

22
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,030
That suit of armor summoned Hidetomo's spirit

23
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,730
to punish my husband for all his dishonest dealings

24
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,830
and Kazuki in the main house, too.

25
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,930
And to show us it was the curse,

26
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,730
he put the suit of armor on Kazuki.

27
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,230
I can't prove if it was a curse or not

28
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,930
but those footprints are for real.

29
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,830
The only footprints leading from the annex to the main house

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,030
are those from the warrior in the suit of armor.

31
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,430
Which means...

32
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,930
Do you really think it was the warrior the suit of armor?

33
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,730
At any rate, we've got to call the police.

34
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,930
I want everyone to wait in the living room

35
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,630
until the police arrive.

36
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,330
I'll go and prepare some coffee.

37
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,430
-Now's my chance. -No, you don't!

38
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,630
Dad is going to be angry.

39
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,630
But...

40
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,430
Hatsuho! We'll help you.

41
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,230
We'll be waiting, please hurry.

42
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,730
The police won't be able to get here right away

43
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,530
because of the heavy snow.

44
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,130
I see.

45
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,330
Yoshiro.

46
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,330
You're the only one who can protect this family now.

47
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,030
Mother.

48
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,530
I wonder who could have killed father and Kazuki.

49
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,730
What is that stain?

50
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,530
Blood? From the murder scene?

51
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,930
No.

52
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,330
There's only one possibility.

53
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,630
Kazuki killed Genichiro in the annex

54
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,530
then returned to the audio room and committed suicide.

55
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,230
Why would Kazuki do such a thing?

56
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,430
He had a good reason, didn't he?

57
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,730
Kazuki criticized father's methods

58
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,430
and they were always fighting!

59
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,830
Maybe he got carried away and...

60
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,630
That sounds just like the legend of the suit of armor.

61
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,830
What about you, Yoshiro?

62
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,130
You came back to settle things with father, didn't you?

63
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,630
It applies to you, too.

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,930
Maybe all that talk about becoming a guitarist was a lie

65
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,630
and what you really wanted was

66
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,430
to become president of Daimon Industries.

67
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,630
If father and Kazuki were out of the way,

68
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,230
you'd be guaranteed the position, wouldn't you?

69
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,330
What utter nonsense!

70
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,530
How did I get to the annex in the first place?

71
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,530
There were no footprints leading from the main house.

72
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,030
Well, the same goes for Kazuki, too.

73
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,430
It's true that there were only

74
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,330
footprints leading from the annex to the main house.

75
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,030
It's the curse.

76
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,030
The armor clad warrior walked from the annex

77
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,130
to the main house in the middle of the night,

78
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,930
I saw it with my own eyes.

79
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,530
Perhaps you were dreaming, mother.

80
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,930
I was not dreaming!

81
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,830
I saw it with my own eyes. I know I did.

82
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,530
The huge form of the warrior in the suit of armor

83
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,530
walked under the moonlight.

84
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,530
Excuse me, madam. Was the warrior carrying a sword?

85
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,530
Let me see.

86
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,030
I don't think he had a sword.

87
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,030
Maybe it was in his right hand though.

88
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,630
Gosh. What a stupid question.

89
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,130
There's two problems.

90
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,330
How did Genichiro's killer get to the annex

91
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,730
without leaving any footprints?

92
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,330
And why did the killer head for the audio room?

93
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,730
I see! I've figured it out!

94
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,230
I don't understand what everybody's talking about.

95
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,230
I'm going outside to play in the snow.

96
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,730
Hey! You stay right here!

97
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,130
What the heck are you thinking about at a time like this?

98
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,330
That's enough!

99
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,430
Gosh. How many times do I have tell you not to wander around?

100
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,830
Good.

101
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,130
Look, Pops. My footprints are gone.

102
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,530
I wonder why?

103
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,430
What? You're talking nonsense!

104
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,430
Maybe that's what happened.

105
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,530
Now's my chance.

106
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,830
The door was locked from the inside.

107
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,530
The walls are thick, like all audio rooms.

108
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,730
There are no spaces around the door

109
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,330
so you can operate it from the outside.

110
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,130
The power on the audio set was off

111
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,230
and the wound on the body was the same as Genichiro's.

112
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,730
Both of them were probably killed with that sword.

113
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,630
But why was that sword lying near the door?

114
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,630
The sheath was by the body.

115
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,630
Did Kazuki throw it there after stabbing himself?

116
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,230
No, that's impossible.

117
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,930
Why's there a scratch here with blood on it?

118
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,830
There's no blood on the tip.

119
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,330
That's it!

120
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,730
I've figured how this room was locked.

121
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,030
I knew it. There's no blood splatter on him.

122
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,830
Who could have done it?

123
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,430
What's this?

124
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,230
He's barefoot!

125
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,130
Wait a minute. The killer took the socks, too.

126
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,830
If the killer didn't mean to put them on Kazuki,

127
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,730
then why take them in the first place?

128
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,930
Did the killer use them for something else?

129
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,330
And if so, what was it?

130
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,830
I see. I've got it!

131
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,130
And if I'm right,

132
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,830
then it must be hidden somewhere.

133
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,630
Listen up, everyone. I've solved the mystery.

134
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,930
You mean about the footprints going in only one direction?

135
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,830
That's right.

136
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,130
The way I figure it, late last night,

137
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,630
Kazuki went to the annex wearing flat sandals or something

138
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,330
and for some reason, he killed his father.

139
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,630
After that, he put the suit of armor on

140
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,630
and headed for the main house,

141
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,430
very carefully retracing his footsteps.

142
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,330
Since he had the suit of armor on which added to his weight,

143
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,730
his previous footprints were completely erased

144
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,230
and the only footprints that remained

145
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,030
were those going from the annex to the main house.

146
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,330
I see.

147
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,330
He then returned to the audio room but felt guilt.

148
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,330
He locked himself in

149
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,530
and committed suicide by stabbing himself in the throat.

150
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,430
I... I don't believe it.

151
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,530
He would never do such a thing!

152
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,730
I knew it.

153
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,130
Now to find "the thing", I know it's hidden someplace.

154
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,630
What is this?

155
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,630
So that's what this was about.

156
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,130
Here it is!

157
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,830
I've found it. Just as I figured,

158
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,130
these murders were committed using the legend of Hidetomo's curse.

159
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,530
And the real killer is that person.

160
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,190
Mr. Mouri, I don't believe he'd commit suicide.

161
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,090
I'm sorry, madam,

162
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,690
but it's the truth.

163
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,890
Mr. Mouri?

164
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,490
Actually, I said that just to throw the killer off guard.

165
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,590
What?

166
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,190
What do you mean?

167
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,190
That's only half of my theory.

168
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,290
Like I just explained, Genichiro's killer

169
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,290
returned to the main house erasing the earlier footprints.

170
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,290
Anyone could have done this except for Kazuki

171
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,190
and the elder Mrs. Daimon who saw the warrior outside.

172
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,390
What do you mean, anyone?

173
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,290
What you're saying is,

174
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,190
Kazuki who committed suicide didn't kill father.

175
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,590
That's right.

176
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,190
Your brother did not kill your father.

177
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,390
And he didn't commit suicide either.

178
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,590
Judging from the wound on Genichiro,

179
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,490
I'd assume the killer was splattered with blood

180
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,790
but Kazuki's clothes...

181
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,590
His clothes under the suit of armor was spotless.

182
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,190
After the killing Genichiro,

183
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,190
the killer snuck into the audio room

184
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,390
and killed Kazuki.

185
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,990
But how?

186
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,690
Remember the sword on the floor of the audio room?

187
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,790
We looked upon it as the murder weapon, nothing else.

188
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,390
But that sword was not just the murder weapon,

189
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,090
it served another purpose, too.

190
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,790
It was used to lock the audio room.

191
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,990
What?

192
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,390
After killing Kazuki,

193
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,190
the killer put the suit of armor on him

194
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,590
and stuck the sword into the wall by the door.

195
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,990
Then took the hilt on the opposite end

196
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,490
and placed it on top of the door handle

197
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,090
so that it would touch the bolt.

198
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,190
The killer then exited the room cautiously

199
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,490
so the sword wouldn't fall then very, very slowly closed the door,

200
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,590
the hilt of the sword pushed against the bolt...

201
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,790
And there you have it, a locked room.

202
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,790
To open a door as sturdy as that,

203
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,790
you'd have to break it down.

204
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,590
The vibrations created when the door was being broken

205
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,290
would cause the sword to fall

206
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,590
and the set up would never be discovered.

207
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,590
I'm sure that's what the killer planned.

208
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,990
But why would anyone do such a thing?

209
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,390
Before I answer that, you all must think

210
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,790
as to why this happened on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death.

211
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,890
It has a special meaning.

212
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,190
The killer used the legend of Hidetomo's suit of armor

213
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,990
to it's full extent.

214
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,490
The killer created the illusion of

215
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,290
one set of footprints going in one direction,

216
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,790
so that we'd all believe

217
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,390
only the armor clad warrior was capable of committing the murder

218
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,990
and succeeded in making us think

219
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,590
Kazuki killed his father then committed suicide.

220
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,790
And to support the illusion,

221
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,690
the killer made Tatsuko, who believed strongly in the legend,

222
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,790
see the warrior walk.

223
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,190
At 12 midnight on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death,

224
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,890
she prays at the altar,

225
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,890
everyone in this family knows that.

226
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,390
Unfortunately, that's where the killer left us a clue.

227
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,490
Madam.

228
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,190
Last night, when you saw the armor clad warrior,

229
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,090
it wasn't carrying a sword, was it?

230
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,990
No, it wasn't.

231
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,990
Actually, he did indeed have it with him.

232
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,690
It's just that from Tatsuko's position,

233
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,190
she couldn't see it in his right hand.

234
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,090
Which means, the killer was probably left handed.

235
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,390
What?

236
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,690
It wasn't me!

237
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,890
Besides, how do you know the killer was left handed

238
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,190
if the sword was in the right?

239
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,890
In order to draw the sword with the left hand,

240
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,290
you need to hold the sheath in your right, don't you?

241
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,090
That's...

242
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,390
But Yoshiro is not the killer.

243
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,690
What?

244
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,090
There is another left handed person here.

245
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,390
Hatsuho Hojo! It's you!

246
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,090
Hatsuho.

247
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,190
You're left handed too, aren't you?

248
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,690
You used your left hand

249
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,090
when you served us coffee just now.

250
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,090
Yes, that's right.

251
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,090
But you need special skills to handle a sword, don't you?

252
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,490
And another thing, I had no motive

253
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,390
for killing Mr. Daimon or his son!

254
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,390
Ran. Can you go to Hatsuho's room

255
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,790
and get an old photo frame from the drawer in the chest?

256
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,090
Okay.

257
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,990
While we wait for Ran to get back, there's another thing.

258
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,590
Hatsuho, you said you looked out your window at the annex

259
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,590
and saw that Genichiro was dead. Isn't that right?

260
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,090
Yes.

261
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,490
Master Daimon is...

262
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,690
Master Daimon is dead in his room!

263
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,290
But think carefully.

264
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,190
How could you tell by looking from the main house to the annex

265
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,090
whether Genichiro was dead or just lying on the floor?

266
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,690
Well, when I saw him on the floor, I got so excited.

267
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,990
Ran, you're back.

268
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,790
Put the photo there where everyone can see.

269
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,090
Okay.

270
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,390
So tell me, Yoshiro.

271
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,690
Do you recognize the person in that photo?

272
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,490
It looks like Hatsuho and that's probably her father.

273
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,890
He's...

274
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,290
It's the man in the newspaper article. The one who committed suicide!

275
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,890
That's right.

276
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,490
She did have a motive for killing the two.

277
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,990
Hatsuho.

278
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,590
You watched Kazuki in the audio room

279
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,290
to make sure the tranquilizer in his coffee took effect,

280
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,690
then you headed for the annex through the back door.

281
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,090
Genichiro would surely open the door for her

282
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,090
without a second thought if she were to call out to him.

283
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,090
After killing him, you put the suit of armor on

284
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,490
and walked back to the main house over your own footprints.

285
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,690
You used a route where you wouldn't be seen

286
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,490
from Yoshiro, Kayoko or our rooms.

287
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,490
It could only be seen from Tatsuko and your room.

288
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,990
When you went to the annex,

289
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,090
you probably covered yourself with a white sheet or something

290
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:25,090
so that if someone saw you, you'd blend in with the snow.

291
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,190
After committing the murder, you hurriedly stuffed the sheet

292
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,390
into the bedroom closet in the annex.

293
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,190
I found it sticking out.

294
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,990
It's all... It's all just theoretical!

295
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,490
Yes, it was my father who committed suicide.

296
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,090
And yes, so I changed my name to hide my past

297
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,390
so no one would know.

298
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,790
But that doesn't prove I killed the two men!

299
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,390
I have proof.

300
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,990
It's inside the stove in the kitchen.

301
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,490
Conan found it.

302
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,590
Inside the stove, he found a bloody jacket

303
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,690
and the white socks Tatsuko left on the altar.

304
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,190
So you found them in the kitchen,

305
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,490
that doesn't prove I put them there!

306
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,890
Somebody might have put them there to frame me!

307
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,990
After the murders, it would have been possible for anyone

308
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,190
to hide them there!

309
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,790
Unfortunately, you were the only one with the opportunity.

310
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,890
The white socks Tatsuko left by the suit of armor

311
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,190
disappeared from the annex

312
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,190
but they weren't on the victim's body.

313
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,790
If the killer didn't mean to put them on Kazuki,

314
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,590
they why did the killer take them then hide them in the stove?

315
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,090
Hatsuho.

316
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,890
You've hurt your left foot, haven't you?

317
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,990
It appears you didn't bandage it well enough.

318
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,990
It seems to have started bleeding again a little while ago.

319
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,390
When you were serving the coffee just now,

320
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,690
I noticed some blood on your sock.

321
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,890
When you killed Genichiro in the annex,

322
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,990
you dropped and broke the cup.

323
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,290
You mistakenly stepped on the glass cutting your foot.

324
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,590
You knew that if you put the warrior's shoes on,

325
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,290
you'd get blood on them.

326
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,390
So you put the socks Tatsuko had left

327
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,390
and then put the shoes on over them.

328
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,690
Then you hid the socks in the kitchen stove

329
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,690
along with the jacket.

330
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,090
You realized that using the stove in the middle of the night

331
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,890
would cause suspicion.

332
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,290
So you decided to wait until morning then burn the evidence.

333
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,690
But when you went to prepare the coffee,

334
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,290
Ran went with you so you lost the opportunity.

335
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,790
Yes, you're right.

336
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,990
I killed both of them.

337
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,190
Why did you do it?

338
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,090
You were always so kind to me.

339
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,590
My father, who ran the factory, was an old-fashioned man.

340
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,990
He felt that helping others was more important than making money.

341
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,190
He took Daimon Industries orders

342
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,390
although it was too much to handle

343
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,890
just because they'd done business with them for so long.

344
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,190
But one day, just because of one little error,

345
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,390
Daimon Industries stopped using our factory.

346
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,690
My father's company went bankrupt.

347
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,090
Daimon Industries was having financial troubles

348
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,690
but saved themselves by sacrificing my father's company.

349
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,990
And as if to rub salt in my father's wounds,

350
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,590
Genichiro took the suit of armor from my father

351
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,690
as payment for debts due,

352
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,490
that suit of armor was a family heirloom.

353
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,890
It happened just when father decided to sell the suit of armor

354
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,190
in order to pay the employees their salaries.

355
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,390
He wasn't able to do anything for the employees

356
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,790
and on top of that, he couldn't use the family heirloom to help anyone.

357
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,390
Father killed himself because he blamed himself for everything.

358
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,790
I had been working in Tokyo,

359
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,190
but in order to avenge my father, I changed my name

360
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,590
and last year, I came here to work as their live in help.

361
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,090
I was determined to carry out my revenge

362
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,790
on the anniversary of father's death.

363
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,090
Hatsuho.

364
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,090
Do you think your father is happy

365
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,590
that you avenged his death?

366
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,590
Do you think he'd praise you?

367
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,790
Hatsuho.

368
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,090
It wasn't Hidetomo's spirit that put that suit of armor on.

369
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,290
Your heart wore the suit of armor,

370
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,090
the cold armor called revenge.

371
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,090
Ouch!

372
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,990
Conan, are you all right?

373
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,290
Ran, you okay?

374
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,090
The imprint I left got erased by yours.

375
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,090
It's just like that case with the suit of armor, don't you think?

376
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,490
Oh, no!

377
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,790
Conan. What are you trying to say?

378
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,790
I... I didn't mean anything by that.

379
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,390
Hey! Come back here, Conan!

380
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,790
I'm sorry!

381
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,090
Did she think I meant she was bigger and heavier?

382
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,220
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,940
"Cellphone"
