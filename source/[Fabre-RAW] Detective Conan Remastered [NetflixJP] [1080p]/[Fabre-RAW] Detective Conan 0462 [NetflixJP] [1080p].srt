1
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:02,988
Connected!

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:06,288
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:07,988
Eisuke Hondo is somewhat a suspicious character.

4
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:09,188
The mysterious case that occurred at the Teimusu River!

5
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:10,688
Something has begun to move!

6
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:12,088
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:13,488
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,488 --> 00:00:15,188
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,628 --> 00:02:00,928
"Haido Central Hospital"

10
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:06,828
Rena Mizunashi hasn't regained consciousness yet?

11
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,728
No.

12
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:12,628
Memory loss due to exterior injuries

13
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:16,728
usually improve in about a month.

14
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:18,228
But I was told by the doctor in charge,

15
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:20,628
that if this continues on for more than two months,

16
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,928
it may take even longer.

17
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,028
That's bad.

18
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,728
The longer this keeps on,

19
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:32,128
the higher the chance of them finding this place.

20
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:37,528
I think we should move her to a different hospital after all.

21
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,728
Maybe even to a hospital in the States if we have to.

22
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:41,528
No.

23
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,228
Doing so will only make things more conspicuous,

24
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,228
and we'd be doing exactly what they want us to do.

25
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:48,228
But...

26
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:53,228
Well, if that happens, we can take things from there.

27
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:55,828
And I don't think that there'd be a better bait to fish them with.

28
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:58,628
Bait?

29
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:00,328
By the way,

30
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:03,428
did you get anything on the personal history of Rena Mizunashi?

31
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:08,028
Actually, everything she said on and to Nichiuri TV was fabricated.

32
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:13,528
And there is no way of knowing where she was born or raised.

33
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:19,228
Which means we can't even tell if she has a family or not.

34
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:21,628
I'm pretty sure

35
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:25,528
that her crazy name, Rena Mizunashi, is also an alias anyway.

36
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:27,528
Crazy name?

37
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,528
Mizunashi is zero.

38
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:32,228
Rena equals zero and seven.

39
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:35,928
It's 007.

40
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,328
Get it?

41
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:50,328
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: The Little Witness"

42
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,628
But...

43
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:57,128
It may seem that way to you,

44
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:00,828
but it was only because your husband asked me to do it.

45
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:02,428
I'm home!

46
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:07,028
You should talk to your husband about it.

47
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,528
Is that right?

48
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,228
You ruthless rat!

49
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:19,128
Who was that on the phone?

50
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,928
A man asked me to investigate on his wife's affair, so I did.

51
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,328
And that was his wife on the line just now.

52
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:27,028
She said, "Thanks to you, I ended up getting a divorce.

53
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:29,728
Just what are you going to do about it?"

54
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,428
And she's the one that's having the affair.

55
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:33,828
Gosh.

56
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:36,328
I really wish I were James Bond or something.

57
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,528
Huh? Why?

58
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:43,328
What do you mean?

59
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:46,528
Because he gets to wear expensive brand name clothes.

60
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:50,028
He gets to ride super luxurious cars equipped with high tech devices

61
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:53,028
and conduct investigations in glamour.

62
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:10,428
On the other hand,

63
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:13,928
I work wearing the only suit I have and rent this car.

64
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:17,228
I was sneakily taking pictures of her having affairs, you know.

65
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,228
Moreover, no matter where he goes,

66
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:35,328
women are head over heels over him.

67
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:38,528
On the contrary, I get yelled at by a middle-aged woman.

68
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,328
I mean, how different can things get?

69
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:46,928
This coffee tastes good!

70
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,028
Is this some brand name coffee or something?

71
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,828
Nope.

72
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:52,628
It's drip type coffee that just came out the other day.

73
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,928
I just got it at the supermarket.

74
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,528
It said that if I collect enough points,

75
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,728
I would be able to get a cute coffee pot so I went out and bought it.

76
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:04,428
So, drip type coffee is what suits me best?

77
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,128
Oh, come on.

78
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,628
-If you want to complain, you don't have to drink it! -Hot!

79
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:16,328
That's hot...

80
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:20,028
You're...

81
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:22,128
Eisuke Hondo.

82
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,128
Hello.

83
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:25,828
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

84
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,228
Did you get burnt?

85
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,928
No, I'm fine!

86
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:32,928
I'm the one to blame for just standing there doing nothing.

87
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:36,128
And what brings you here?

88
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:40,128
I happened to run into him at the supermarket and brought him here.

89
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:43,828
Detective Mouri, you said I could come over whenever I wanted.

90
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,828
I guess I did.

91
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,428
Let me help you!

92
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:48,928
I'll take your calls or do whatever!

93
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:56,328
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

94
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:59,028
Hello? Hello?

95
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,428
Hey.

96
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,028
Huh? That's strange.

97
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,028
They hung up.

98
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,328
I mean, you went ahead and hung it up yourself!

99
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,328
Listen, don't touch anything!

100
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:21,628
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,228
I didn't even notice

102
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,028
-that he was in this room. -I'll go bring a towel.

103
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:30,628
Don't tell me that he deliberately erased his presence?

104
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:31,628
Or...

105
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,328
All right.

106
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,928
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there.

107
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:40,828
It's okay.

108
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,528
Or maybe he just have a very flimsy sense of presence.

109
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,428
Detectives sure don't have much to do, do they?

110
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:56,528
Yeah.

111
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:59,728
Might be different if somebody hadn't hung up on a client.

112
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:04,528
Huh? This comic is not going to be issued next week.

113
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:07,728
Too bad. I wanted to know how this story was going to continue.

114
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,728
It says that they're taking a rest because of an interview,

115
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:11,028
so I guess it can't be helped.

116
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:14,528
But this could require investigation as well, right?

117
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,128
Huh? Why?

118
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,228
Because although it's written that there will be an interview,

119
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,428
you never know, right?

120
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:26,028
It could be that the writer fled because he got sick of the job.

121
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:29,928
Or he could've come down with a cold that he's unable to write.

122
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,028
Or it could be

123
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:34,528
that the writer's been kidnapped and is being confined somewhere?

124
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:37,228
No, that couldn't be.

125
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:40,228
Remember the actor six months ago?

126
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,628
He said he was recharging himself and stayed away for some time.

127
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:45,628
He turned out to be actually sick.

128
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:49,428
There was someone recently, too.

129
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,828
Let's see...

130
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,528
You know, they were on TV a lot,

131
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,128
but is taking a rest and now they don't appear anymore.

132
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,628
I get it! Roku Itagaki!

133
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,128
Huh?

134
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,228
You know,

135
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:08,628
the musician that made a major debut last year and hit the scenes.

136
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,628
Isn't he the one you're talking about?

137
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:14,828
Yes, well...

138
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,028
Just as I thought.

139
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,628
Sonoko also mentioned about it.

140
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:20,228
It's been less than a year since he's debuted

141
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:21,928
and he's already taking time off to recharge himself,

142
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,528
so something is bound to have happened.

143
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:24,628
Like so.

144
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:27,328
Was Sonoko his fan or something?

145
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:30,228
Yeah. From the time he was in an indies band.

146
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,728
He probably got rich,

147
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:36,628
so he is fooling around with some ladies somewhere.

148
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,728
Just like 007.

149
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,628
That man was killed.

150
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:46,428
I saw him being thrown off a bridge!

151
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,028
I see.

152
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,628
So Takumi got excited

153
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:55,828
after hearing the CD of Roku Itagaki playing on a TV commercial?

154
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,728
Takumi has been telling you that, right?

155
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,228
Yes.

156
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:03,828
He said, "Daddy, this man with the saw died."

157
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,228
Saw?

158
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:09,728
His head looks like a saw.

159
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:14,728
I guess it's because of his silver haircut, so it does looked like it.

160
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:19,428
But there was no such news on TV or in the papers.

161
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,928
I didn't believe him at first,

162
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:25,728
but I heard that Mr. Itagaki suddenly took time off from work.

163
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,128
I got kind of worried

164
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:30,428
and decided to come talk it over with you, Detective Mouri.

165
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:33,428
I actually tried calling you before coming,

166
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,828
but for some reason, the phone was cut.

167
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:38,828
Oh, no.

168
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:41,828
Hey.

169
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:45,828
Takumi, do you know at which bridge you saw it?

170
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,428
I saw it the other day.

171
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,728
I don't know where, though.

172
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:53,328
I heard the sound of fireworks.

173
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:54,528
If it was the other day,

174
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,228
isn't it the fireworks that were shot up at the beginning of the New Year?

175
00:10:57,228 --> 00:11:02,828
Mr. Hashiratani, do you remember where Takumi was back then?

176
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:08,728
Yes. I think it was in my car on the way to visit a shrine.

177
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:12,328
We were in a traffic jam at the time.

178
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,828
I actually got pretty tired and was dozing off here and there.

179
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:17,528
So I don't remember which bridge we were crossing

180
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,028
when we heard the fireworks.

181
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,728
Can you tell us more in detail about what happened back then?

182
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,728
Let's see...

183
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:30,228
He had a big bag beside him and kept looking at the river.

184
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:32,428
But he suddenly got up, picked the bag up

185
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:35,028
and threw the bag down over the bridge.

186
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,028
Then, Mr. Itagaki was in that bag.

187
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,328
But how did you know Mr. Itagaki was in the bag?

188
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,228
I saw him before the bag was dropped.

189
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:45,228
It was sticking out of the bag.

190
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:47,028
There was a lot of blood.

191
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,028
The saw headed man's face.

192
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:00,532
I saw it!

193
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,432
That can't be.

194
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:09,332
If something like that were carried around,

195
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,732
somebody is bound to notice it.

196
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,132
But it was dark, so I had to take a good look.

197
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,432
It was hard to tell.

198
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:18,132
Then are you saying

199
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:20,932
that something you had to take a good look at to make out,

200
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:24,032
could only be seen by you?

201
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,232
But it happened so fast!

202
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:30,132
His head just popped out of the bag.

203
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:33,732
What did the man do after he threw the bag down?

204
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:37,432
He took out stuff from his clothes and dropped them.

205
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:40,032
I couldn't really see because his body was in the way.

206
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:43,132
Then he started looking for something,

207
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,232
touching his clothes here and there.

208
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,832
Touching his clothes here and there?

209
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,032
Before he started looking for something,

210
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:50,432
did he put something in his mouth?

211
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:53,732
Yes, he did.

212
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,432
I see. It was a cigarette.

213
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:58,132
He had a cigarette in his mouth.

214
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,632
Then he must've been looking for a lighter.

215
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:04,032
And did he found the lighter?

216
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:07,532
Yes. After he lit the cigarette, he threw that away, too.

217
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:10,032
Did he stay there for a while then?

218
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:11,232
Nope.

219
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:14,732
He got in a car that was nearby and left right away.

220
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,932
Do you remember what he looked like, or what kind of car it was?

221
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:20,732
The car was a dark colour.

222
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,832
But as for his face, since he was wearing a cap...

223
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,632
But he had a drawing on his arm.

224
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:30,332
What? You saw a drawing?

225
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:33,932
A drawing of a strange nail.

226
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,832
A drawing of a strange nail?

227
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,232
That's right!

228
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:43,332
Near the car that I was riding back then,

229
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:47,532
I saw a shiny hammer that was this big!

230
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:50,332
A shiny hammer?

231
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:51,832
Yes.

232
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,932
A saw,

233
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:57,332
a nail and a hammer?

234
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,732
Is this brat playing games with us?

235
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:03,832
Mr. Mouri?

236
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:05,532
Well...

237
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:08,932
A boy like you shouldn't tease adults, okay?

238
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:22,532
Takumi. Was that your name?

239
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:23,532
Yes.

240
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:29,832
You're lying, aren't you?

241
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,232
No, I'm not.

242
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,632
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:57,332
My chance.

244
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,932
Excuse...

245
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,032
If I remove the transmitter and listening device now...

246
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,032
All right, I've got it!

247
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:12,632
Sonny.

248
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:54,532
Don't tell me you followed me here?

249
00:15:58,432 --> 00:15:59,532
Of course not.

250
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,732
It's just a coincidence.

251
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:07,932
I see.

252
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,832
Thank you.

253
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,532
Thanks for picking up my shoe.

254
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,532
Really, thank you so much.

255
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:49,832
Takumi.

256
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,532
I guess he's not lying.

257
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:56,132
Huh?

258
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,032
He's got to be.

259
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:01,032
Four days have already gone by since he saw it happen, you know.

260
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:04,732
If it's true, the body should've been found by now,

261
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,332
and there would be news about it.

262
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:10,732
We interrupt this program to report special news that just came in.

263
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:14,932
Today at dawn, the body of a man that was found in Teimusu River

264
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:17,532
was confirmed by the bereaved family to be

265
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,732
"Roku Itagaki (22)" -Mr. Roku Itagaki himself.

266
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:27,332
The body was found shoved into a bag

267
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:28,432
and on his head,

268
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:32,232
there were several traces of assault including those that were fatal.

269
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:35,032
Therefore, the police are investigating the case

270
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,732
as murder through a grudge.

271
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,032
It was for real.

272
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:42,232
This means that

273
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:45,232
my son saying that he saw someone throw the bag

274
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:49,232
with Mr. Itagaki's body inside it over the bridge...

275
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:51,332
It really happened, didn't it?

276
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:53,332
Of course! I'm not lying!

277
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:57,432
Then shouldn't we report this to the police right away?

278
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,032
That's right.

279
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:02,032
This boy is an important witness.

280
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:07,232
But he says that Roku Itagaki's got a saw head

281
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:10,832
and that the killer had a drawing of a nail on his arm.

282
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:14,532
He goes on to say,

283
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,532
when he saw all that near the car he was riding,

284
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:20,832
he saw a big shiny hammer.

285
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:25,132
I don't think the police will believe what this boy is saying at all.

286
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:30,232
Moreover, he doesn't even know where the bridge the body was dropped from.

287
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:33,232
Then why don't we take Takumi in the car

288
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:35,132
and replay that entire day?

289
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:37,032
We may just come up with something.

290
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,832
Besides, we already know that it's the Teimusu River.

291
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,332
That's right.

292
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:45,832
He witnessed it on a bridge on the way to the shrine on New Year's day.

293
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:50,332
Mr. Hashiratani, do you at least remember what road you took that day?

294
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,232
Yes, sort of.

295
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,032
But you're fantastic, Eisuke!

296
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:57,932
I mean, you could tell whether he was telling the truth or not

297
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,032
just by looking at his face.

298
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:03,132
Well, it's really no big deal.

299
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:07,632
I just copied what my dad used to do when I was a child.

300
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,832
It's similar to a magic trick.

301
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:17,432
And?

302
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:20,832
Which way did you turn at this intersection?

303
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:23,132
If we make a right, it's Haido Big Bridge.

304
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:26,232
If we go straight, we come out to Haido Central Bridge.

305
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,432
If we make a left, we come out to New Haido Bridge.

306
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:30,632
Yes.

307
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:34,932
I'm sure it was the nearest street in the middle.

308
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:38,332
Then it's Haido Central Bridge?

309
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:39,332
But...

310
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:47,632
I took a right there to avoid traffic.

311
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:49,732
They usually have checkpoints for drunk driving at the end of the year.

312
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,632
Then, it's Haido Big Bridge?

313
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,132
Oh, no.

314
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:57,232
There are a lot of traffic lights to the right, so I went left.

315
00:19:57,232 --> 00:20:00,332
But it's the farthest road to take.

316
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:04,132
Come on, let's be a bit more specific.

317
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:06,332
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:09,932
I always take this road to work.

319
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:13,832
I took whichever road I felt like taking at the time.

320
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:17,532
So I don't really remember which road I took that day.

321
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,232
I mean...

322
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,132
Hey,

323
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,932
you said you remembered the way!

324
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,032
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:28,732
Dad!

326
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:30,432
It's all right.

327
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,632
Why don't we stop over at all three bridges in order?

328
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,732
That's right.

329
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,932
In order to cross the Teimusu River from here,

330
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:40,832
we're going to have to cross one of the three bridges anyway.

331
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,032
That's it.

332
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,232
Right, Conan?

333
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:47,532
Conan?

334
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,132
Yeah.

335
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,632
What's the matter? You're not your usual peppy self.

336
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,432
I'm just fine.

337
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,032
I'm fine.

338
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:02,132
Really? Okay then.

339
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:14,732
I just copied what my dad used to do when I was a child.

340
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,732
It's similar to a magic trick.

341
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:20,432
No.

342
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:22,132
It's no magic trick.

343
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,332
What he did a while ago,

344
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:29,732
is what that person did back then.

345
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:33,232
It is a way to detect lies by checking for irregularities in the pulse

346
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:37,532
and breathing as well as for dilation of the pupils.

347
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:42,132
Moreover, his actions are just like that person.

348
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:44,032
They're almost identical.

349
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:47,332
Just as I thought.

350
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:48,432
This guy...

351
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:51,432
He's connected to...

352
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:03,932
Eisuke Hondo.

353
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:07,632
You're...

354
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,532
And that person...

355
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:19,132
You're connected with that person.

356
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,632
Rena Mizunashi.

357
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:26,332
The woman called Kir

358
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,632
of the Black Organization!

359
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,032
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:51,632
