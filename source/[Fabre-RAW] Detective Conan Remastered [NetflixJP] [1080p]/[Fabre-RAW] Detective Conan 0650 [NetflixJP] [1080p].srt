1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,983
At the Mouri Detective Agency,

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:07,229
a man who showed up after following three ladies,

3
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,329
intimidated everyone with his gun and bombs,

4
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,991
and besieged the entire place.

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,329
The man's name was Isao Sawaguri.

6
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,829
He's the elder brother of Miku Sawaguri,

7
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:20,529
a mystery writer who killed herself at a hot spring inn a month ago.

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,929
Sawaguri who refused to believe that his sister committed suicide,

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:27,029
ordered the great detective Sleeping Kogoro

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,029
to shed some light on the truth.

11
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,629
The three ladies he brought here

12
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:35,529
were all amateur mystery writers and friends with Miku.

13
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:39,029
Sawaguri suspected that one of them murdered his sister

14
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,129
and made it appear to be a suicide.

15
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:43,529
Soon after Sawaguri found out

16
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:47,029
that Ran's cell phone connection was still alive,

17
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:49,329
I having no choice, introduced myself as Shinichi Kudo,

18
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,029
and formally accepted his demand to solve the case.

19
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,629
From the materials and testimonies

20
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:58,329
pertaining to the case sent my way,

21
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,529
I uncovered the truth behind it,

22
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,929
but I couldn't reveal it right away.

23
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,429
For Sawaguri had already announced

24
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:06,529
that he would commit murder-suicide with the culprit

25
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,829
once he found out their identity.

26
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,429
I had to somehow solve the case without risking any fatalities.

27
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:16,055
However, the police had been steadily waiting

28
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,629
in preparation to snipe down the gunman.

29
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:21,829
Thanks to Ran's quick thinking,

30
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:24,329
we were able to halt the sniping,

31
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,029
but we couldn't waste any more time.

32
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:30,629
Because if the mystery was still unsolved by the next morning,

33
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,629
Sawaguri planned to blow up the agency,

34
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,129
taking everyone with him.

35
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,929
Thus, I look extreme measures.

36
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,079
It's all right.

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,081
Please calm down.

38
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,129
Because I know the identity of the Rat.

39
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,429
Really?

40
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,829
The Rat that was the last to show up to Miku's room...

41
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,629
Ms. Mitsui,

42
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,429
it can be none other than you.

43
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:15,729
If all cases were men,

44
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,429
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,229
As the path to the truth twists and twists,

46
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:21,529
Shinichi passes down his final judgment.

47
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,929
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,829
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,029
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

50
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:56,867
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Release)"

51
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:18,967
Just as expected from the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

52
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,267
Well done.

53
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,667
The dirty Rat, who freaking killed my sister Miku

54
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:27,867
and made it look like a suicide, Tamami Mitsui...

55
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,267
He's made it clear that you were the one.

56
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,867
No, no...

57
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,667
I would never kill Miku.

58
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,167
Don't play dumb with me.

59
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:41,467
The famous high school detective is saying you're the culprit.

60
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:44,567
But... but it really wasn't me...

61
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,767
Any excuses you have I'll hear you out on the other side.

62
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:54,067
My sister's waiting in the other world.

63
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,667
Well, don't forget, you two karate kittens.

64
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:02,281
About the fact that I've got bombs strapped to my body.

65
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,867
And that as long as I can kill this witch,

66
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,287
I won't mind dying.

67
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,667
Darn.

68
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,567
Shinichi Kudo.

69
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,067
What the heck are you going to do?

70
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,467
Shinichi.

71
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,267
Please wait.

72
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:20,299
Shinichi.

73
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:28,307
I did say that the person whom Miku nicknamed "Rat" was Mitsui,

74
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,767
but I haven't said one word

75
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,567
about Mitsui having killed your sister, you know?

76
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,267
What?

77
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,467
But didn't you just say it?

78
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:41,467
That the "Rat" who went to my sister's room last was this woman.

79
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,321
Yes.

80
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,867
Then, why?

81
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:47,067
If I recall, your conjecture was as follows, right?

82
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:50,767
The culprit drugged your sister to sleep, slit her wrist,

83
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,331
positioned her over the bathtub in the bathroom

84
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,333
and staged a suicide.

85
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,335
After confirming her death,

86
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,867
the culprit sent you an email saying "goodbye"

87
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,967
using his sister's cell phone.

88
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,343
Thinking the email odd,

89
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,345
you knocked on your sister's door

90
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,067
but there was no answer.

91
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,067
You had no choice

92
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,351
but to climb over the balcony from your room next door,

93
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,367
and break into your sister's room from the window.

94
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:19,167
That was when you found her body in the bathroom.

95
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:23,167
In short, the culprit had predicted in advance that you would do so,

96
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,867
hid inside the room,

97
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:28,167
and while you were distracted by your sister's body,

98
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,267
fled through the window you broke according to you.

99
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,367
Yes, that's exactly right.

100
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,967
Then,

101
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,379
where did the culprit pass through to make an escape after that?

102
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,381
Of course, the culprit went into my room next door,

103
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,867
and just went out the door?

104
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,467
I was in my sister's room after all.

105
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,767
When I first went to knock on my sister's door,

106
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,391
I ended up raising hell.

107
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,467
A lot of bystanders were already there at that point,

108
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:58,667
it would've been easy to mix in with that crowd.

109
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:02,401
But didn't you say you heard about it as well?

110
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,403
That a guest three doors down

111
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,867
witnessed Mitsui coming out from your sister's room

112
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,409
in a big hurry with a book in hand.

113
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:15,267
In other words, the room that Mitsui came out of wasn't yours,

114
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,367
but your sister's.

115
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,419
That doesn't seem to fit in with your theory, though.

116
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,767
He must have mistaken it.

117
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,767
Since that guest's room was three doors away from my sister's, right?

118
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,867
He must have confused her coming out of my room

119
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,567
instead of my sister's room next door.

120
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,867
No, that wouldn't be the case.

121
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,435
That witness's room was on the same side

122
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:40,439
as your sister's and three doors away.

123
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,267
Plus, he said he was about to leave his room,

124
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,467
but as soon as he saw Ms. Mitsui running across in a big rush,

125
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,167
he immediately shut the door.

126
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,449
If he saw her from that position,

127
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:51,367
the angle would've been too narrow,

128
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,367
and he only saw her for a split second.

129
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,767
He wouldn't have been able to distinguish at all

130
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,967
which room she had come from.

131
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:01,367
In that case, how come that guest knew for sure

132
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,567
she came from my sister's room?

133
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,967
That's because...

134
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,367
the door to your sister's room Ms. Mitsui came out

135
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,967
of had been wide open,

136
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:13,067
and he had seen the room number affixed to the door.

137
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,767
Ms. Mitsui was in such a rush

138
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,867
because she wanted to use the restroom at once.

139
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,867
The fact that the open door was closed later on

140
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:27,467
proves that your sister was still alive.

141
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:30,267
The doors at that inn are not auto-lock doors,

142
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,491
if your sister hadn't locked the door from inside,

143
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,493
you wouldn't have gone through all the trouble

144
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:38,867
to break the window in order to enter.

145
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,767
Then who was it?

146
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,967
Who was the culprit that killed my sister?

147
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,567
According to my sister's postings, someone should've been there, right?

148
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,967
The murderer, who was still in my sister's room until she got drowsy.

149
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,967
About your sister's debut work...

150
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,513
have you happened to read it?

151
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:59,167
No. I'm not much of a reader.

152
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,467
I haven't read that yet.

153
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,521
The title is...

154
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,525
"The Death's Funeral Procession".

155
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,527
The main character was a police detective

156
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,767
who was desperately pursuing

157
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,067
the shadow of a serial killing fiend.

158
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,535
One day, the detective was visited by Death at his side,

159
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:21,167
who told him, "You won't ever be able to catch him in your lifetime".

160
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,867
It was only natural...

161
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,267
Since that detective had been the serial killer

162
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,367
who unconsciously wandered the streets night after night

163
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,067
and committed the crimes.

164
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,567
The detective, upon realizing this fact,

165
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,567
became tormented by his conscience.

166
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:40,559
And took his own life following Death's lead.

167
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,867
Hey, you're not saying...

168
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:46,267
Right. Your sister laid her hands

169
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,667
upon her "Death's Funeral Procession"

170
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,067
for the first time in ages in order to autograph it.

171
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,367
Is she uncontrollably put herself

172
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,367
in the place of the main character she created,

173
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:58,967
and saw a hallucinated image of Death in her room.

174
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:04,967
You can imagine what your sister might have done afterwards, right?

175
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,267
Don't tell me...

176
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,667
My sister kill... killed herself?

177
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,467
No, no way. It can't be.

178
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:21,067
That's going to be... a lie.

179
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,611
Breach.

180
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,613
Charge in!

181
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,567
Charge!

182
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,617
No.

183
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,267
Secured.

184
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,367
All's well that ends well.

185
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,639
Good for you.

186
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,567
Well... that still remains to be seen?

187
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,167
What do you mean?

188
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,067
All right, we will be contacting you for details,

189
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,867
regarding the case of yourselves, if you please.

190
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,067
Yes.

191
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,667
Understood.

192
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,967
I'll be on my way.

193
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,967
Good work, everyone.

194
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,675
I'm worn out.

195
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:40,267
Still, you really had me going there, Kudo.

196
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,967
I almost thought you were really going to name the culprit

197
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:46,685
and have that bomber man kill her.

198
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,689
Well, I can understand if you figured out that it was a suicide,

199
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,967
but since I've never read Miku Sawagiri's debut work,

200
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:55,467
I wouldn't have been able to solve it.

201
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:59,267
Sorry, but I haven't read "Death's Funeral Procession" either.

202
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,267
What?

203
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:05,567
That was just a bluff I used for the situation at hand.

204
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,267
In order for that bomber man to truly believe

205
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:11,267
his sister had committed suicide.

206
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:15,867
Otherwise, for someone who had been leisurely posting on SNS

207
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:18,717
to suddenly see a hallucination of Death and commit suicide...

208
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,719
is an illogical deduction

209
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,721
I'd never give even with my mouth pried open.

210
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,367
Hey, you don't mean to say...

211
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:28,467
Right, now on to our main topic.

212
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,067
It really exists,

213
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,967
Death who killed Miku Sawaguri

214
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,067
and made it seem like a suicide

215
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,367
is among those three people over there.

216
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,481
It really exists,

217
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,747
Death who killed Miku Sawagiri

218
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,281
and made it seem like a suicide

219
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,481
is among those three people over there.

220
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:57,081
Don't tell me...

221
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,681
were we wrong about the nicknames Miku assigned

222
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,481
to those three people?

223
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,763
No, they were indeed as I said.

224
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,181
Mitsui, whose family stonemasonry business deals

225
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:10,181
with rat-colored stones, was Rat.

226
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,771
Yuchi, who works at the bakery

227
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,581
and sells bread that is golden brown, was Fox.

228
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:17,281
Nihei, the wife of a seal craftsman

229
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:20,381
who carves ivory-colored seals, was Elephant.

230
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,781
Those were all true.

231
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,681
Then, was the order in which the three people

232
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,081
went to Miku's room wrong?

233
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:34,481
No, the order was indeed Nihei, Yuchi and Mitsui.

234
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,081
Given that Miku's postings on SNS

235
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,799
said the order was Elephant, then Fox, and finally Rat.

236
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,281
In that case, since the last one to visit was Mitsui...

237
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,481
Was Mitsui the culprit after all?

238
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,381
No, you're wrong.

239
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,281
I see. She left the room

240
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,081
but returned afterwards and committed the crime.

241
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,815
No, that wouldn't be the case.

242
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:03,581
Mitsui was seen coming out of Miku's room in a big hurry.

243
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,381
Despite having been seen exhibiting such odd behavior,

244
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:09,481
the possibility of her returning there again to commit murder

245
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,581
is highly unlikely.

246
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:15,481
Especially, so if she were a premeditated murderer

247
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,381
who crafted a sealed room and set it up to look like a suicide.

248
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:21,481
Then, who the heck was the culprit?

249
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:25,481
Ran. Sorry, but could you read those for us again?

250
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,847
The posts from Miku right before she was murdered.

251
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:29,681
Yes.

252
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,853
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

253
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,681
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

254
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:39,581
that pesky Elephant.

255
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,581
Next to come was Fox.

256
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,863
Trying to stir up an argument again, freaking annoying.

257
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:48,081
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

258
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,581
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

259
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:52,381
I'll make short work of the autograph

260
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:54,481
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

261
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:57,281
Darn, she's still here.

262
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,281
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

263
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:01,781
What should I do?

264
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:06,681
Then Ms. Mitsui, I'll ask you.

265
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,181
When you went to Miku's room,

266
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,681
she didn't let you use her restroom, did she?

267
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,081
That... that's right.

268
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,981
Like I said...

269
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,881
She was only being a little mean to Ms. Mitsui with an upset stomach.

270
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:23,781
Well, was it really like what you said?

271
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:24,903
What?

272
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,281
Could it be?

273
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:33,181
Right, the one who was still lingering in her room wasn't Rat,

274
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,381
but Fox, the second to come.

275
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,915
Shinobu Yuchi.

276
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:40,281
It was actually you.

277
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,481
Yuchi is...

278
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,681
The culprit?

279
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:52,931
How... how come?

280
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:56,381
See, Miku posted about it, right?

281
00:15:56,381 --> 00:16:00,939
The Fox came to pick a fight and just wouldn't leave.

282
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:06,381
Unfortunately, Mitsui came by in the middle of the argument.

283
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,947
So she hid Yuchi in the restroom for the time being

284
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,381
and intended to make Mitsui go away quickly.

285
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:14,381
Of course she had Yuchi take the slippers with her.

286
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:15,581
Since it'd be obvious

287
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:18,381
that someone else was still inside if there were two pairs.

288
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,581
But at that time,

289
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,781
instead of Yuchi's own damp slippers she had worn from the baths,

290
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,081
she accidentally took Miku's slippers instead.

291
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:29,981
And then Mitsui mistakenly wore Yuchi's slippers,

292
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:32,581
which felt uncomfortable wearing.

293
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,581
Was that the case, Kudo?

294
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:39,881
Yes. What happened afterwards was just as the bomber man Isao said.

295
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,881
After killing Miku in the bathroom

296
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,681
while disguising it as a suicide.

297
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:44,781
She text mailed Isao

298
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:48,181
and induced him to break the window glass and enter the room.

299
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,581
From that broken window,

300
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:52,281
she crossed over the adjoining balcony to Isao's room.

301
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:55,381
And then snuck out from that room via the door

302
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,581
and mixed in with the bystanders who were gathered.

303
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:03,001
But... couldn't we also assume that Nihei, who came by first,

304
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,005
might have been hiding in the restroom the entire time?

305
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
Miku posted about Fox who was still there

306
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,009
and called her "annoying".

307
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,781
If Fox had left,

308
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,681
she would've happily posted it without a doubt,

309
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,281
but we saw nothing like that.

310
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,781
Also, Nihei has a methodical personality and is high strung

311
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:23,781
to the extent that she would line up people's slippers.

312
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,023
It'd be hard to imagine

313
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,181
that she would mistake someone else's slippers for her own.

314
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,881
But, isn't that merely circumstantial evidence?

315
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,381
I do have concrete proof.

316
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,481
As Miku was struggling to escape from the bathroom,

317
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:42,481
She grabbed the bathmat with her bloody hands, there's the photo.

318
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:45,681
Although the two marks near the door clearly indicated handprints,

319
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:49,981
the blood marks farther were those from her fingertips.

320
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,481
That's proof she was grasping something.

321
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,281
And now I'd like to direct your attention

322
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,481
to Yuchi's signed book from Miku.

323
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,581
Depending on the printing method,

324
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,581
the side of a book-also known as the fore edge

325
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:06,581
would either line up neatly or appear jagged.

326
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:08,381
But the method would never change

327
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:10,481
between copies of the same first printing.

328
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,071
However, for the same reason, only Yuchi's signed book

329
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,981
had its fore edge neatly lined up.

330
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:20,181
It's likely because Yuchi's filed the edge down with sandpaper.

331
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:25,083
To conceal Miku's bloody handprints she left by grabbing onto the book

332
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,381
in her last moments.

333
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,781
That's the unshakable proof.

334
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,081
She bought another copy

335
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:34,181
and replaced the cover with the new one

336
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:37,095
to make it look like nothing was on it.

337
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:39,097
But the book warped when it was grasped,

338
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:44,381
so she couldn't hide the blood marks that adhered deeper into the pages.

339
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:48,681
But why would the signed book be on the bathmat?

340
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,381
While I was carrying her to the bathroom,

341
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,881
after drugging her to sleep,

342
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,881
it fell out from my bathrobe.

343
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,681
Afterwards she bloodied the book,

344
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,781
but I didn't care much.

345
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,481
Since I was going to toss away the book anyway.

346
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,681
But, I couldn't bring myself to do so.

347
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,081
Because inside that book

348
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:19,137
was the most popular story out of all the ones I had written.

349
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,681
"I had written".

350
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,481
Don't tell me...

351
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,981
-Miku stole your work? -What?

352
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:31,149
Well, since we wrote it together,

353
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,781
I suppose it'd be a joint work.

354
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,381
She asked me for a favor.

355
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:39,581
"I got invited to publish a book,

356
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:42,781
so do you mind helping me out?" she said.

357
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,681
Then, that debut work turned out to be a hit,

358
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:49,581
and before we knew it, she had become a Naomoto awardee.

359
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:52,381
And I wasn't jealous at that time.

360
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,681
Since I only helped her with that one,

361
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,175
and she had earned the award through her own hard work.

362
00:19:57,381 --> 00:20:00,481
I was even proud to be her friend.

363
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,281
And I thought it was my turn to shine,

364
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:07,185
until I was told this by the publisher I brought my own work to...

365
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,381
This is indeed interesting, but 

366
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:18,181
It's just too much like Miku Sawaguri's literary style.

367
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:20,581
One Miku Sawaguri is enough.

368
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:24,281
How about if you try becoming her ghost writer?

369
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:27,205
I didn't realize it until then.

370
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:29,207
That she had imitated my writing style

371
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:34,081
and taken it as her own since her debut.

372
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,081
So of course I told her,

373
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:37,881
"At the very least, please announce to the public

374
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:40,981
that your debut work was a joint work with me."

375
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,981
But she retorted,

376
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:47,225
"Are you trying to smear a Naomoto Award winning author?"

377
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,481
and denied my request.

378
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,231
If things went on like that, I'd become a non existent ghost.

379
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:54,881
That's why...

380
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:58,481
I decided to make her the ghost instead.

381
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:00,781
But in the end,

382
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:04,481
I really should have thrown that book away.

383
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:09,247
Even if I wanted to read "Death's Funeral Procession",

384
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,781
now It'd just bring back memories of our late nights

385
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:14,981
conjuring up ideas and racing to put them to paper,

386
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,581
and I could never read it like this.

387
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:23,261
A book I'm unable to turn a page.

388
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,681
There'd be no point of me keeping it.

389
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:02,081
Shinichi just left without even saying anything?

390
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,881
Despite having the nerve to butt in

391
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,781
and give a deduction right in front of you?

392
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:08,581
Yes.

393
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:10,581
I picked up the phone again

394
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:13,681
after the police came to take the culprit Yuchi away,

395
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,373
but he'd already hung up.

396
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,181
Wearing a skirt?

397
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:23,981
But, after that, I got an email from Shinichi.

398
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:25,781
He said "Thanks".

399
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:30,381
At that time, Shinichi had gone back to his house for some files,

400
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:33,681
and just so happened to stop by at Dr. Agasa's house..

401
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:37,395
He could've at least shown his face to his sweetheart, I say.

402
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:41,081
Perhaps there was a reason he couldn't show his face.

403
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:46,281
Well, thanks to what just happened, I really got it.

404
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:50,081
That Conan and Kudo are on super good terms with each other.

405
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:53,181
And that you're really tougher than I thought.

406
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:57,081
Is this about karate?

407
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,030
"Kansai Dialect".

409
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,968
-Dad, here's a case. -What happened?

410
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,427
Surprise, it's a one-hour special next week.

411
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,720
You don't say!
