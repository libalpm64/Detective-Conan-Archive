1
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:04,571
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,271
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,171
A murder is committed using the illusion that is the talk of the town!

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:10,771
A mystery on stage. A double trick mystery!

5
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,171
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:13,771
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,671
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,743
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

9
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,443
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

10
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:03,343
The sign looks like a haunted house

11
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:06,143
which you really like!

12
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,843
What? No way, Conan!

13
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:14,343
Well, Genyo Fuyuki's magic show is unlike Sanada Kazumi's cheerful one.

14
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,843
It is known for having a dark feel to it.

15
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:20,243
Why would Mr. Fuyuki want to see you immediately, Dad?

16
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,843
Anyway, let's go and see.

17
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:24,743
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

18
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:34,743
"Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

19
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:37,443
"Genyo Fuyuki"

20
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:38,743
Yes. Please come in.

21
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,143
Excuse me.

22
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,643
Hello, Mr. Mouri.

23
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,543
Please forgive me for having a renown detective like you

24
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,543
"Genyo Fuyuki (35)" -come all the way here.

25
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,443
I'm Fuyuki.

26
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:51,143
I'm Mouri.

27
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:52,743
She's my daughter.

28
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,443
Hello. I'm Ran Mouri.

29
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,743
And this is the freeloader Conan.

30
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,743
Freeloader?

31
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,443
Talk about rude.

32
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:02,843
Hello.

33
00:03:02,843 --> 00:03:04,343
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:08,043
When I told them that you called, they insisted on coming along

35
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:09,443
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

36
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:10,943
That's perfectly okay.

37
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,943
Do you both like magic?

38
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,043
Yes, I love it!

39
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:18,943
We often go to see magic shows, too.

40
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,343
But those were only little demonstrations.

41
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,043
Okay then.

42
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:45,043
You can see the trick by changing the base angle.

43
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,543
Fantastic!

44
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,443
Well, I guess he's got technique.

45
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,743
By the way,

46
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:09,643
I asked you to come here, Mr. Mouri,

47
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:14,443
because there is someone in this troupe that is after my life.

48
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:20,443
I would like you to figure out who it is, Mr. Mouri.

49
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:23,443
Were you blackmailed or something?

50
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,543
Recently, twice when I was rehearsing,

51
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:29,643
equipment came falling from above and I barely made it.

52
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,943
If it only happened once, I would've thought it was just a coincidence.

53
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:34,943
But when it happened consecutively...

54
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,143
Was anybody near you at that time?

55
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,243
No. I was alone.

56
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:42,043
How many troupe members are there other than you, Mr. Fuyuki?

57
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:44,843
Hey, just what are you doing asking questions?

58
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:48,943
I'm sorry. And how many are there?

59
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,743
There are five of us besides me.

60
00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:00,843
First, my assistant Misa Uehara.

61
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,943
"Misa Uehara (26)" -She's my ex-girlfriend

62
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:06,443
that I one-sidedly broke my marriage engagement with three years ago.

63
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,443
She still has a grudge against what I did.

64
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,443
One-sidedly?

65
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,643
Yes.

66
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:15,443
And likewise, another assistant Chiaki Nakagawa.

67
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:19,243
"Chiaki Nakagawa (24)" -She is my ex-wife that I divorced by consent.

68
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:23,643
However, she hates me to this day for my repeated extra-marital affairs.

69
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:27,643
And next is Kazuma Ishida, who is in charge of filming videos.

70
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,543
"Kazuma Ishida (19)" -He's my disciple

71
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:33,343
and I'm making him take videos deliberately so that he can study magic.

72
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:34,743
In charge of taking videos?

73
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:36,743
He has the talent for becoming a magician

74
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:38,543
on top of being an obedient nice boy.

75
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,743
He's the only one I trust.

76
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:43,543
Beside him is the stage director, Mr. Shingo Shoji.

77
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,343
"Shingo Shoji (37)" -He used to once be my disciple,

78
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:50,943
but he lacked talent as a magician, so I hired him as our stage director.

79
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:55,343
He does not agree with me with my stage performance,

80
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,943
so I'm thinking of having him quit after the performance today.

81
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,643
You mean you're firing him?

82
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,143
That's right.

83
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:04,143
The last one is the crane operator, Minoru Hasegawa.

84
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:07,443
"Minoru Hasegawa (45)" -He loves to gamble and he owes me a lot of money.

85
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:10,343
So if I die, all his debts will be gone.

86
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:15,043
In other words, those who have the motive to come after my life...

87
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,843
Are four people leaving aside Mr. Kazuma Ishida.

88
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,443
Yes, that's right.

89
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,643
Mr. Mouri.

90
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:24,843
Yes?

91
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,343
Here.

92
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,343
These are tickets for tonight's show.

93
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:29,943
Oh, I see.

94
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:33,643
I don't think anything will happen during the performance,

95
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,743
but I will be doing life endangering magic, too.

96
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:39,743
Let's decide what the signal will be in case of emergency.

97
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,143
Signal?

98
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:44,043
When I show you this signal,

99
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:48,843
please come up on stage even if I'm still performing and save me.

100
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:52,843
But why don't you just cancel the performance?

101
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:54,643
I can't do that.

102
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:58,343
I have pride as a professional magician.

103
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:01,143
Okay.

104
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:04,943
I'll do the best I can as a professional detective, too.

105
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:06,343
Please do that

106
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,043
and please make sure that none of the members find out about this.

107
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,443
I understand.

108
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:15,743
There's still some time before the show starts.

109
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:17,443
Why don't you guys go somewhere till...

110
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:19,643
What's the matter, Ran?

111
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:25,843
Ran, I bet that you're disappointed about Mr. Fuyuki, right?

112
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,943
Well, him saying things like he broke his marriage engagement one-sidedly,

113
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:34,443
or he got divorced because of his repeated extra-marital affairs.

114
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:37,543
He says it like it means nothing.

115
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:40,843
Well, a lot of things happen in the adult world.

116
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:43,243
Just like you and Mrs. Kisaki.

117
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:45,543
Conan!

118
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:49,143
-That hurts... -You keep your mouth shut!

119
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:51,043
I've got to work.

120
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:54,143
So you guys can go somewhere and kill the time! Understand?

121
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,843
Conan, are you all right?

122
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,043
Huh?

123
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:04,743
If something were to happen during the show,

124
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,443
it would be when the magic trick is performed.

125
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,043
What are you doing here?

126
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,643
So this is how it is.

127
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:13,943
Hey, you!

128
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,743
Hey, stop ignoring me!

129
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:17,743
-Somebody is coming. -What?

130
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,043
This is not good. Let's hide, Conan.

131
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,843
-This side! -Okay!

132
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,943
Lie down on this. I'll put the lid on for you.

133
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,243
Okay, will do!

134
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,443
Hey, Conan.

135
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,643
Don't tell me that this is the beauty slicing box?

136
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,543
Don't worry.

137
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,943
Your body parts will be connected again.

138
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,843
No! That's not the point.

139
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:40,643
-Put your feet inside! -Yes!

140
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:41,643
Quiet. Somebody's coming.

141
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:46,143
Is Kogoro Mouri a detective?

142
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,543
Yeah, I think he hired him.

143
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,143
I heard him on the phone.

144
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:53,843
Hey, who do you think dropped it?

145
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:54,943
Beats me.

146
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:57,743
But if you plan on doing anything, you've got to use your head a bit more.

147
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:58,943
True.

148
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:02,643
If both of us work together, it'll be easy and unfailing.

149
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,743
Hey!

150
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,743
Cut out that stupid talk!

151
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:11,043
It's true that the troupe leader has a personality flaw,

152
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,043
but we're making a living

153
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,643
thanks to him.

154
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:18,343
Yes. We've got to be grateful to him.

155
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,843
Just what are you talking about?

156
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,543
The only reason why you're sticking up for him

157
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,043
is because you're borrowing money from him, right?

158
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,943
Shut up.

159
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,343
Even you, Kazuma.

160
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,943
I know that deep down inside you hate him

161
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:34,543
because he won't let you be on stage as a magician yet.

162
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:36,643
I don't hate him or anything.

163
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,143
Then, let's go.

164
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,543
Yeah.

165
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:42,943
I don't care what you're doing, but why don't you at least shave?

166
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,543
You look like a vagabond.

167
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,743
Please wait!

168
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:53,043
Just who do you think you are?

169
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,043
Darn it!

170
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,843
Are you okay, Pops?

171
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:10,243
Of course I'm not okay.

172
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,043
What a bummer.

173
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:16,143
Pops, to do that magic,

174
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:18,543
you're supposed to lie on your back and hold your knees with your hands.

175
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,843
What? Lie on my back and hold my knees with my hands?

176
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:26,843
Then, you'll be okay even if the box were cut into two, right?

177
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,543
I see.

178
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:34,843
Now we know that all the troupe members have a motive to kill Mr. Fuyuki.

179
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,543
I've got to be very careful in handling this case.

180
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:38,843
All right!

181
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,243
Did you check what kind of trick was used for the magic?

182
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:44,243
I couldn't tell even if I did check.

183
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,343
Come on, let's go!

184
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,543
Oh, I see.

185
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:56,343
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

186
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:02,343
Ladies and gentlemen,

187
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:05,343
thank you for coming to "Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show".

188
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:08,243
Please enjoy the magical world of mysterious illusion tonight

189
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:10,543
to your heart's content!

190
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:14,543
It seems that she is enjoying herself.

191
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:46,243
Oh, no.

192
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,643
Oh, no.

193
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,443
Impossible!

194
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:01,943
I'm glad.

195
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,143
Fantastic, isn't it, Dad?

196
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:38,143
Yeah, he's indeed a master of knife throwing.

197
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:41,643
All Mr. Fuyuki is doing is pretending to throw knives.

198
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:42,743
What?

199
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:45,243
But the knives really poked in.

200
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,943
It only looks that way

201
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,443
by using a special trick.

202
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,343
I saw them do it a while ago,

203
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,143
at the warehouse backstage.

204
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,743
While I was hiding together with Pops.

205
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,343
Dad?

206
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,843
Look! The next one is about to start.

207
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:16,843
Those needles are real.

208
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:20,043
You don't have a chance if you're skewered with something like that.

209
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:24,443
That belt is just fixed on using magic tape.

210
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,243
After he is covered with the curtains,

211
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:29,143
he escapes to the small space besides the table.

212
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,643
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

213
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,843
What?

214
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,043
It looked that way to me, too!

215
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:43,143
Wait!

216
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:10,058
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

217
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:11,158
What?

218
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:12,558
It looked that way to me, too!

219
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,658
Wait!

220
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:22,858
Mr. Fuyuki!

221
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,558
Conan!

222
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:32,858
Mr. Fuyuki!

223
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,258
Well, well.

224
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:56,058
Aren't you the famed detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

225
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,158
And? Did something happen?

226
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:02,658
No, well...

227
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:04,258
It seems that Mr. Mouri

228
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:09,658
has ran up here thinking that these two beauties here have killed me.

229
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:11,558
But please don't worry,

230
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:14,958
because as you can see, I am alive.

231
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,558
It seems so.

232
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:22,658
But I have to be on guard,

233
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:26,358
because there's more life risking magic during the second half of the show.

234
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,658
I'm counting on you.

235
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:30,258
Well, sure.

236
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,558
Ladies and gentlemen,

237
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,258
please give Mr. Mouri a big hand!

238
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,258
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:42,258
"Genyo Fuyuki" -I am so sorry for the trouble.

240
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:46,258
I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of my signal,

241
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:48,458
so I decided to try it out.

242
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,158
There are things you should and should not do.

243
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:53,858
Thanks to you, I've been greatly embarrassed.

244
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:58,358
I'm sorry, but what I said on stage is true.

245
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:00,758
There will be danger on the start of the second half show.

246
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,358
Fuyuki, what was that magic all about?

247
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,958
Nothing in my stage directing plans

248
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,358
call for such screaming and blood splattering out.

249
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,958
I thought that up.

250
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,558
Thanks to that, I was able to deceive a famed detective, right?

251
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:20,258
That's a different story.

252
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:24,558
I thought you were taken by a demon or something.

253
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:25,958
Kazuma.

254
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,058
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,558
From now on,

256
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,758
I will not only perform a flamboyant or elegant stage,

257
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,558
but rather an even more exciting stage performance.

258
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,658
Yes, that's what I'll do.

259
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,758
Okay, suit yourself.

260
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:49,258
Your performance is not exciting,

261
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:50,658
but just grotesque!

262
00:17:54,758 --> 00:17:57,158
I'm sorry for the unpleasant confrontation.

263
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,058
Do you want anything?

264
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,258
It's nothing.

265
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:25,158
I wonder where Conan is?

266
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:27,858
He hasn't come back from the restroom.

267
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,058
Never mind him.

268
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:31,858
Keep your eyes on Mr. Fuyuki though.

269
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,658
For some reason, I have a strange feeling about this.

270
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:42,258
From here, I can immediately see if something goes wrong.

271
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:02,158
Sonny, you shouldn't be watching from here.

272
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,358
Go back to your seat.

273
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,058
But...

274
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,358
Now.

275
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:08,658
All right.

276
00:19:58,258 --> 00:19:59,258
Dad.

277
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:01,158
No, that's his performance.

278
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,458
He's not giving any signal.

279
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:34,658
Hey, it's taking too long.

280
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:37,958
Don't worry, it's that kind of magic.

281
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,358
I think.

282
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,358
When the curtain goes up again,

283
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:44,058
Mr. Fuyuki should be standing on top of the aquarium.

284
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,458
What the...

285
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,558
Shoots!

286
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:09,758
Shoots!

287
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,958
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

288
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,158
Just what are you doing?

289
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,958
Hurry and unlock the lid!

290
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,658
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

291
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:32,758
Hasegawa, pull up the lid!

292
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,858
Did something happen?

293
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:47,058
The ambulance!

294
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:49,058
-Call the ambulance! -Yes, sir!

295
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:53,658
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

296
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,258
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

297
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,658
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

298
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,858
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

299
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:13,158
Leader...

300
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:14,858
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

301
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:16,358
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

302
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,458
Mr. Fuyuki!

303
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,458
-Leader! -Get a hold of yourself, Fuyuki!

304
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,958
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

305
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,520
Next Conan's Hint:

306
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,520
"Latch"

307
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,780
In the next episode, the trick is revealed!

308
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,220
Is it murder or is it magic?

309
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
I'm not telling you.
