1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,987
What? You have an appointment with someone?

2
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,273
Right now?

3
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:11,373
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:13,573
Since you called for us to come at this hour,

5
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:17,173
I was sure we were going out to have dinner.

6
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,473
Dad just happens to be out

7
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:21,573
drinking with the master of Poirot and the others.

8
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:24,003
Well, it can't be helped.

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,973
There's someone I wanted you to meet.

10
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:32,011
"Mouri Detective Agency" -All right, looks like it's time to go.

11
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:38,373
It's fax.

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,373
What's this about?

13
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:48,027
No way!

14
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,773
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

15
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,033
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

16
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,573
A three-way battle among a woman judo champion, Kogoro and Eri.

17
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,273
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:01,273
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:03,373
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

20
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:46,145
"Might Over Mystery (Part 1)"

21
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,926
Troubled by a stalker?

22
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:51,426
Your acquaintance, Mom?

23
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:55,526
Well... Her husband was taken to court in the past,

24
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:59,826
in order to settle a traffic accident.

25
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:03,426
Oh, remember the judo player Yuko Arisawa!

26
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,726
You know her, don't you?

27
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,326
I do, I do!

28
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:08,726
They say that, if she hadn't got injured,

29
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:11,726
she would have won a gold medal at the Olympics!

30
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:15,626
She's the former All-Japan champion for the 70kg class, right?

31
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:19,426
But if it's her, wouldn't the stalker be the one running away?

32
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:22,826
No. Even though she was the one who approached me,

33
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:25,126
it was her husband that was concerned.

34
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:26,185
What?

35
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,926
He was suddenly on edge,

36
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:31,526
and noted that ever since the traffic accident,

37
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,226
it seemed like someone was always watching him.

38
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,626
It seems he isn't sleeping at night, either.

39
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:40,199
Then, maybe the stalker's the victim of the traffic accident?

40
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,201
I'm not convinced that's the case.

41
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,826
The victim came to a mutual understanding

42
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:48,207
that it had been his own fault, and settled privately.

43
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:52,626
Also, it seems the victim has completely recovered from his injuries.

44
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:55,426
Then, who is the stalker?

45
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:57,826
She tried to convince him otherwise,

46
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:01,326
and even told him, "It's probably your imagination",

47
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,223
but he won't listen to her.

48
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,826
That's why she wants me to come.

49
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,726
If there aren't any wiretaps or cameras,

50
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:13,326
we can prove there isn't a stalker.

51
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:16,526
But why are you going, Ms. Kisaki?

52
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,826
I wonder. Her husband seemed very grateful

53
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,626
during the settlement proceedings before,

54
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,726
so she probably thought that he would believe what I tell him.

55
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:28,247
No, that's not what I mean.

56
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,426
Huh?

57
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:33,426
I mean, why didn't you ask Pops to handle the case?

58
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,726
-What? -That's right...

59
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:39,326
Mom is a lawyer! Dad is a detective!

60
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,726
If it's a stalker case, a detective is...

61
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,726
Because I didn't want to!

62
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,826
Isn't that reason enough?

63
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:49,726
Of course that's not "enough" at all!

64
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:53,326
Well, considering the things Pops usually does...

65
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,126
Strike!

66
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:57,426
Oh, no!

67
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:58,826
Jackpot!

68
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:01,226
It may just be a waste of time asking him to do the job.

69
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,426
What's this?

70
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,526
While you have no problem coming to another's defense,

71
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:09,526
you won't intercede when it comes to your personal affairs, huh.

72
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,826
"Yuko Arisawa (37)" -Don't you think it's time

73
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:14,026
"Judo player" -for you to forgive your husband, Ms. Kisaki?

74
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,326
Yuko Arisawa! It's really her!

75
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:20,299
I'm afraid that's impossible for the time being.

76
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:25,926
Before I do, I'll wait for him to demonstrate his sincerity.

77
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,826
Then, why not go on and divorce him?

78
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,826
No, well, that's...

79
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:33,126
Well, at least he was able to give you a lovely daughter.

80
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,826
I guess it's not that easy.

81
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:39,126
Oh, my. Did you have a son as well?

82
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:42,826
No, he's a boy of our acquaintance who's staying with us for now.

83
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:47,026
Well, at any rate, shall we head over to your house?

84
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,926
I'm sure your husband is waiting, too.

85
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:52,126
Yes, you're right.

86
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,333
Since it's about time for him to return from the office,

87
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,335
so I'll give him a call.

88
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,326
That's strange.

89
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,126
No answer.

90
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:11,726
Could he be taking a bath?

91
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,726
Oh, dear.

92
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,526
Where are you?

93
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:16,826
I'm at a wake.

94
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,026
What? A wake?

95
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:22,026
Yeah, someone I know passed away,

96
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:24,363
so I came to his wake.

97
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,926
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

98
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,726
The speaker phone?

99
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:32,826
So yeah, I'll be home late so go to bed ahead of me.

100
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,926
Ahead of you? It's tonight, you know!

101
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:40,126
Lawyer Kisaki is coming over now to discuss the stalker problem.

102
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:42,381
Was that today?

103
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,383
I'm at Lawyer Kisaki's office right now.

104
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:47,626
I'll put her on!

105
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:51,726
Yes, this is Kisaki speaking.

106
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,426
Well, no...

107
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:54,726
If it's truly an inconvenience,

108
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:58,397
we can meet on a more suitable day.

109
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:02,426
Yes.

110
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:06,126
Is that so? We will review the situation then.

111
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,126
How was he?

112
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:12,411
He said he'll be arriving home at 9:25,

113
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,413
so I'll meet with him then.

114
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,826
25 minutes later... That's really peculiar, isn't it?

115
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:20,926
Normally, wouldn't you say 9:00 or 9:30?

116
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:24,026
He's just really punctual.

117
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,726
He's rarely late for anything without a reason.

118
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,726
It does seem like he completely forgot

119
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:32,431
about Lawyer Kisaki coming over tonight, though.

120
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:36,126
Furthermore, we still have another two hours until 9:30.

121
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:40,439
Then, how about if we have dinner at a nearby hotel restaurant?

122
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,726
Actually, while I were killing time in the cafe until the appointment,

123
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:48,726
my car was in the parking lot of the hotel.

124
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:51,326
Not to mention, the parking fee will be cheaper.

125
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:54,453
In that case, is it all right if these two come along?

126
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,126
Why, of course!

127
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,726
You won the karate tournament championship!

128
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:04,026
That's amazing, Ran!

129
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,926
Thank you very much.

130
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,467
But didn't you do so, as well?

131
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:12,471
No. My talent developed later on!

132
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,926
I was first crowned a champion in university.

133
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:18,477
Given the comparatively high injury rate,

134
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,226
my peak lasted only two, three years.

135
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:24,126
And after retiring, I got married.

136
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:27,926
I still haven't been able to achieve my dream of earning the gold medal

137
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:30,126
in front of the superior I admired so much.

138
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:32,491
The superior you admired?

139
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:36,495
He's currently the coach for the all Japan team, Hajime Kajimoto.

140
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:40,499
At one time, he was an unrivalled gold medalist in the 81kg class.

141
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:46,505
I took up judo after seeing him on TV.

142
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,507
It's the same as me, then.

143
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:53,626
I admire the karate champion of Japan.

144
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:56,515
But admiration is admiration.

145
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,426
It's the same as viewing flower from afar.

146
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:01,326
When you get too close,

147
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,326
it becomes like Icarus who lost his wings

148
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:06,126
and plunged to the earth after flying too close to the sun.

149
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,527
Disaster befalls oneself.

150
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,426
I'm sorry to drop that remark.

151
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:14,533
No.

152
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,537
-But I'm glad I brought Ran with me. -What?

153
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:22,541
I called you to my office so that you could see her.

154
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,026
Since you both practice martial arts,

155
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:28,547
I figured you'd both have something in common.

156
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:32,326
I didn't think we'd be having dinner together though.

157
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,026
Then, why didn't you call Dad as well?

158
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,326
Dad actually practiced judo!

159
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,726
Now that you mentioned it, I suppose he did.

160
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,326
The truth is, I was worried.

161
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:43,326
What?

162
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,626
I wasn't sure whether or not he was on a case,

163
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,526
so I decided against using the hand of such a renowned detective.

164
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,326
Is that so?

165
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:55,326
If that's the case, you should have mentioned it from the start!

166
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,726
Well, didn't I mention it?

167
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,326
-Say? -Yes, what?

168
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:02,126
Isn't it about time to go?

169
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:04,583
You said it would take ten minutes

170
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,585
to get to your house by car, right?

171
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,926
That's true.

172
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,126
But before we go, I need to go to the bathroom.

173
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:18,226
Wasn't it delicious, that blend of western and Japanese style food?

174
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,926
Yes, absolutely.

175
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,826
Do you come here often?

176
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,626
Yeah, I make sure I come once a week!

177
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,326
With your husband, right?

178
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,626
Nope, I come alone without telling him.

179
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:32,026
My husband has zero tolerance for new food.

180
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,126
Oh, yeah?

181
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:37,326
Let's see, where did I park?

182
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:42,621
Isn't it that white car?

183
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,623
When I saw you with your husband before,

184
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,626
that's the car you were driving, right?

185
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,626
Yep, yep! That's it!

186
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:54,626
Then, I'll give Ran and the boy a ride as well.

187
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:58,226
We'll pass right by the detective agency on the way home.

188
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:00,226
Thank you very much.

189
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:05,826
You know how to adjust the seat, don't you?

190
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,326
There's a lever on the right side of the seat.

191
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,647
And if you pull it...

192
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:12,651
See, like this, the seat will move.

193
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:16,026
No need to worry, my car has the same thing.

194
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,526
Well, sonny,

195
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:24,326
we'll get there right away so stay put, okay?

196
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:38,026
Huh? The parking ticket...

197
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,126
Where did I put it?

198
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:44,126
I'm afraid you'll have to pay the daily maximum of 3,000 yen.

199
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,926
Guess it can't be helped.

200
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:48,426
If you don't mind, I'll gladly pay half.

201
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:51,426
It's fine, because it's my fault.

202
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,126
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,326
The children are truly being an inconvenience.

204
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,701
Not at all.

205
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:06,705
It's because you insisted on having it your way, Conan.

206
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,626
Because, if she's the former All-Japan champion,

207
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:12,426
she must have a lot of trophies and plaques, right?

208
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:15,126
Don't you wanna see them too, Ran?

209
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,626
Well, I suppose so, but...

210
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,026
I'm home!

211
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:22,426
Oh, my husband's shoes!

212
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,926
It's just 9:30.

213
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:29,626
I guess he really punctual.

214
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,326
Well, I'll go get my husband.

215
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,733
You can wait in our living room here.

216
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,026
Dear! Lawyer Kisaki is here!

217
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,726
No matter how you look at it, this is something.

218
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,926
Look at the number of these trophies and plaques!

219
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:45,326
Yeah, I know!

220
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:48,026
When she was in her prime, she never lost.

221
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,749
She was even said to be invincible!

222
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,751
Say, this picture...

223
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:57,126
See the tall man standing to the far right?

224
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:01,326
I think that's the gold medalist that she mentioned earlier.

225
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:05,026
Right, right. That's Hajime Kajimoto of the 81kg class.

226
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,226
Oh, and the other one, standing to her left.

227
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:11,826
That's Yuko's husband, Shiro Arisawa.

228
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:18,126
Then, the boy making the peace sign, is Arisawa's son?

229
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:22,781
No, that's Kajimoto's son, Kouta!

230
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:27,126
He would come along to the judo dojo where I worked as a coach.

231
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:30,526
He is really cute.

232
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,791
And, your husband?

233
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,626
The thing is, I can't find him anywhere.

234
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,926
He's not in the bath or bathroom either.

235
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:42,226
He might have gone out for cigarettes after getting home.

236
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:44,803
I'll try to get him on his cell.

237
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:51,826
A ringtone...

238
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,426
You hear it, too?

239
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:56,126
Don't cut the phone!

240
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,726
Conan!

241
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,226
Could it be inside this closet?

242
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:14,326
Dear!

243
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,845
The victim is Shiro Arisawa, age 37.

244
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,849
He was a businessman that worked for Haido Co.

245
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,280
This is his residence.

246
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,580
And Yuko Arisawa.

247
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,280
Are you sure he is your husband?

248
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Yes, very sure.

249
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,580
It appears that some sort of rope was used to strangle him to death.

250
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,867
Absolutely. We haven't found the weapon yet.

251
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,080
It was likely something along the line of a thin cloth.

252
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,780
Like a tie, right?

253
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,880
-What? -What?

254
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,875
Because before, on the phone...

255
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,380
He said, "I'm at a wake",

256
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,180
so shouldn't he have a tie?

257
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,980
Usually, when men go to a wake,

258
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,080
don't they wear suits with a black tie?

259
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,280
That's true.

260
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,380
This raises the possibility of the culprit

261
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,891
taking the victim's tie and using it as a weapon.

262
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,880
And, do you know whose wake it was?

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,280
Well, all my husband said on the phone

264
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,680
was that someone he knew passed away suddenly.

265
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,480
And I think I heard chanting in the background.

266
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
What? Ran, you spoke with the victim on the phone as well?

267
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,280
No. While I was speaking with my husband on the phone,

268
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,780
my fingers slipped and hit the speaker button.

269
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,180
That's why we heard it as well.

270
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,580
But why were you and the children with her

271
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
while she was speaking to the victim?

272
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Actually...

273
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,780
The victim was her husband, Shiro, who had consulted with me

274
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,180
on settling a traffic accident in the past.

275
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,380
Ever since the accident, he had been plagued by a stalker,

276
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,480
which led her to consulting with me again.

277
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,945
Her husband had been saying that

278
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,280
he felt as if "someone was always watching him".

279
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,980
But personally,

280
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,680
I never felt there was any indication of anything like that

281
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,380
so I had our old lawyer, Ms. Kisaki visit our us.

282
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,280
Since my husband has such great faith in Ms. Kisaki,

283
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,880
I thought that, if she could prove

284
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,967
there weren't any wire taps or cameras anywhere,

285
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:33,780
it might put his mind at rest.

286
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,280
Also, prior to leaving Ms. Kisaki's office by car,

287
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,680
as this boy said earlier,

288
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,380
my husband told me that he was at a wake.

289
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,780
And her husband told her over the phone

290
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,780
at time that he would be back around 9:30.

291
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Until then, we were at a nearby restaurant,

292
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,980
with the children and ate there.

293
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,080
Then we came here in her car afterwards.

294
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,980
Do you know what time it was?

295
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,180
Let's see, it was...

296
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,005
She called her husband at around 7:30 in the evening,

297
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,380
and we went to the hotel immediately.

298
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,180
So, by the time we finished our meal and left, it was around 9:00.

299
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,280
When we got here, it was almost exactly 9:30.

300
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,280
And then, somehow, you came across the body in the closet?

301
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,580
Yeah, since I couldn't find him,

302
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,027
I called his cell phone and...

303
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,980
We heard ring tone from the closet.

304
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,380
Which amounts to...

305
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,039
Your husband claimed he wouldn't be home until 9:30,

306
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,980
but actually arrived thirty minutes early.

307
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,380
His estimated time of death is around 9:00 tonight.

308
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,180
So, at that time, he must have already been home.

309
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,580
That means, there's a chance that the stalker is still somewhere nearby.

310
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,380
The culprit had been lying in wait,

311
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,063
for her husband to return.

312
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,680
About your husband's stalker...

313
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,580
Did you have nothing of the situation?

314
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,780
No, at all.

315
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,780
Not being a fan of hers, it's unlikely that you'll understand.

316
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,080
What?

317
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
A fan of hers?

318
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,380
Oh, don't you recognize her?

319
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,180
She is the former All-Japan champion of judo in the 70kg class.

320
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,880
This is Yuko Arisawa.

321
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,091
It really is her!

322
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,780
I thought I'd seen her face somewhere!

323
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,880
Thanks.

324
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,080
But it's strange for a guy to be so worried about a stalker

325
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,880
when he has such an able-bodied bodyguard like her.

326
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,780
That's true.

327
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,105
After thinking about it,

328
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,780
it could be the victim from that traffic accident.

329
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,880
I'm not so sure that's the case.

330
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,980
They might have just been after the money.

331
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,115
Conan!

332
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,117
Cause look down here!

333
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,580
At this person's left ring finger!

334
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,180
It looks like one was there before.

335
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,880
But now there's no ring!

336
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,125
It's true.

337
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,680
Isn't the left finger for wedding bands?

338
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,131
Did your husband always wear his wedding ring?

339
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,780
Yeah.

340
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,880
But that's weird!

341
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,780
Even though the ring is gone,

342
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,141
this fancy-looking watch is still here!

343
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,780
Why is it?

344
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,780
I'm so sorry. I should be keeping a better eye on him.

345
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,151
Since it's still here, their motive wasn't money after all, huh?

346
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,780
Guess not.

347
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,080
At any rate,

348
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,880
for time being, we'll concentrate on inspecting the house.

349
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,480
While we do, will all of you please wait in another room.

350
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,980
To think all of this started while looking into a stalker...

351
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
I feel sorry for Yuko.

352
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,080
Yes, I guess so.

353
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,380
I don't want to conclude that she planned the murder already.

354
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,680
What?

355
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,780
Are you trying to say Yuko is the culprit?

356
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,880
Yeah, it's certainly a possibility, isn't it?

357
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,780
But her husband was killed around 9:00 tonight.

358
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,195
That's the same time we left the hotel restaurant.

359
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,280
Wasn't Yuko with us the entire time?

360
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,080
But she excused herself to the bathroom once, didn't she?

361
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Just before we left the restaurant.

362
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,980
But it was only for around ten minutes.

363
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,980
Her husband was at a wake then.

364
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,680
Are you saying that she would tell him to come to the hotel

365
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,213
despite knowing what she did?

366
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,215
No, that's not it.

367
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:42,380
When Officer Takagi checked the call history on her phone,

368
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,380
it said that last call she made was at 7:30, which was from my office.

369
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,680
Then, how could Yuko be the culprit?

370
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,580
The call from my office could have been fabricated.

371
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,780
What?

372
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,241
By then, shouldn't he have already been home, normally?

373
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:07,245
But this time, when she called her husband,

374
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,980
she went for his cell instead of the home phone.

375
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,780
Isn't that suspicious?

376
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,280
What's more, I think she purposely put it on speaker,

377
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,257
just so we could hear the conversation.

378
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,480
What? A wake?

379
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,780
Yeah. Someone I know suddenly passed away.

380
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,880
You're thinking about it too much.

381
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,271
Because after that, didn't she let you speak to him?

382
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,180
The voice on the phone was that of her husband, right?

383
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,480
Yeah. I doubt there was a trick involved there.

384
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
That's true.

385
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,680
If his voice had been recorded beforehand

386
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,380
and it was just played back over the phone,

387
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,280
she could easily fake a conversation that way.

388
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,880
But it would've been 100% impossible

389
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,295
to hold a conversation with Ms. Kisaki after that.

390
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:01,080
Someone could have imitated his voice over the phone.

391
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,280
After meeting with her so many times during the settlement proceedings,

392
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,580
she would be hard to fool.

393
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,380
If she really did call her husband then...

394
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm at a wake.

395
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,780
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

396
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,480
Without knowing where the wake was being held...

397
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,980
Could Arisawa really have planned to murder him?

398
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,411
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,194
"The sound of Mahjong"

400
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,178
In the next episode, Dad is really on his toes!

401
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,417
No way! Seriously?

402
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,840
Ron!
