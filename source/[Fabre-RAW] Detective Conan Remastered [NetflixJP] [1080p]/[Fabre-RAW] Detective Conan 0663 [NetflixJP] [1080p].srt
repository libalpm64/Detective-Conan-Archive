1
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:09,329
Cool! Let me touch it too.

2
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,729
It's so thorny. I guess it hurts.

3
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,993
Dad got it for me at the department store!

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:19,029
I've got a stag beetle at home too! -How lucky.

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,001
It's meaningless if you don't go and catch them yourself!

6
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:25,229
But, I'd like to have a beetle too.

7
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:26,429
Yeah.

8
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,529
Beetle?

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,011
So that's what you want?

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,013
You're a kid after all.

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:38,029
You can catch as many beetles as you want.

12
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:39,629
Really?

13
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,029
You're gonna get it if it's a lie!

14
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:46,429
Yeah, an old friend of mine lives in Yamanashi, you see.

15
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,029
He's been asking me to go and see him.

16
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:53,529
If we go there, you can catch as many beetles as you like.

17
00:00:53,529 --> 00:01:00,039
And so, we decided to go visit Doc's old friend.

18
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,829
Talk about going into the mountains.

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,429
For sure, we'll be able to catch lots of beetles and stag beetles here!

20
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:08,629
Absolutely!

21
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:12,829
Maybe we'll even find a Giant Hercules Beetle!

22
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:14,729
Wow!

23
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,029
No, we won't.

24
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,729
If all cases were men,

25
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,429
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

26
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,629
Beetles, stag beetles and Buddhist statues?

27
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,129
The detective squad goes on an all out investigation.

28
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,729
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,529
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:48,929
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,761
"Pursue the Miyama Stag Beetle"

32
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:29,761
He said he'd come to pick us up, but...

33
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:32,191
There isn't even a convenience store in sight.

34
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,061
There aren't any vending machines either.

35
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,061
Agasa.

36
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,861
Ryutaro, long time no see!

37
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:41,561
How are you doing?

38
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,203
I'm doing just great!

39
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,461
Let me introduce.

40
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,467
He's my friend, Ryutaro Namatame.

41
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,794
"Ryutaro Namatame (52)" -Thanks for coming all the way here, kids.

42
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:52,211
Welcome.

43
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,794
-We'll be in your care! -We'll be in your care!

44
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:58,217
You said that your house is located at the foot of the mountain.

45
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,994
Is it far from here?

46
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:03,794
No, it's just about an hour from here by car.

47
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,494
Well, I'm dying of thirst.

48
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:09,194
Can I get something to drink?

49
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:11,794
What a nuisance of a brat.

50
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:12,894
Follow me.

51
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,394
"Roadside Resting Place"

52
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,994
I'll have coke.

53
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:25,294
I want a large serving of soft ice cream cone!

54
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:27,994
I'll have... What should I have?

55
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:31,594
Hey, Kei!

56
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,494
Seeing that you're having lunch here,

57
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:36,994
it must mean that you went to play pachinko again.

58
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,694
No... No way!

59
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:41,094
"Kei Yabe (27)" -Geez, how rude!

60
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,261
I brought some watermelons

61
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:45,494
that I grew here to the direct sales store.

62
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,194
I doubt that.

63
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,694
Don't you ever get into debt again

64
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:51,194
and make your mother suffer again.

65
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,194
I know.

66
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:56,275
It's a beetle. How large!

67
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,494
There's a Miyama stag beetle too. Awesome!

68
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:01,294
Hey!

69
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:04,894
That's not for sale. Don't touch it!

70
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,794
"Shuhei Ikeda (50)" -Someone from a department store in Tokyo

71
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:08,294
is going to come to purchase them.

72
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:10,594
I can't sell them if they become weak!

73
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:14,293
Shuhei, they were just looking at the beetles.

74
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,094
Why all the fuss?

75
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:18,794
Ryutaro, are they your acquaintances?

76
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:22,794
Yeah, they're my guests from Tokyo.

77
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,303
Don't go into our mountains

78
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:27,094
just because you want beetles now.

79
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,394
What a warm welcome after we just got here.

80
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:34,094
Oh, my! How cute!

81
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:35,794
Sorry about that.

82
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,894
Shuhei's always been stingy and suspicious of others

83
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,794
ever since he was a child.

84
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:44,323
Moreover, we're having issues regarding the border of the land we own.

85
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,325
You're having issues regarding the land?

86
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:49,394
Does that mean you're rich, sir?

87
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,994
Don't be silly.

88
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:53,894
Well, since I own a farm, I won't starve,

89
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,594
but I have no money at all.

90
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:58,694
But, we can all sleep over here, can't we?

91
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:02,994
Although it's an old house, there are many rooms, so don't worry.

92
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:06,694
Well, there are also a lot of old junk.

93
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:08,347
The antique shop dealer that came the other day

94
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,994
said that the statue of Buddha that I put on the alcove

95
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:14,353
was something from the Kamakura era.

96
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,355
I'll take this!

97
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,094
Okay, thank you very much!

98
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:30,369
This picture is sort of frightening.

99
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,194
As expected of ignorant children.

100
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:36,375
It could be a piece drawn by Okyo Maruyama, you know.

101
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,994
And that statue of Buddha may have been made by Unkei.

102
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,394
It can't be...

103
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:46,994
Never mind that. Let's hurry and go!

104
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:48,394
Yeah!

105
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,394
I have to catch a stag beetle no matter what

106
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,794
and brag about it to everybody in class!

107
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:53,794
Yeah!

108
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:01,594
Shall we start around here?

109
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:03,394
Are the beetles here?

110
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:06,194
I'm not sure, but beetles and stag beetles

111
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:09,794
like to hang around oak trees like these.

112
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:10,994
It stinks of liquor.

113
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:14,413
Did you put the banana we got and soaked it in this?

114
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,994
Never mind that. Just spread the stocking, will you?

115
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,417
Yes, sure.

116
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,994
Since you told me to bring some old stockings,

117
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,894
I was wondering what you were going to use it for.

118
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:25,594
I guess this was it.

119
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:29,594
Dad asked me if I was going to play cops and robbers.

120
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:32,794
Are you sure we can catch them with something like this?

121
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,794
We'll find out at night.

122
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,094
Okay, this should do it.

123
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:37,794
How many more should we set up?

124
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:42,194
How I wish night time would come quickly.

125
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:46,194
Huh?

126
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:48,447
What's that tool for?

127
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,394
I wonder what someone would be doing in a place like this.

128
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:53,794
The car keys are still in the truck.

129
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,455
Hey! What the heck are you looking at? -What?

130
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,594
Well. You see...

131
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:02,094
It's the guy who plays pachinko.

132
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:04,463
Didn't I tell you I didn't play?

133
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:07,294
What are you guys doing in a place like this?

134
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:09,994
We came to catch beetles.

135
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:12,194
Don't you dare come near my truck.

136
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:13,794
Scat!

137
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,194
We were just looking around.

138
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:17,694
Get out of here right this minute!

139
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:19,694
If you don't, I'm giving you guys a licking!

140
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,994
Let's go. -Okay, okay.

141
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:25,994
He didn't have to get so angry.

142
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:29,194
I wonder if there was something he didn't want us to see?

143
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:30,489
What did you just say?

144
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:39,194
You're still making those weird inventions of yours.

145
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:41,694
Calling them weird is unnecessary, I think.

146
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:47,394
I think it's about time.

147
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,794
I guess so.

148
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,194
I think you'll be okay,

149
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,094
but be careful because there are snakes around here.

150
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:54,513
What?

151
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,515
Letting the children go on their own worries me,

152
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,517
so I guess I'll go with them after all.

153
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,894
Ryutaro, you go ahead and sleep without me.

154
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:01,894
Okay.

155
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,094
Wow!

156
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,894
It's beetles! The beetles are here!

157
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:10,094
Awesome! Let me catch them!

158
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:12,531
I did it!

159
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:16,294
Okay. Let's go catch some more!

160
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,094
There's a giant stag beetle here!

161
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:21,994
Look! A saw tooth stag beetle!

162
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:26,194
Awesome! This is the first time I've seen something like this!

163
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:27,694
Look at this one!

164
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,894
This one is bigger.

165
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:32,294
Let's make them compete as soon as we get home!

166
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,553
Yes! -I can't wait!

167
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:37,494
I tell you.

168
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:41,294
That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him.

169
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,694
He's doing sneaky things behind my back.

170
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:45,594
I won't let him get away with this.

171
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,994
That's the man we saw this afternoon.

172
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:50,894
Someone from a department store in Tokyo

173
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,571
is going to come to purchase them.

174
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,294
I can't sell them if they become weak!

175
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,094
He's the man we saw at the roadside resting place.

176
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:01,194
He was saying something about Ryutaro.

177
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,994
Big catch, big catch!

178
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,094
That is what fishermen say.

179
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:08,587
It seems he's still awake.

180
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:11,794
Strange. The paper sliding door is open.

181
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:18,597
Sir, please get a hold of yourself!

182
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,794
What happened?

183
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:21,194
Ryutaro!

184
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,094
Sir!

185
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:26,294
Sir, we'll call the ambulance right away.

186
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:32,611
Miyama... Stag Beetle...

187
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,613
Did you say Miyama stag beetle?

188
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,194
What do you mean?

189
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:39,994
Ai, call an ambulance!

190
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,194
Yes!

191
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,094
Huh? -What's the matter?

192
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,394
The statue of Buddha that was here is gone.

193
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,294
Just hurry and call the ambulance first.

194
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:52,994
Yes.

195
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:54,394
We're out of the service area!

196
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,394
What's this?

197
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:05,994
Anyway, I wonder

198
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:08,647
what he meant by saying "Miyama stag beetle".

199
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:17,684
Mr. Namatame was taken to the hospital while unconscious.

200
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:20,659
And then, the police began their investigation.

201
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,184
"Detective Motohashi (45)" -Miyama stag beetle?

202
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,084
Did he really say that?

203
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,284
Yeah. -We heard him say so too.

204
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:29,384
Yeah...

205
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:32,184
"Detective Fuji (27)" -It's not something we'd expect one would say

206
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:33,784
just before passing out.

207
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:35,484
I wonder what it means.

208
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:36,675
Beats me.

209
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:39,984
There's one other thing that's bothering me.

210
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:42,681
What is it? -The statue of Buddha

211
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:46,684
that was there when we left has gone missing.

212
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:48,084
A statue of Buddha?

213
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,384
Come to think of it, there have been a series of statues

214
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:53,284
being stolen from temples in this prefecture.

215
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,884
The robber broke in to steal the statue

216
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,484
and ran into the victim,

217
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,184
then struck him with the vase that was there.

218
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:02,084
I guess that's what happened. -Yeah.

219
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:03,984
Excuse me.

220
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:07,084
This was found on Mr. Namatame's clothes.

221
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,707
It's some sort of hair.

222
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,684
Give it to forensics team. -Yes, sir.

223
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:16,715
I wonder why Ryutaro mentioned Miyama stag beetle.

224
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,784
There's no way that a Miyama stag beetle could be the culprit.

225
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:24,384
Hey. We saw that man on our way back, didn't we?

226
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:28,727
That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him.

227
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:33,084
He had a Miyama stag beetle at the roadside resting place!

228
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:35,184
Do you know his name?

229
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:38,084
Mr. Namatame called him Shuhei.

230
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:39,884
I think he's referring to

231
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,184
"Officer Iwanaga (55)" -Mr. Shuhei Ikeda who lives in this village.

232
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,745
Let go of me!

233
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,084
Just what the hell are you saying I did?

234
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,284
It seems that you had some issues with Mr. Namatame

235
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,184
regarding where the border of your land is.

236
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,384
Yeah, that place has been our land since the time of my ancestors.

237
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,584
He had the nerve to turn it into a field without permission.

238
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,084
But I didn't attack him!

239
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:05,084
Where were you at around 12 am last night?

240
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,284
12 am? -He was walking along the road.

241
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:09,684
He looked really angry and was saying,

242
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:13,384
"That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him."

243
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:14,773
Well, that's...

244
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,784
Is that true?

245
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:18,084
I went on my routine check around the area

246
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:20,384
and found that the water of the field was turned off.

247
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,184
I figured that only Ryutaro would do something like that

248
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:26,584
and thought I'd give him a piece of my mind the next time I see him!

249
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:29,684
I bet you gave him a piece of your mind last night, no?

250
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,791
No. I didn't do it.

251
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,793
Please believe me!

252
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,799
Sir, did you know that there was a statue of Buddha

253
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,084
in the alcove on the other side?

254
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,484
A statue of Buddha?

255
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,184
Yeah, there was a very dirty one there.

256
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:52,811
It seems that the culprit who attacked Mr. Namatame took it.

257
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,618
You're not the one, are you?

258
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,118
You mean the statue of Buddha?

259
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:58,817
I see, so a robber came to steal the statue.

260
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,618
If so, I know who might have done it.

261
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:02,821
Really?

262
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,218
It's Kei.

263
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,118
He has things like a fret saw and a grinder loaded in his truck

264
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,518
and goes out night after night.

265
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:10,829
So, I was thinking that something was fishy!

266
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,831
It's true that he had them in his truck.

267
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,018
Yeah. He was really angry at us because we saw them.

268
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:18,837
True, he was really angry.

269
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,839
Come to think of it,

270
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,843
he was wearing a T-shirt with the picture of a Miyama stag beetle on it.

271
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:30,618
Who is it?

272
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:31,918
We're the police.

273
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,318
We have something we'd like to ask you.

274
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,518
Could we ask you to come with us?

275
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:38,118
What the heck is it?

276
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,859
Just what did I do?

277
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,118
Where were you at about 12 am last night?

278
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,618
12 am?

279
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,918
Where else would I be if not at home?

280
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:48,867
That's a lie!

281
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:52,618
After I went to check around the field, I passed in front of your house,

282
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:54,518
but the truck wasn't there!

283
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,875
You broke into the house to steal the statue of Buddha,

284
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:00,318
but Mr. Namatame found you, so you hit him on the head and fled.

285
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:01,718
Isn't that what happened?

286
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,718
Hold it there!

287
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:06,885
If I came to steal something from here, I wouldn't come by truck.

288
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,518
Don't you think so? It's walking distance.

289
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:12,891
Then, where were you at around 12 am last night?

290
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,418
Well...

291
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:17,618
Either way, I didn't attack Mr. Namatame!

292
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,897
It's true!

293
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,418
Did you find out what the hair was?

294
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:24,618
Oh, yeah. It was a dog's hair.

295
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,318
Dog's hair?

296
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,518
I wonder what someone would be doing in a place like this.

297
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,018
The car keys are still in the truck.

298
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:40,618
Hey! What are you looking at? -What?

299
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,718
Just as I thought.

300
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,941
Neither of the two attacked Mr. Namatame.

301
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,918
If they didn't, who on earth did?

302
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:16,118
Are you blind or what?

303
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:18,518
It's you, Ai.

304
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:20,959
What do you mean, "It's you, Ai"?

305
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,961
Just what do you propose to do now?

306
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,118
Those two aren't the culprit.

307
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,818
But they're both connected to the Miyama stag beetle, aren't they?

308
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:30,969
If it were one of them,

309
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:32,971
I'm sure Mr. Namatame would've said their names.

310
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:36,518
Then, who on earth is the culprit?

311
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:38,977
I don't know. However,

312
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,318
the culprit who attacked Mr. Namatame

313
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:44,418
took the statue of Buddha, that's for sure.

314
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:46,418
I wonder if that dirty looking statue

315
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:48,987
is really worth any value.

316
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:50,218
Beats me.

317
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,991
He did say that it was made in the Kamakura era though.

318
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,718
Mr. Namatame mentioned that it may have been made by Unkei.

319
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,997
Well, though it's true that Unkei

320
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,999
made some items in the Kamakura era,

321
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,001
it could also have been made in the Heian era, right?

322
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,005
No, I'm sure I heard that it was from the Kamakura era.

323
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
I wonder where I heard that.

324
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:13,618
Well, there are also a lot of old junk.

325
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,418
The antique shop dealer that came the other day

326
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:17,918
said that the statue of Buddha that I put on the alcove

327
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:21,618
was something from the Kamakura era.

328
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,818
It was at that roadside resting place!

329
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,918
Ai, let's try going to the roadside resting place

330
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,025
that we passed by when coming here!

331
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,418
"Roadside Resting Place"

332
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:32,418
We came here yesterday, but do you remember us?

333
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,033
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

334
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,518
If you come up with anything...

335
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:41,418
Hi, madam. We came here yesterday. Do you remember us?

336
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,618
Yes, you're the ones who came along with Mr. Namatame, right?

337
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,418
I remember you.

338
00:17:46,418 --> 00:17:49,318
Do you remember if there was anyone else back then?

339
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,418
Well, let me see.

340
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:54,418
Oh, my! How cute!

341
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:58,018
There was a young couple.

342
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:01,059
Do you remember anything about them?

343
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,061
Not really.

344
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,618
All they did was buying a potted plant, you see.

345
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,918
What kind of potted plant was it?

346
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,518
This one.

347
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,071
It has an interesting name, don't you think?

348
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,318
It's a bit different from what we like though.

349
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,018
This is...

350
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:21,079
Oh, my God.

351
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,118
So, that's the story.

352
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:28,718
Didn't that young couple bring a dog with them?

353
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,818
Oh, I'm surprised you know that.

354
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,518
That's right.

355
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,818
I wonder where Conan and the others went?

356
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,818
Doc went with them too.

357
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,418
I hope they're not having lunch without us.

358
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:46,318
At any rate, we'll hear out

359
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,418
the rest of your story at the station.

360
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:52,718
I'm telling you, I have nothing to do with this.

361
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:56,318
Same here. -Hold it there.

362
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,115
Suddenly, just like that again...

363
00:18:57,318 --> 00:19:00,718
Those two aren't the culprit.

364
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:02,118
What?

365
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:06,918
Well, Kei is guilty of stealing a statue of Buddha, though.

366
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:08,218
Don't be ridiculous!

367
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:12,018
I looked beneath your truck.

368
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,133
The statue was tied onto it.

369
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,718
You went to some temple last night to steal it, right?

370
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:23,141
How can you be so sure

371
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,143
that these two didn't attack Mr. Namatame?

372
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,818
The reason is simple.

373
00:19:26,818 --> 00:19:30,118
If it were one of them, Ryutaro knows their name.

374
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,151
He would never have said, "Miyama stag beetle".

375
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,918
Maybe it was dark when he was suddenly attacked

376
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:38,718
that he couldn't see the culprit's face?

377
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:43,618
When we got back, the light of the Japanese room was on.

378
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:46,018
Ryutaro had gone to bed,

379
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,618
but noticed a sound and came to the Japanese room.

380
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,718
He was attacked after he switched on the light.

381
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:54,918
What if the culprit's face was hidden?

382
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:58,218
I'm sure that if it were one of the two,

383
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,618
Ryutaro would've been able to recognize them.

384
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:04,118
The fact is, on our way here yesterday,

385
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:06,118
we stopped by at a roadside resting place.

386
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:09,187
Ryutaro was bragging back then that stolen statue of Buddha

387
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:12,418
was something from the Kamakura era.

388
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:18,018
At the time, a couple who seemed like tourists were there.

389
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:23,201
That couple bought a potted plant at that roadside resting place.

390
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:25,618
This is the one.

391
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,018
-This is... -This is...

392
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,318
"Miyama Stag Beetle"

393
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,818
Right.

394
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:37,215
Miyama Stag Beetle was the name of this flower

395
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,918
and not the name of an insect.

396
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:43,918
Ryutaro saw the culprit, but he didn't know their name.

397
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:46,218
That's why he wanted to let us know that the culprit

398
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:50,818
was the one who bought the Miyama stag beetle potted plant.

399
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:54,118
Proof... Do you have proof?

400
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,418
According to the woman who sold them the plant,

401
00:20:57,718 --> 00:21:01,618
the couple had a Maltese with them.

402
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:03,241
A Maltese?

403
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:07,245
Dog hair was also found on Ryutaro's clothes.

404
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:11,249
A DNA test should clarify everything.

405
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:15,018
I'm sure that the couple is the culprit.

406
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:18,218
You can take over from here, officers.

407
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,718
After that, the police checked on

408
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:25,263
all hotels and pensions in the area where pets are allowed,

409
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:28,218
and the identity of the couple was revealed.

410
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:30,318
The couple who was arrested in Tokyo

411
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:32,418
heard that the statue was one that was made in the Kamakura era,

412
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:34,218
and thought that it could be sold at a high price.

413
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:36,818
That's why they tailed our car

414
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:40,318
and went to rob it from Mr. Namatame's house.

415
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:43,281
However, when they took the statue to an antique shop,

416
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,818
they were told that it wasn't made by Unkei or anyone special,

417
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:49,287
and was worth only 5,000 yen at most.

418
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,918
Meanwhile, Mr. Namatame recovered

419
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,618
and was discharged a few days later.

420
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,118
How about it? Fantastic, huh?

421
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,018
We caught it ourselves!

422
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,818
A giant stag beetle.

423
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:33,718
You mean the name of this plant is Miyama Stag Beetle?

424
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:35,393
Right.

425
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,418
Are you really going to give it to class?

426
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,718
Yeah, mother told me to show it to everyone in class

427
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:43,018
because it's a really rare flower.

428
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:45,118
Then, let's decide on who the watering monitor will be!

429
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:46,718
Great! How should we decide?

430
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,407
Too bad you couldn't brag about your beetles.

431
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,418
Yeah, you worked hard for nothing.

432
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,423
"Cigarette butts"

434
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,425
Today is the Star Festival Day.

435
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:08,706
When stars and wind fall.

436
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:10,480
That's a godsend.
