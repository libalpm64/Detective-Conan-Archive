1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,090
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,290
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,090
Another travel mystery for our fans.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,190
The puzzle is hidden in the beautiful scenery.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,790
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,890
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,600
Goodness. Dad, it's still morning and you're already drinking.

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
What's wrong with that?

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,700
After all, I did win our trip ticket at the shopping arcade lottery.

11
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,700
I know, "We were able to go on a trip because I won the lottery."

12
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,900
Isn't that what you want to say?

13
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,200
We've heard it so many times already.

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
Isn't that right, Conan?

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
That's right.

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Pops, you're a real genius at lotteries.

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,700
Not just at lotteries, at everything!

18
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
You think it'll go all right?

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,500
I mean he's the one who made all the arrangements.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't worry, Conan is very mature for his age.

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,100
As for you, dad, you're drinking too much.

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,700
All right...

23
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,800
"The Linked Poetry Incident At Tamatsukuri In Matsue (Part 1)"

24
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,400
This Matsue City is famous for its castle.

25
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
And for Lake Shinji.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,300
I hear the Lake Shinji Shitchin's are worth trying.

27
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,400
"Jouzan Inari Shrine" -What is Shitchin?

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,900
It refers to the sea bass,

29
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,100
Japanese ice fish, pond smelt, fresh water clam,

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,000
moroge shrimp, carp and eel,

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the seven delicacies caught in this lake.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,300
Collectively, they're called Shitchin.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,100
Matsue City also boasts Lafcadio Hearn known as Yakumo Koizumi.

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Yakumo Koizumi, you mean the author of "Kwaidan"?

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Yes, most people are familiar with "Mimi nashi Yoichi" (Earless Yoichi)

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,700
and "Yuki Onna" (Snow Woman).

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,700
And there's a spooky story based in Matsue City.

38
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,400
Do you want to hear it, Ran?

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,300
-Well, maybe another time. -You're scared.

40
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
"Matsue Lake Hotel"

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,200
One of our staff will show you to your room,

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
please wait over there for a while.

44
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,700
We serve all our guest green tea and sweets.

45
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,200
Oh, thanks.

46
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
It's the lake!

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,500
How wonderful, they have such a great view of the lake from here.

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,800
We'll be able to see them digging for clams tomorrow morning.

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
Speaking of clam digging,

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,100
I believe Basho composed a poem about it.

51
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,400
Parting at Futami, dividing like Shijimi,

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
we go along with the autumn.

53
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,100
Or something like that.

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
Mr. Shiina, that's rude.

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,700
But, Ms. Reiko...

56
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,200
I hate to correct you.

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,500
But I believe it was clam and shells, not Shijimi.

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,600
Clam and shells?

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Yes. Actually, the poem reads,

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Parting at Futami, dividing like clam and shells,

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
we go along with the autumn.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
In this connection, there's a lot of shops at Hasamichi

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
are called "Ogaki".

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,300
You do know your literature.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
Matsue ranks high alongside Kyoto and Kanazawa

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
for its Japanese sweets.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Our hometown Osaka got to work harder at it.

68
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,600
He's Takumi Yagisawa.

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,700
He runs a Japanese confectionery shop in Osaka.

70
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,100
"Takumi Yagisawa (32)" -Oh, it's no big deal.

71
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,400
I just took over the business from my father.

72
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,200
So, you're a young master.

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,300
They sure look good.

74
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
I'm helping myself!

75
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,400
Me, too.

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,300
But don't forget...

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,500
to brush your teeth after you eat them.

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes, of course...

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,900
He's Ryosuke Shiina.

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
"Ryosuke Shiina (38)" -A superb dentist.

81
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,500
Nice to meet you.

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,100
And over there is...

83
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
"Mizuki Kawaguchi (27)" -Mizuki Kawaguchi

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,200
one of my students, she also works in the library.

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,300
Hello.

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,900
Did you say student? Then, you must be...

87
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
Forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself.

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,700
"Reiko Ando (43)" -My name is Reiko Ando.

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
I do research at a junior college

90
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
in Osaka in the Japanese Literature Department.

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,700
For goodness sakes, you're an expert!

92
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,200
We're members of a linked verses group from Osaka,

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,300
we came to Matsue on a poetry composing trip.

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,100
You don t say...

95
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,200
Our other member is over there talking.

96
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,100
That's Gozo Ushikubo, he's an investor.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,500
"Gozo Ushikubo (51)" -Which means the price of this stock...

98
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,000
will keep rising.

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,800
My name is Kogoro Mouri,

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm a private investigator from Tokyo.

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,300
Kogoro Mouri?

102
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,400
Kogoro Mouri, you mean you're that...

103
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Famous private detective?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Oh, yes.

105
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100
Does that mean

106
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,800
that famous private detectives make a lot of money?

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, not exactly.

108
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,200
Anyway, you...

109
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,700
Excuse me, my name is Tomonaga.

110
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,600
I work for Naniwa Securities at their Okayama branch.

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,300
Previously on another job, Mr. Ushikubo and...

112
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,600
Hey, you.

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,700
Isn't it time for you to leave?

114
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,400
You're right.

115
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,100
I enjoy poetry and I sometimes compose my own poetry.

116
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,500
I'd like to join you one day.

117
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,200
Mr. Mouri, I hope you have a nice visit.

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,900
Excuse me, Ms. Reiko, what is that big book?

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, you mean this?

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,900
This is called "Dictionary of What Things are Called".

121
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,200
We use it when we're composing poetry.

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Would you like to look through it?

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,900
Yes!

124
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,300
It looks very interesting.

125
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Hey, look at these shoes!

126
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,100
See, they look just like Mr. Shiina's shoes.

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
They're trekking shoes.

128
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,750
But then, those are for professionals,

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,950
while mine's are just an imitation.

130
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,150
Those shoes of yours are so fancy, they look pretty expensive.

131
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,250
Even though you're broke.

132
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,850
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

133
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,050
why don't you join us for dinner?

134
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,350
That's a great idea!

135
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,050
We'll get to hear stories from Japan's greatest detective,

136
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,050
what a rare opportunity!

137
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,050
Japan's greatest?

138
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,450
I'll accept your invitation, then.

139
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,350
Don't you just love these hot springs?

140
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,450
Yes.

141
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,950
Me, too.

142
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,650
It feels so good,

143
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,350
my body feels like it's turning into melted chocolate.

144
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,550
Exactly.

145
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,250
Excuse me, Mr. Yagisawa.

146
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,250
Yes?

147
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,950
What is that linked verses you were talking about back there?

148
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,650
How can I explain...

149
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,750
Simply put,

150
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,450
it's a kind of game where several people compose poems

151
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,750
and link them together.

152
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,450
For example, Conan, you compose a 5-7-5 haiku.

153
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,950
The next person would add another 7-7 poem to it.

154
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,550
Then another person would add another 5-7-5 poem to it.

155
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,050
And so forth, linking one poem to the other.

156
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,550
Is it different from haiku?

157
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,750
The first 5-7-5 is called hokku.

158
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,350
I suppose you could consider it haiku.

159
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,150
After all, It would contain the season word.

160
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,450
I see.

161
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,750
What kind of poem do you like, Mr. Yagisawa?

162
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,450
I like poems that are humorous.

163
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,450
What about you, Mr. Shiina?

164
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,950
Huh? Me?

165
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,350
Let's see...

166
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,450
My favorite poems are those with feelings,

167
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,350
like how a father feels for his daughter.

168
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,950
Pardon me for asking but do you have children, Mr. Shiina?

169
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,850
I have a daughter,

170
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,250
but my wife took her when she left me.

171
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,650
Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.

172
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,050
I don't blame her though, it was all my fault.

173
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,950
I was over my head in debt.

174
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,550
Thank you for listening.

175
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,450
That was wonderful, Mr. Yagisawa!

176
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,350
Here you go Mr. Mouri, drink up.

177
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,150
Well, that's nice of you.

178
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,950
By the way, have you made plans for tomorrow?

179
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,450
Oh, that's right.

180
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,150
I was meaning to ask.

181
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,850
Conan, have you ever heard of Yaegaki Shrine?

182
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,750
Ms. Reiko told me about it while we were in the bath,

183
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,950
why don't we go there tomorrow?

184
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,550
We're going to the Tiffany Garden Museum of Art tomorrow morning.

185
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,950
Then in the afternoon...

186
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,050
Yaegaki Shrine...

187
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,050
I believe it houses the God of marriage.

188
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,650
It's famous for it's Mirror Lake fortune telling, right?

189
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,950
Yes.

190
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,350
Well then, we'll have to go there.

191
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,350
All of four of us except Mr. Ushikubo are all single.

192
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,850
But Ran already has someone special.

193
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,350
Isn't that right?

194
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm sure there's a bus that goes to Yaegaki Shrine

195
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,250
from the Matsue Onsen station in the morning.

196
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,550
You can go to the art museum in the afternoon.

197
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,550
All right, then. That's what we'll do.

198
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,150
Good grief. Look at those two, acting like you're in love.

199
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,450
Now, now.

200
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,350
Ms. Reiko, listen.

201
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,450
Yes?

202
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,050
Don't you think it's about time we picked the location

203
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,750
where we're going to compose our first poem?

204
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,150
You're right.

205
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,150
On that note, Mr. Shiina.

206
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,350
Yes.

207
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,050
The first place for the poem composition?

208
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,750
We're going to pick

209
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,350
where we're to go to compose the hokku portion of the poem.

210
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,350
I remember hokku is the 5-7-5 haiku that starts the linked poem.

211
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,350
Yes, the rule is to compose the poem

212
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,250
by describing the scene in front of you.

213
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,650
Oh, I nearly forgot.

214
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,350
This is for you, Mr. Mouri.

215
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,550
It's an introduction to linked poetry that I wrote.

216
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,350
There's a picture of us inside, too.

217
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,950
I see, you're all here.

218
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,850
There, I'm finished.

219
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,150
Mizuki, can you get me my hat over there?

220
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,450
Okay.

221
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,850
Here you are.

222
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,250
Thank you.

223
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,250
All right. Mr. Ushikubo, you first.

224
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,450
Okay.

225
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,150
Since we're taking turns according to age,

226
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,150
so the next one is me.

227
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,050
Let's see...

228
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,750
The closest one is...

229
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,050
Which one is it?

230
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,350
All right, please open it.

231
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,950
Matsue Castle.

232
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,650
Mine is Gessho Temple.

233
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,750
Shiominawate.

234
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,150
Which means...

235
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,550
I'm at the art museum.

236
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,100
All right, then. We'll leave the hotel at 9 tomorrow morning.

237
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,550
And return by 11:30.

238
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,050
When everyone gets back, we'll move to Tamatsukuri Spa

239
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,750
and link the poems...

240
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,950
Is something the matter?

241
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,150
No, it's just that I wear contact lenses

242
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,950
and my eyes dry very easily.

243
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,150
So I always need my prescription eye drops.

244
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,450
Oh, here they are.

245
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,250
I'm such a scatter brain,

246
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,750
I forget where I leave it all the time.

247
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,350
If it's so important,

248
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,050
you should always carry a spare!

249
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,850
I always carry an extra one in my bag...

250
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,050
Oh, that's right. I have to make a phone call!

251
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,950
Isn't he a busy fellow?

252
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,650
He's probably just found another victim.

253
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,550
His motive for joining our group

254
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,750
was partially to get our money.

255
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,150
He's really a louse!

256
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,050
Listen up, Yagisawa!

257
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,450
You're the one who can't afford to lose your business!

258
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,850
That...

259
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,650
Get it all ready by next week

260
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,350
or else you'll lose your business, understand?

261
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,750
Yes, I know.

262
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,760
"Yaegaki Shrine"

263
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,260
It says that if the paper doesn't sink within fifteen minutes,

264
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,210
"Mirror Lake"
It says that if the paper doesn't sink within fifteen minutes,

265
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,860
you'll find the love of your life.
"Mirror Lake"

266
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,110
you'll find the love of your life.

267
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,510
And if it sinks close to you,

268
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,710
it means that the person you're looking for is close by.

269
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,710
Let's try it.

270
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,210
That's why I didn't want to bring her here.

271
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,010
Ran.

272
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,810
I don't know how it's going to turn out,

273
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,010
but...

274
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,910
Sorry to keep you waiting, Conan!

275
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,210
What a cute puppy.

276
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,110
Ran.

277
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,210
Shall we go?

278
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,510
Hello.

279
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,410
Oh, dad.

280
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,610
What?

281
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,010
What? Mr. Ushikubo's dead?

282
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,310
What?

283
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,910
"Karamete Park"

284
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,410
It's Mr. Ushikubo.

285
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,010
I'm certain of it.

286
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,710
I see, so it is.

287
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,410
By the looks of it, he's been beaten to death.

288
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,410
He was hit on the back of the head several times

289
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,010
with a hard, blunt object.

290
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,010
"Officer Hirose"

291
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,610
Are you by any chance...

292
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,610
My name's Mouri, I'm a private detective.

293
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,110
It looks like Mr. Ushikubo tried to protect his head

294
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,010
with his left hand when he was attacked.

295
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,010
That's how his watch was cracked.

296
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,310
10:05 am.

297
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,710
I'm pretty sure we can assume that's the time of the attack.

298
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,710
Yes. And about the victim's right hand...

299
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,710
His index finger is extended Iike he was pointing to something.

300
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,210
Bamboo...

301
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,810
It could be a dying message.

302
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,410
There's blood on the tip of his finger.

303
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,310
And it looks like he touched something with it.

304
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,210
There's no blood here.

305
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,010
One of the pages has been ripped out!

306
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,610
"Autumn surges, there's no sorrow in my life."

307
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,110
-You little... -That hurts!

308
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,610
Don't touch the evidence!

309
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,010
"Matsue Police Station"

310
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,710
Sorry to keep you waiting.

311
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,810
"Officer Yasugi" -I'm Yasugi from Shimane Prefectural Police.

312
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,010
"Officer Tsubaki" -And this is my assistant, Officer Tsubaki.

313
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,810
-Hey, where's that kid? -And beside him is Officer Hirose...

314
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,910
of the Matsue Police Station.

315
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,010
Well, he was asking everybody questions

316
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,510
and then he ran off somewhere.

317
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,310
Good grief.

318
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,510
The reason I asked all of you to come here

319
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,510
is I need to know where you were when Mr. Ushikubo was killed,

320
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,410
which is approximately 10:05.

321
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,510
What are you insinuating?

322
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,710
From what Mr. Mouri tells me,

323
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,210
you all had a motive for killing Mr. Ushikubo.

324
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,110
Everything's bound to come out sooner or later,

325
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,510
so I think it's better for everyone to just tell the truth.

326
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:49,210
I was at the Tiffany Garden Museum of Art.

327
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,510
I went there to write a poem.

328
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,410
"Tiffany Garden Museum of Art" -There's a piece called Deer's Window.

329
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,210
I wrote a poem while I was looking at it.

330
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,010
Even Gods will gather and gaze upon Deer's Window.

331
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,910
Yes, I do remember him.

332
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,210
He dropped some coins and leaned over the pond

333
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,510
near the fountain in the English Garden over there.

334
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,210
Do you remember the time?

335
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,910
I'm sure it was a little past 11.

336
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,210
Thank you!

337
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,810
What are these marks?

338
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,610
I was at Gessho Temple at that time.

339
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,510
You probably know there's huge statue of a turtle there, right?

340
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,510
Yes.

341
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,710
"Gessho Temple" -I spotted a praying mantis by that statue.

342
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,010
To the huge turtle, a mantis does raise its ax in reverence forsooth,

343
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,610
is what I wrote.

344
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,710
The time was almost 10:05 am.

345
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,910
Yes, I remember.

346
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,610
He stood in front of that statue for a long time thinking.

347
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,510
Do you remember what time it was?

348
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,510
I'm sure it was 11:00 am.

349
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,210
11:00 am.

350
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,310
I was looking at the samurai residences at Shiominawate.

351
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,910
I was there from about 10 am until 11 am.

352
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,010
"Samurai residences at Shiominawate" -I don't have any witnesses,

353
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,510
but I sat in the rest area thinking up a poem.

354
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,310
And did you come up with something?

355
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,610
Yes.

356
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,610
Soft and gently where the sun shines upon

357
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,110
the dancing autumn leaves.

358
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,410
This is it.

359
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,610
Huh?

360
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,110
From the rest area,

361
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,610
these plants would hide the autumn leaves from view.

362
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,510
I went for a stroll along the lake

363
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,110
and then went to the Prefectural Art Museum.

364
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,810
But I didn't write a poem.

365
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,110
Why not?

366
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,310
Because on this outing,

367
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,410
I had each of them write a poem

368
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,010
I was going to select which one to use

369
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,810
for the start of the linked poem.

370
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,010
No one remembers seeing Ms. Reiko.

371
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,610
That's right, that memo pad...

372
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,810
There was stock information written in it.

373
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,210
The page that was torn out,

374
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,610
something must've been written on it

375
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,610
while that person was talking to that person.

376
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,310
"Hisatoshi Tomonaga" -Yes, Mr. Ushikubo seemed quite happy.

377
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,310
He jotted it down in his notebook.

378
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,810
I see, thank you very much!

379
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,810
All right. Now, I have all the information!

380
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,310
It seems like none of you has a solid alibi.

381
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,910
By the way, have you found the murder weapon?

382
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,410
We're still searching the area.

383
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,610
And we'll also search the places you all went to,

384
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,010
so please don't leave Matsue until I say you can.

385
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,510
All right.

386
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,010
I'd like to continue our linked poem session

387
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,710
as a tribute to the late Mr. Ushikubo.

388
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,210
That's a good idea. Let's do it.

389
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,810
The linked poetry session...

390
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,810
What? You want me to join their group?

391
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,410
Yes! You're sharp,

392
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,710
So you'd be able to figure out who the killer is

393
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,810
just by watching them.

394
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,710
Well, sure. But...

395
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,210
That's a great idea!

396
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,910
Please do it!

397
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,010
I'm absolutely positive one of those four killed him

398
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,510
and we're going to find out at that poetry session!

399
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,080
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,920
"Hokku"
