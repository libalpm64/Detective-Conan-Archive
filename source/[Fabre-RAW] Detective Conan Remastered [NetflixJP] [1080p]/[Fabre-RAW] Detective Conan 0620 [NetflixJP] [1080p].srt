1
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,691
Let!

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,691
First service.

3
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,591
The net again.

4
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:22,291
Hey, hey. Wasn't Minerva Grass' serves said to be accurate?

5
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:26,691
Yeah. She rarely shoots a double fault either.

6
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,191
I wonder why she's shooting the ball at the net.

7
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:33,691
Let!

8
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:35,191
First service.

9
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,691
All she's doing is touching the net.

10
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:42,491
Yep. I wonder if she's not in very good condition.

11
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:45,291
No, her form's how it should be,

12
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,027
so she should be shooting where she's aiming.

13
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,029
Then, why?

14
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,491
What's the matter, Minerva?

15
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:52,791
Just what are you doing?

16
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,039
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,491
You must be true to yourself.

18
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:04,391
The message from the Grass Court Queen,

19
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,591
will it reach the apprentice of Holmes?

20
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,047
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,049
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,491
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:57,282
An eerie coded message awaits us when we arrive in London.

24
00:02:57,282 --> 00:03:00,159
It was a forewarning of murder

25
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,982
from the vicious criminal on the run, Hades Sabara.

26
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:06,165
We deciphered the code and figured out

27
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:07,282
that the crime was going to be committed

28
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,182
at the Wimbledon Center Court.

29
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:15,782
On Baker Street, Ran happened to run into

30
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:18,482
and get acquainted to a world famous number 1 ranking tennis player

31
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:20,179
named Minerva Grass,

32
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,482
who plays in the finals of the ladies' single competition.

33
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,187
Although we rushed over to the Wimbledon,

34
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,782
we couldn't get into the Center Court

35
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:32,482
because we didn't have tickets.

36
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:35,282
Darn it! You mean there's nothing we can do

37
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,082
but suck our finger and watch?

38
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:45,282
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Grass Court Queen)"

39
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:58,217
Minerva lost the 1st set 0-6!

40
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,882
Of course.

41
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:03,382
I mean she kept grazing the net, 2 or 3 times

42
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,582
followed by soft serves.

43
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:07,782
Maybe something's wrong with her serve

44
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,682
that she is only able to make slice serves.

45
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,582
But it's strange.

46
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,682
It's still first service,

47
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,882
so she could've switched to hard serve

48
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,482
until she hits too hard and gets a fault.

49
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:22,241
But not only has she not double faulted,

50
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,882
she hasn't even faulted a single time, why?

51
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:26,982
It's on the screen!

52
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,249
The spots where Minerva's serves have landed in this match!

53
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,682
It seems that the positions

54
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:33,382
where her serves grazed the net are also indicated.

55
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:34,682
They're neatly spaced

56
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:37,882
as if she calculated where each serve would land.

57
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:41,482
Don't tell me that this is...

58
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:45,382
Is there anything different about Minerva than her usual self?

59
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,282
Something different...

60
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,482
You mean like something is wrong with her serves?

61
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:52,582
No, like if she's doing something she usually doesn't do,

62
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,182
or something she usually does, but isn't doing today.

63
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,682
Come to think of it,

64
00:04:58,682 --> 00:04:59,982
it looks like she's not wearing her wristband

65
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,682
on her right hand today.

66
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:02,982
She said in an interview

67
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:06,582
that she makes it a point to wear the wristband

68
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:08,582
that was given to her by her father during all of her finals.

69
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:10,782
I wonder if she forgot it today?

70
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,782
Wristband...

71
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,482
Unbelievable!

72
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:28,682
It's the 2nd set,

73
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:30,782
and Grass hasn't won a single game yet!

74
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:33,282
That unrivaled Grass Court Queen, Minerva Grass,

75
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,882
what on earth has happened to her?

76
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,319
Oh my...

77
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,719
I guess we're going to have a disappointing get together tonight.

78
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,819
Yep.

79
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:51,319
How sad, a fan even gave her a cute stuffed doll too, and yet...

80
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,519
I guess I won't be able to give it to her.

81
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,341
It's mail from Holmes' apprentice.

82
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,119
Meet me at Murray Mound?

83
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:09,919
What? The culprit is after big sis?

84
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,219
Are you serious?

85
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,353
Yeah. She probably found out about it,

86
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,319
and is trying to tell us about it with her serves!

87
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,819
But, how did she find out?

88
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,019
Maybe the culprit told her?

89
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,519
By sticking a letter or something on the inside of her wristband.

90
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,365
It wouldn't be possible to do anything

91
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,367
with the racket that she always uses,

92
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,019
but it's the wristband that she only uses during the finals,

93
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:32,919
it wouldn't be difficult for the culprit to stick something in.

94
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,373
Come to think of it,

95
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,719
sis lost her bag at the hotel the other day,

96
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,919
but we found it right away

97
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,379
and she checked the contents of the bag after finding it too!

98
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,919
Then, it was probably put there, back then!

99
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,119
She probably didn't check inside the wristband at that time.

100
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,019
I'll go tell everybody about it, then!

101
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,389
No!

102
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,619
Huh?

103
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,819
I have no idea how the culprit is planning to kill your sister.

104
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,819
But he's heinous enough to bomb the hospital

105
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,419
even after the code was deciphered!

106
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,519
If we make the wrong move and cause a fuss,

107
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,619
canceling the match and all,

108
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:07,319
he may kill your sister at that instant!

109
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,919
Then, just what are we supposed to do?

110
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,919
Are you telling me to just do nothing and watch?

111
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,619
I'm not just going to do nothing.

112
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:17,219
So, won't you give me your ticket?

113
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,619
I'll go into the Center Court in your place,

114
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,719
find the culprit and protect your sister no matter what it takes!

115
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:24,819
What? You're going, Conan?

116
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,019
Wouldn't it be better if I go?

117
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,819
Not you, Pops!

118
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,429
Because the culprit may know

119
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:34,433
that you're a famous detective from Japan.

120
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,819
I may be able to catch the culprit off guard since I'm a child!

121
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:42,219
Okay, I'll give you my ticket.

122
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:46,219
But if I don't go back, mother and Ales may worry.

123
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,447
It'll be okay if you mail Ales and tell him

124
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,219
that you'll wait outside

125
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,719
because you don't want to watch Minerva lose!

126
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,419
But, how on earth do you expect to find the culprit inside?

127
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,919
After all, it seems like the culprit, Hades

128
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,819
has been changing his face repeatedly!

129
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:04,463
I mean as to that, I'll just do what you always do, Pops!

130
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,219
It's the spirit that counts, the spirit!

131
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,919
Sp... Spirit.

132
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,919
Conan!

133
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,419
You don't have to go out of your way to nab the culprit,

134
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,919
but make sure that you protect Minerva no matter what it takes!

135
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,419
Because I have something that I have to tell her!

136
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,319
Okay, I got it!

137
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,419
Shout... scream... make more noise!

138
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,519
The more noise you make,

139
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,819
the more impact there'll be of the fearful silence that will follow.

140
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,501
A little longer...

141
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,619
Soon, mother...

142
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:49,719
Let!

143
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,519
First service.

144
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,819
Just as I thought.

145
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:56,919
The thing that she's etching on the court is...

146
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,119
Braille!

147
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,919
She's trying to make Braille letters

148
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,219
by dropping her serves at the appropriate locations

149
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,219
so that the culprit won't notice.

150
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,719
The Braille that she learned for her mother

151
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,819
whose vision is disabled.

152
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,319
A Braille cell expresses a letter by etching dots

153
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,533
in the six positions arranged in a 2 X 3 rectangle.

154
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,219
She hit the net repeatedly with her serves

155
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:18,919
because in order to etch on the bottom row,

156
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,019
she needs to let the ball graze the net

157
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,219
or the ball won't drop where it should.

158
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:23,319
And depending on the letter,

159
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,119
she will need to hit a lot of serves to position

160
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,819
as many as five dots in the correct position.

161
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:32,551
If so, the first serve as viewed from her side

162
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,819
would be "H".

163
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,819
Next, "E".

164
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:38,119
Next, "L".

165
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,559
The fourth, "P".

166
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,561
Connected...

167
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,319
The word "Help" is spelled!

168
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:51,019
She was seeking someone who could read this to help her.

169
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,019
Let!

170
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,019
First service.

171
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,419
Until her service game is up,

172
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,619
she's repeatedly hitting the ball to spell out "Help"

173
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:01,419
until her service time is over.

174
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,919
Now, what I want to know is

175
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,587
what message did Hades relay to her.

176
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,619
Just as I thought,

177
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:16,619
there was a paper stuck inside her wristband,

178
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:20,919
but I can't see at all what's written.

179
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,219
Darn it!

180
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:25,719
I'd like to relay to her in some way that I'm on her side.

181
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,519
But how can I relay it to her

182
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,419
without causing a commotion during the match?

183
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:32,219
Come on, Minerva!

184
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:33,619
Come on!

185
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:39,019
Come on, Minerva...

186
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,619
Thank you.

187
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,519
Yes.

188
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,629
If you really exist in this world,

189
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,419
you would appear gallantly and help me.

190
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,419
But of course, you're nothing more than a character on paper.

191
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:00,639
There's no way that someone like you would exist in this world.

192
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,419
Yes, a person like Sherlock Holmes...

193
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:08,647
Minerva!

194
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,649
I'll help you!

195
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,319
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

196
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:19,319
Holmes' apprentice?

197
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:21,119
Conan!

198
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,661
That idiot!

199
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
What on earth is he doing?

200
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,671
What a laugh that such a brat is Holmes' apprentice.

201
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,319
He's wearing glasses and short,

202
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,219
but really sharp and brainy apprentice of Holmes!

203
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,819
He says he's going to help me...

204
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,683
Does that mean he was able to read my message?

205
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,919
Oh, you can help me? When you're so small?

206
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,619
Of course.

207
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,619
Thank you.

208
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,319
Then, I'm counting on you.

209
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,319
Apprentice of Holmes'.

210
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,524
Thank you.

211
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:36,224
The last letter are made of four dots.

212
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,024
She shot three times so what remains

213
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,824
is the one beyond in the right corner.

214
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:44,743
That's the only place left.

215
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:52,024
Out!

216
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:54,324
15-40.

217
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:58,424
Minerva scored a point!

218
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:03,224
But I wonder what happened to her opponent, Baur?

219
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,424
Yeah.

220
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:07,424
I guess she was taken aback when Minerva shot back.

221
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,924
It was a slice serve and yet...

222
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,771
It's no wonder that she's taken aback.

223
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,324
The Braille Minerva's forming now is not the

224
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:19,624
H, E, L or P that she was repeatedly hitting till now.

225
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,781
It's a "G".

226
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:26,424
Since she's starting to form letters that she didn't form before,

227
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:29,224
it's most likely that what she's going to start doing from now is

228
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,524
to let us know what the message that she received was.

229
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,793
Holmes' apprentice...

230
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,797
If I'm not mistaken, Apollo told me you're a boy from Japan.

231
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,424
If you call yourself the apprentice

232
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,124
of the famous detective that I adore and respect...

233
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,724
Read it like it should be read, okay?

234
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,805
The next letter is,

235
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,124
the only one out of all the 26 letters of the alphabet...

236
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:55,324
that can be etched

237
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:57,224
by one dot in Braille!

238
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:07,524
Yes!

239
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,224
Service A!

240
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,824
She made it land to the upper left,

241
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:14,324
so this is literally the Braille for "A".

242
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:17,624
Connecting it with the previous one, we have "G" and "A".

243
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,837
So, what's next?

244
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,843
She's changing her serve patterns.

245
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,624
I see. She's finally getting serious.

246
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:36,324
Fault!

247
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:38,857
She missed her serve for the first time.

248
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:40,859
And really off too.

249
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,124
Which means that, this is probably where the letter cuts off.

250
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:54,324
"G" is followed by A, M, E.

251
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:56,875
So the first word is "Game"!

252
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:03,824
Let!

253
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:05,324
Second service.

254
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:08,224
She's got amazing concentration.

255
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,893
She accurately changed the angle of her serves that hit the net

256
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,524
in order to place each ball in the correct six spots

257
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,897
to represent letters in Braille.

258
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,224
Just as would be expected of the Grass Court Queen.

259
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,324
She can place her serves wherever she wants.

260
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,905
Deuce!

261
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,924
And Minerva had the advantage.

262
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:34,924
Deuce again.

263
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:37,424
This is her sixth time.

264
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,924
She's doing it deliberately.

265
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,224
She's playing deuces on purpose

266
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:41,724
in order to extend the game

267
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,824
and form more Braille letters.

268
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:49,524
The words she formed till now are...

269
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:53,524
Game, Set, Death, M.

270
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,937
When the game ends, M will die?

271
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:03,624
Advantage, Ms. Grass!

272
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:06,024
The Braille just now is an "O".

273
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,224
After "Death" the letters "M" and "O" follow, which means...

274
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:12,624
No...

275
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:18,524
The game goes to Ms. Grass!

276
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:22,124
The score now is 3-1, with Baur in the lead.

277
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:25,324
If the game ends, the message ends here too.

278
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:28,024
And the Braille that she just shot was "M".

279
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:30,324
Put together, it spells "Mom".

280
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,024
Mother.

281
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:36,024
The one that Hades is after is not Minerva.

282
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:39,324
But, rather her mother.

283
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,524
Come to think of it, Ran said...

284
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:48,224
that Minerva lost at last year's French Open,

285
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,424
which was the only time her mother couldn't come to support her.

286
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,624
If Hades had placed a large debt on Minerva's win

287
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,124
at that championship game...

288
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:57,424
If he were to wrongfully have held a grudge against her mother

289
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,124
thinking that the defeat was due to her mother not coming...

290
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,224
It makes sense that he would direct his murderous intent

291
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:03,824
towards her mother.

292
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,724
But how is he planning to kill her?

293
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:09,824
Is he nearby?

294
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:15,013
She received a large stuffed doll for big sis from somebody!

295
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:16,524
It couldn't be...

296
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:19,017
That stuffed doll that her mother is carrying...

297
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:22,224
That's right.

298
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:26,224
Hold it tight and don't let go.

299
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:29,624
Because it's the fireworks that will help me celebrate

300
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:31,824
the end of my revenge.

301
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,324
What? A bomb?

302
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,824
What?

303
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:42,224
What was that?

304
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:45,043
Is there a bomb inside that stuffed doll?

305
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,024
Yeah.

306
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,724
Hades is probably planning to kill your mother

307
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:51,624
by blowing it up when the game ends!

308
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:55,053
I'll call mom and tell her to pretend she's going to the ladies room,

309
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,424
and to get out of her seat!

310
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:59,057
No! If you make any suspicious moves,

311
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,324
he may think that we figured everything out,

312
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:03,924
and push a remote control switch to set off the bomb!

313
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:06,724
Your mother may be spared,

314
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:10,424
but the crowd of people in the surroundings may get involved.

315
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,071
It'll be one of the worst disasters since the start of Wimbledon!

316
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,073
No...

317
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,424
So, there's no other way than to find Hades

318
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:19,624
who is among the people here in the Center Court

319
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:21,624
and capturing him!

320
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:25,083
But, can you find him?

321
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:30,124
Your mother and Ales weren't in the family box,

322
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:31,624
but do they always sit in that general admission seat there?

323
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,424
Yep. Mom said in a magazine interview

324
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,024
that she doesn't like to be taken by the TV cameras

325
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:41,624
so she prefers to sit in the general seat under the shade.

326
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:43,101
In the shade?

327
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:45,924
If so, Hades may be on the other side

328
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,624
where the sun is shining, then.

329
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,107
Huh? Why?

330
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,524
The video!

331
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:53,124
He video tapes the moments of his crimes each time,

332
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,524
and sends them to the police.

333
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:58,324
If he read that magazine interview,

334
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:01,124
it is most likely that he would be sitting right opposite of her,

335
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:03,724
so that he can have a good shot of the moment of the blast!

336
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:06,524
If so, if we look for a guy with a video camera

337
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:08,724
sitting on that side of the bleachers...

338
00:19:08,724 --> 00:19:11,124
No, there are a lot of them.

339
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:13,124
We've got to narrow it down to one person.

340
00:19:13,124 --> 00:19:15,524
Then... Then, how?

341
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,624
Right. How do we find him?

342
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,324
Just how, from among the 15,000 spectators here!

343
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,724
Hey, what's with this cheering?

344
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:29,147
The spectators are coming out to the corridor!

345
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,524
Don't tell me that the game ended?

346
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:32,824
Not yet.

347
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,153
The match just entered the tie-break

348
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:38,424
because sis tied, 6-all!

349
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:40,924
The spectators are probably making a fuss

350
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,624
because of the rain.

351
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:44,524
They're suspending the game by 30 minutes,

352
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:46,224
and the spectators are noisy

353
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:48,724
because the roof of the Center Court is closing.

354
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,169
Then, isn't your mother going to leave her seat

355
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,824
until the roof closes?

356
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,824
She won't. She has an umbrella besides.

357
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:58,324
Mother... When she lost her vision

358
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:02,024
and couldn't make it to the French Open and sis lost...

359
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,724
She really regretted what happened.

360
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:04,924
And since then, she always says that

361
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:07,624
she will never leave her seat until the match ends.

362
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:14,624
When the roof closes,

363
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:15,624
the cheers echo throughout this place,

364
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:18,024
-and it kind of feels strange. -Yes.

365
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:22,624
But I wonder what happened to Apollo?

366
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:25,624
When Minerva is competing in such a great match.

367
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,205
True.

368
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:32,124
I'll explain the details later,

369
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:34,124
so don't move from your seat!

370
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:35,824
Apollo.

371
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:37,215
What on earth is going on?

372
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:40,824
Oh, no!

373
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,824
The spectators who evacuated to the corridors

374
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,024
are beginning to go back inside.

375
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,424
The game's going to resume.

376
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:50,424
If Minerva loses this tie break, the game ends.

377
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:53,724
Hades will push the switch for the bomb!

378
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:57,235
I've got to find him somehow by then,

379
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,924
but I don't even know what he looks like.

380
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:02,024
How do I look for him?

381
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:08,024
Apollo! Did you text mail Ales like I told you to?

382
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:12,524
Yep. And this may not be relevant,

383
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:15,253
but I've heard about how sis finds the seat

384
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,024
that mom is sitting in during her matches.

385
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:20,024
I always wondered how,

386
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,524
although sis was never told where mom would be sitting,

387
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,524
she always managed to call out to mother

388
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:25,263
after she won a match.

389
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,924
And? How does she do it?

390
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:31,269
She said she lobs the ball really high during the match.

391
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,724
Too high, I should add.

392
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:37,724
She never told me how she found mom, though.

393
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:40,424
She lobs the ball really high, too high...

394
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:49,824
The Queen appears again.

395
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:52,524
Struggle along as much as you can

396
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,224
to prolong every second your mother

397
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:56,824
gets to live as much as possible.

398
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:04,824
If I lose this tie break,

399
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,624
mother will...

400
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,624
Come on, Minerva!

401
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:14,724
Don't give up the fight!

402
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:18,124
Even though she has a championship point!

403
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:20,924
Hang in there, win the match!

404
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,824
Hang in?

405
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,224
Grass Court Queen.

406
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:28,124
Can you do it?

407
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:31,924
Okay!

408
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:37,624
Now, our game is on.

409
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,124
Hades!

410
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,004
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:05,720
"The lady wearing sunglasses"

412
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,560
It's finally the last episode of the London edition!

413
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
I don't want to go home yet!
