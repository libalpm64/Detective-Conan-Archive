1
-1:59:18,576 --> -1:59:23,476
-Happy new year, everyone! -Happy new year, everyone!

2
-1:59:23,476 --> -1:59:26,876
Detective Conan has entered its 15th year.

3
-1:59:26,876 --> -1:59:31,676
We will continue to solve one case after another this year too,

4
-1:59:31,676 --> -1:59:34,776
so please stay with us and tune in as you always have!

5
-1:59:40,776 --> -1:59:42,176
Dad?

6
-1:59:42,176 --> -1:59:45,376
No way, I haven't done anything.

7
-1:59:45,376 --> -1:59:48,476
Dad, nothing's happened yet, you know?

8
-1:59:55,976 --> -1:59:59,476
I guess he's just wasted from all the drinks he had.

9
-1:59:59,476 --> 00:00:00,976
I guess you're right.

10
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:04,676
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

11
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:07,276
Tears are the start of all dramas.

12
00:00:07,276 --> 00:00:08,976
The mystery that lurks in the tennis court.

13
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,376
A sharp deduction is a smash that scores a point.

14
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:12,976
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,976
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:17,376
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,269
"The Devil that Lurks in the Tennis Court"

18
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,469
Sonoko's tennis coach,

19
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,869
Mr. Takao Goto will be competing in a tennis match,

20
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,669
"Karuizawa Highland Resort Park" -so we decided to accompany her

21
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,269
to North Karuizawa.

22
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,969
Ran, here it goes!

23
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,969
Hey, are you sure it's okay?

24
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,569
Yep, it's okay.

25
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,169
Today's the practice match for the tournament coming up,

26
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,669
so as long as we clean up before it starts!

27
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,369
There!

28
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,969
What was that?

29
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,769
"Takao Goto, Yuka Tsuchida" -Why did you bring the daughter

30
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,469
of the Suzuki Financial Group here?

31
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,769
She just came here to root for me.

32
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,069
I'll bet you're want to make her your girl from now on!

33
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,769
Don't be silly.

34
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,669
What do you think I'm interested in a slip girl like her?

35
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,869
I'm pampering her a bit only

36
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:02,469
because she's the daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group.

37
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,169
I wonder about that...

38
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,569
It's true.

39
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:09,369
You're the only one in my eyes, Yuka.

40
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:19,569
However, the bigger the fish, the better it is.

41
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:29,469
If you ever betray me,

42
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,469
I'll never forgive you.

43
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,269
I wonder where Conan went.

44
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,369
Weren't you with Sonoko a while ago?

45
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,669
Yes, I'm Ran Mouri.

46
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,069
"Fumihiro Azuma (22)" -If it's that little boy,

47
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,169
he went to the restroom a while ago.

48
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,369
Would you like me to go look?

49
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,669
No, thank you. I'll go...

50
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:52,469
Let me. After all, it's the men's room.

51
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,169
Sorry for the trouble.

52
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,869
This place really is spacious.

53
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,069
That's the guy I saw a while ago.

54
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,169
I'd like to talk to you about the money I lent you.

55
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,369
That...

56
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,369
Please wait a while more.

57
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:21,269
"Chie Ootake (19)" -If you don't give it back to me,

58
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,269
I'll be in trouble.

59
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,569
What the...

60
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,869
The fact that I get to enter this tournament,

61
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,969
thanks to you too, you know, Chie.

62
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,269
I...

63
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,769
See you then, because I've got a match.

64
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,169
No good!

65
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,869
What a nuisance, that broad.

66
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,369
Why can't she just shut up and keep supporting me financially?

67
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,169
Quite a player...

68
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,069
If he doesn't pay me back,

69
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,069
what am I going to do?

70
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,969
Boy,

71
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,869
Ran and the others were worried about you.

72
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:06,969
Yes.

73
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:21,169
-Great! -Mr. Goto!

74
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,269
What the heck?

75
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,769
I thought they were on bad terms just a while ago.

76
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,669
Girls are so incomprehensible.

77
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:35,369
-Mr. Goto! -Coach!

78
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,669
Game. Goto!

79
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,769
-Mr. Goto, you're fantastic. -Coach, you're awesome!

80
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,469
Here, the usual honey lemon water!

81
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:47,769
Just what I wanted.

82
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:49,169
Thank you.

83
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,869
As I thought, Yuka know me the best.

84
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,569
Mr. Goto, please use this.

85
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:01,403
Thank you, Chie.

86
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,503
Coach Goto, keep up the good work!

87
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,803
Thank you, Sonoko.

88
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,203
It's surprising you knew what color I like.

89
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,303
Well, it's because your racket is always that color, coach.

90
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:15,303
Nice play.

91
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:16,703
Give it your best shot!

92
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:20,503
I won't goof things up like you did, Azuma.

93
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:22,903
Captain Azuma, you're really a push-over, aren't you?

94
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:24,303
If only he didn't hurt himself,

95
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:28,303
his place in the tournament wouldn't have been taken by Mr. Goto.

96
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:30,403
Hey, you know what?

97
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,303
You're no match for me,

98
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:34,503
so why don't we change this into a mix double match?

99
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:37,603
I'll pair with a girl that doesn't play well to even things out.

100
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:40,303
Sure. Fine with me.

101
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:43,803
Sonoko, we're switching to doubles,

102
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,903
so pair with me, won't you?

103
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,203
Me?

104
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,303
Yeah. Please!

105
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:51,003
Sonoko, how lucky.

106
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,003
Yes, thanks!

107
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,603
He's putting us away and pairing with her?

108
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,503
What on earth is he thinking?

109
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,903
Coach Goto!

110
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:03,603
I'm counting on you.

111
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,903
Yes.

112
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,903
-Same here. -Yes!

113
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,603
I'll do my best!

114
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:12,003
Don't get too tensed up, okay?

115
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:16,603
Sonoko, I think it's better if you take off your glove!

116
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,603
What? Really?

117
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,603
Thank you very much!

118
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,003
Give it your best shot!

119
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:32,103
Sonoko give it your best shot!

120
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:35,403
Sonoko, go for it!

121
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:36,803
Go for it.

122
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,303
There!

123
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:42,903
I did it!

124
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:45,103
Sonoko, that's the way to go!

125
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:51,003
Sonoko seems to be getting the hang of it.

126
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,603
You're right.

127
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,703
Sonoko, fight!

128
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:02,303
What's wrong?

129
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,903
Mr. Goto suddenly doesn't seem to be doing good.

130
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,569
Coach?

131
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,469
What's up?

132
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,369
What's wrong?

133
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:18,969
Are you all right?

134
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,969
-Call an ambulance right away! -Okay.

135
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:25,969
Coach!

136
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,469
What's with this?

137
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:30,069
Mr. Goto!

138
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,369
What's going on?

139
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,669
The man who collapsed is Mr. Takao Goto.

140
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,469
21 years old.

141
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,369
He's the co-captain of the university tennis club.

142
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:41,769
It seems that he collapsed from poisoning

143
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,269
in the midst of a practice tennis match.

144
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:45,569
According to the hospital,

145
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,769
he seems to have the symptoms seen in aconitine derivatives.

146
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,469
I see. In other words,

147
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:52,869
Mr. Goto picked poison weeds that were growing nearby

148
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:55,369
and ate them?

149
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,669
No way, right?

150
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,869
Ran, so we meet again.

151
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:06,269
I guess, Inspector Yamamura.

152
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,169
I mean North Karuizawa is in Gunma Prefecture, you see.

153
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:13,369
An accident or food poisoning seems to be unthinkable.

154
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,269
The coroner says he seems to have been poisoned

155
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,169
10 to 20 minutes before he collapsed.

156
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,269
Which means,

157
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,269
this is a homicide targeted at Mr. Goto.

158
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,469
Mr. Goto isn't dead yet.

159
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,969
Somebody probably gave him poison

160
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,069
of some kind during the practice match and killed him.

161
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:33,469
So, like I was saying...

162
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,069
You mean it's not an accident?

163
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,469
Homicide?

164
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,369
But, how could the killer have done that

165
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,069
during the match in front of a crowd looking at the tennis court?

166
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:48,369
Come to think of it, the girls were giving something to Mr. Goto.

167
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:51,069
Giving him something?

168
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,969
It could be that the poison was inside what they gave him.

169
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:00,769
Okay! Have forensics rush and check the things they gave him.

170
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,869
Yes, sir!

171
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,969
Hang in there, Inspector.

172
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,669
No poison was found

173
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:10,069
when body checking the people involved.

174
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,669
However, toxic reaction was found on the bottle, towel

175
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,569
and racket grip tape that were handed over to him.

176
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:22,069
This, and this, then this...

177
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,969
Inspector Yamamura, what're you doing?

178
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:28,169
You see a lot of scenes like this on police dramas, don't you?

179
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,769
I wanted to do something like this before.

180
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,969
You currently are a police officer.

181
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,969
Mr. Goto's actions during break time

182
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,869
went something like this, right?

183
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:41,769
I saw Mr. Goto having a fight

184
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,669
with Ms. Tsuchida before the match in front of the locker.

185
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,369
Mr. Goto said that although he's going steady with Ms. Tsuchida,

186
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:52,169
he's being nice to Sonoko because she's rich.

187
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:54,169
Hey, just what do you think you're...

188
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,169
I see...

189
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,469
So, intent to kill built up in Ms. Tsuchida who didn't like the idea.

190
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,769
Hey, what's with this boy?

191
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,669
You mean the police is going to take

192
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,869
the testimony of a child like this as legit?

193
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,669
Ms. Tsuchida.

194
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:13,869
You gave Mr. Goto a drink with poison in it, didn't you?

195
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,069
No, I'm not.

196
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,069
Poison was detected on the outside of the bottle,

197
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:22,069
but not inside the drink.

198
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,269
Is that so?

199
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,069
Well, so it's not that his palms were inflamed

200
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,569
because he was holding the bottle that had poison on it firmly?

201
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:37,769
And, you miss, were talking to Mr. Goto here a while ago weren't you?

202
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,269
-I was... -I know about it.

203
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,469
Chie is giving Mr. Goto money in order to get his attention.

204
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,169
She's even using up her tuition for him.

205
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,269
Is that true?

206
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,769
Yes, if I can't pay my tuition

207
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:55,669
I'm going to have to quit college.

208
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:59,269
So, Ms. Ootake, you smeared poison on the towel

209
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,769
and gave it to him, didn't you?

210
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,469
If he wipes his eyes and nose with it,

211
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,269
the toxin would enter through his membranes.

212
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:07,169
I did no such thing!

213
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,369
According to the hospital,

214
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:13,169
no toxins were found on Mr. Goto's face.

215
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,369
Is that so?

216
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,569
Mr. Goto went through the match in a breeze

217
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,469
and he didn't perspire at all,

218
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,869
so he didn't use his towel.

219
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:23,569
He removed it from his neck and put it on the bench.

220
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,069
Since it's not us,

221
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,369
it has to be that rich girl of the Suzuki Financial Group.

222
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:31,869
Mr. Goto probably approached her wanting to get rich by marrying her.

223
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,569
She fell for him and when she found out about it,

224
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,469
she probably got angry and hated him.

225
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:40,269
No way, I didn't fall for the coach!

226
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,969
I heard he's entering a match, so I came to root for him!

227
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:47,769
He said that he changes his grip tape each game,

228
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,069
so I brought him some.

229
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:53,169
Does Mr. Goto change grip tapes for each game?

230
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:54,269
Yes...

231
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,769
I've figured it out!

232
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,569
The truth of this case has came to me as a flash of inspiration!

233
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,569
We will solve this case at the tennis court

234
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,269
because this case happened at the tennis court!

235
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,969
No joke?

236
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,969
In order to wrap the grip tape around,

237
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:14,669
first you have to peel off transparent film on adhesive side!

238
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,269
If poison is smeared onto this film,

239
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,969
the toxin will penetrate Mr. Goto's hand each time

240
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:23,669
he changes grip tapes when he plays a new game!

241
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,269
Inspector!

242
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,569
The forensics have reported back to us!

243
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:30,969
Toxin was detected on the used films found inside Mr. Goto's bag

244
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:35,669
and the tennis glove that belong to Sonoko!

245
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:38,069
From Sonoko's tennis glove too?

246
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,869
Just like I deduced.

247
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:45,269
Come to think of it, Mr. Goto licked his finger

248
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:48,769
repeatedly saying that the film was hard to peel off!

249
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,869
The killer, after smearing poison onto the films,

250
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:54,169
put them back in the case and gave it to him.

251
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:57,769
That's why no toxic reaction was detected from his body!

252
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,169
Yes! In other words, the murderer...

253
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,869
You, Ms. Suzuki!

254
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:04,169
What?

255
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,469
It can't be...

256
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,269
Hey...

257
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,313
Ms. Suzuki is the one who smeared poison

258
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,813
onto the grip tapes and gave it to him!

259
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,413
Inspector Yamamura.

260
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:20,613
She may fall in love easily, but she'd never do something like that.

261
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:21,913
That's right!

262
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,813
I didn't do it!

263
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:26,313
Since Mr. Goto licked his finger repeatedly

264
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:29,213
when peeling off the films the poison

265
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,613
was not taken into his body!

266
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:34,013
While he was playing, the poison circulated through his body,

267
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:37,613
he tried to shoot a serve and collapsed?

268
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,813
It hurts...

269
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,013
This is...

270
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,513
I get the picture now.

271
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,913
It hurts...

272
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:53,513
Her motive is an entangled love affair!

273
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,413
She threw herself onto a handsome coach

274
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,713
saying that she liked him but was betrayed.

275
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:00,413
So, her prince charming suddenly turned into her hated target

276
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,413
and intent to kill built up inside her!

277
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,213
Ms. Suzuki, come with us to the station.

278
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,313
Hey, I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

279
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:09,013
I'm sure that it's some kind of mistake!

280
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:12,113
After all, with this much circumstantial evidence before us.

281
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:14,513
-Stop it! -This is a false charge!

282
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,213
I guess Sonoko has to clear the accusations for herself!

283
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:27,413
I tell you, are you okay, Gunma Prefectural Police?

284
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,113
What's with her?

285
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,113
Is she copying Mr. Mouri?

286
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,413
Sonoko, so it's finally come!

287
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,913
Inspector Yamamura,

288
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,213
I will tell you the truth of this case from here!

289
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,213
-What? -What?

290
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,513
Wasn't the case solved already?

291
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:43,813
That girl is the culprit, isn't she?

292
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:45,213
That's right.

293
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,613
You smeared poison onto the film of the grip tape.

294
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,213
Mr. Goto started playing the match

295
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,613
right after he changed the grip tape,

296
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,013
so there's no way that poison would be found,

297
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:56,613
on the towel and bottle that he touched before that!

298
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,813
True, if you put it that way.

299
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:02,113
Besides, although you touch the film with the fingertips,

300
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:05,913
but only Mr. Goto's palm was inflamed from touching the poison.

301
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:09,213
Which means that the poison was all over Mr. Goto's palm!

302
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:11,913
I get it! Mr. Goto touched something

303
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:13,813
with poison on it with his hands!

304
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:16,313
So, the culprit is you, Ms. Tsuchida!

305
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:17,813
You smeared poison on the bottle,

306
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,113
since you wouldn't touch it with your own hands,

307
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,813
you held the strap and handed it over to him!

308
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,313
I didn't do it!

309
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:25,113
If the poison got onto his hand from the bottle,

310
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:26,413
then there's no way that the poison

311
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:28,613
would be on the towel that he touched before that.

312
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,513
Then, the culprit is Ms. Ootake!

313
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,513
When he touched the towel he had around his neck,

314
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:34,213
the poison got on Mr. Goto's hand!

315
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:35,613
Why would it be me?

316
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,013
Wrong!

317
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:40,713
If the poison touches the skin, a visual symptom would occur.

318
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:42,713
Since Ms. Ootake gave him the towel with her bare hands,

319
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,313
it's not the towel either.

320
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,113
Then, where did the poison come from?

321
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:49,713
Right! The tennis glove!

322
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:51,613
Maybe she shook hands with him

323
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:52,813
with the poisoned tennis glove on

324
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:55,413
and put poison on the palm of his hand?

325
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:56,813
I see...

326
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:59,813
Ms. Suzuki, so you're the culprit after all!

327
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:03,513
-Sonoko. -Ran!

328
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:05,313
That's impossible, you know?

329
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:10,913
Because you ate this cookie and yet you're alive and kicking.

330
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,013
Right!

331
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,513
Ran, just what do you mean?

332
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,713
When Sonoko was invited to come to the doubles

333
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,313
I high touched with her when she had her gloves on.

334
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:21,313
So, if there was poison on it

335
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:23,513
my hands would also be contaminated,

336
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:24,913
and since I ate cookies with the same hand,

337
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,813
but, I even now...

338
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,613
Really?

339
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:33,813
Then just where do you suggest the poison came from?

340
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:36,313
There're no more culprits left!

341
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:39,413
There was still another way to touch Mr. Goto

342
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,813
who was on the court and get poison on him.

343
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,413
It's something that all tennis players naturally do,

344
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,013
and also something that can be done

345
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,513
without getting suspicious even if it was done before a crowd.

346
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:53,813
Mr. Azuma, you're the culprit!

347
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:57,113
-What? -Captain?

348
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:58,513
Don't be ridiculous.

349
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:01,313
I was at the stands right the whole time and didn't offer anything to him.

350
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,213
How could I poison him, who was at the tennis court?

351
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,813
It was when you did a high touch with Mr. Goto.

352
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:08,313
During that split second,

353
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:11,413
you smeared poisoned Mr. Goto's palm with poison!

354
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:14,113
-What? -What?

355
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:18,113
The fact that poison was found on my tennis glove

356
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:21,213
is because the poison was already there on Mr. Goto's palm

357
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:23,713
even before he shook hands with me.

358
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:27,213
If so, you're the only one who high touched him

359
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,813
before he shook hands with me.

360
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:30,513
It's absurd.

361
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:32,313
If I had my hand smeared with poison,

362
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:34,713
my hand would be in terrible shape too, wouldn't it?

363
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,413
It's after you put on your tennis glove.

364
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,913
There are only two balls in a tennis match,

365
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,713
if it comes flying to the stands, it's manners to return it to court.

366
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:45,113
But, since you had poison smeared on the palm of your glove,

367
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:48,113
you bounced the ball back with the back of your hand.

368
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,713
And when the match was suddenly switched to a doubles game

369
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,613
and I was chosen to become Mr. Goto's partner,

370
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:58,013
I'm sure you panicked.

371
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,913
Because if the police detected the poison from my glove

372
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:04,413
and suspects someone from the stands held the source of the poison,

373
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,713
your plan would go down the drain.

374
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,213
Therefore...

375
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,113
Sonoko, I think it's better if you take off your glove!

376
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:15,313
You made me take off my glove.

377
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:17,013
If it were on the bench or something,

378
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:21,713
it would've been gotten rid of amidst the commotion and all by now.

379
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:24,713
I'm amazed by your deduction.

380
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:27,013
As if I want to say that.

381
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:28,713
But, just where do you have evidence?

382
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:30,813
The evidence is right here!

383
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:35,113
This ball...

384
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:38,713
When Inspector Yamamura kicked the ball basket a while ago,

385
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:41,213
there was one ball that didn't bounce,

386
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,913
so I thought it was strange.

387
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:47,813
There's a strange slit here on this ball.

388
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,713
This is...

389
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,613
After doing what he had to do,

390
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,513
Mr. Azuma took off the poisoned glove

391
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,513
and shoved it inside that ball.

392
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:58,313
Then, he mixed it into the ball basket

393
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,813
so it would be inconspicuous.

394
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:02,413
You were probably planning to get rid of it,

395
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:05,413
after the commotion subsided.

396
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,413
If Mr. Azuma's fingerprints and toxic reaction are found on this glove,

397
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,013
that would be conclusive evidence.

398
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:15,713
So, could this mean that I solved this case?

399
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,513
I did it, fantastic!

400
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,813
Just as expected of me.

401
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:23,213
Why would a kind captain like him do something like that?

402
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:29,313
I was scheduled to play in the match tomorrow,

403
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,213
but Goto who was envious of me

404
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,213
deliberately tripped me during practice!

405
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:42,613
I'd never trip and fall like you, Azuma.

406
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:47,113
I couldn't enter the match since I sprained a bone in my leg.

407
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,513
And Goto ended up taking my place.

408
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:53,913
To think that the dirty woman chaser stole my position.

409
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:56,313
Thanks to him, both contract with the sponsor

410
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,313
and the scholarship went up in smoke.

411
00:20:58,313 --> 00:21:02,113
I just couldn't forgive him!

412
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,513
So, Sonoko was cleared of all suspicion.

413
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:11,013
Afterward, Mr. Goto regained his consciousness at the hospital

414
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,813
and his prognosis looked positive,

415
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,113
according to Inspector Yamamura.

416
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:40,113
Deduction Queen Sonoko, great work!

417
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:43,113
Really?

418
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:47,613
To think you would end up being the culprit,

419
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,113
I was dead worried.

420
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:53,013
Ran, you're sure a great friend!

421
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:56,313
So, the case is closed.

422
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:57,913
Right!

423
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:00,613
-Yes! -Yes. It hurts...

424
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,113
It hurts. How could you, Ms. Suzuki?

425
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,113
It hurts...

426
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:07,513
Darn. Case is closed, my eye!

427
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,913
As if he had such a scrutinizing mind.

428
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,313
I guess the grudge of being set up as a suspect

429
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:15,013
is not easily forgotten.
