1
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:03,448
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:05,348
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:07,148
A mysterious elderly couple moves into a new house.

4
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:09,048
A presence and sense of being watched that sprout concern.

5
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:10,848
Am I the target or is it Ai?

6
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:12,348
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:14,148
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,448
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,722
To Beikacho, right?

10
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,322
Okay.

11
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:41,722
Hey. Do you know that a new house was built near your house, Conan?

12
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,322
A new house?

13
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:45,022
No.

14
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,422
What kind of house is it?

15
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:47,822
Is it big?

16
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:51,622
No, it's small and very cute!

17
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,422
The house suits your taste, doesn't it, Ayumi?

18
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,622
Yep!

19
00:02:56,622 --> 00:03:00,122
I thought that I'd like to live in a house like that after I get married.

20
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,122
-What? -What?

21
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,122
-Married? -Married?

22
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,022
Conan, would you like to go see it on our way home?

23
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,622
What?

24
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:15,622
Nothing.

25
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:18,622
Come on, Ayumi. Let's just all of us go!

26
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:21,122
Just leave that guy alone, okay?

27
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:24,022
What? Why are coming along, too?

28
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:25,722
The same to you, Mitsuhiko.

29
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,622
Conan! Quick!

30
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,522
Why are you asking Conan to come?

31
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:31,022
Right!

32
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,922
What's the matter?

33
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:37,022
Nothing.

34
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:40,022
I just felt like someone is watching me.

35
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:41,622
Maybe it's just my imagination.

36
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:57,722
"The Grenier House on Beikacho"

37
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:00,722
I see.

38
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,222
So it's this house.

39
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:06,822
Here you go. Mitsuhiko, open your mouth.

40
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:13,222
Genta, you finished eating already?

41
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,822
Hey, hey.

42
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,922
What are you all imagining?

43
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,222
It's really a small and cute house.

44
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:21,422
Don't you think so?

45
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:24,022
And Conan, do you like houses like this?

46
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:25,222
What?

47
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,222
-Me? -Yes, you.

48
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:28,422
Ayumi!

49
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,722
How come you're asking Conan?

50
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,722
He's out of the picture.

51
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:36,122
Because he may become my husband in the future.

52
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,022
So I'd like to know what kind of things he likes.

53
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,622
Hey, Ayumi!

54
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:46,222
Then you've got to see the inside of the house at all costs, too.

55
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:47,222
What?

56
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,722
So, will you show us inside?

57
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:54,422
You've got to be kidding.

58
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:57,522
Just because I didn't say anything about your ridiculous conversation.

59
00:04:57,522 --> 00:05:00,622
Her parents are looking for a house right now, you know.

60
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:03,022
If she likes the house...

61
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,822
They may just buy the house.

62
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,322
Let me show you in!

63
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,422
There are two 6-mat western style rooms, a bathroom with a bath tub

64
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:20,222
with a changing room on the 1st floor.

65
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:22,822
Are the two western style rooms for children?

66
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,022
Yes.

67
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,822
It seems that the person who built this house had in mind

68
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:31,422
a couple in their 30's with two children, a total family of four.

69
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:35,422
On the 2nd floor is a 16-mat living room and a kitchen.

70
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:36,422
How spacious!

71
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,922
It's nice and sunny, too!

72
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,222
There is an 8-mat western style room towards the roadside.

73
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,822
There's a 3rd floor, too.

74
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:48,222
Yes, the selling point of this house is the Grenier.

75
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,022
This is interesting!

76
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,922
There's a window here, too!

77
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,222
You can see the sky!

78
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:01,822
You can watch the stars at night, too.

79
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:14,022
Detective agency?

80
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:16,522
It's in view from here.

81
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,322
How did you like it?

82
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:23,722
The Grenier and the 2nd floor living room were nice.

83
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:26,522
Both rooms on the 1st floor were kind of dark.

84
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,822
A larger yard would be better, too.

85
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,222
The stairs were a bit too steep, too.

86
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:36,122
But for a house built on a small lot, I think it's pretty well made.

87
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,922
And will you recommend this house to your parents?

88
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:41,022
What?

89
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,722
Well, of course...

90
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,622
Now that we have seen the inside,

91
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:47,622
let's go.

92
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,622
The layout was not all that great.

93
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,722
My house is a lot more comfy to live in!

94
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,422
What? That house was sold?

95
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:07,222
Yep, when I passed by yesterday with mother,

96
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:09,222
the "For Sale" sign was folded,

97
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,222
so I asked.

98
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,822
That's too bad,

99
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,722
since you seemed to like it, Ayumi.

100
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:18,522
But the inside wasn't all that great.

101
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,022
No need to be disappointed, Ayumi.

102
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:23,422
I'll build you a better house.

103
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:26,622
Why are you going to build a house for Ayumi, Genta?

104
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:28,722
I'm the one who's going to build her house!

105
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:33,822
I wonder if the buyer was a couple in their 30's with two children?

106
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:35,222
Well, I guess so.

107
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,822
Nope.

108
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,822
They were an elderly couple way into the 70's.

109
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:42,522
An elderly couple?

110
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:47,522
Strange. That house isn't made for elderly people to live in.

111
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,922
You're right.

112
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:52,122
It has three floors and the stairs are steep, too.

113
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:59,622
But everyone has their own reason, so I guess it's okay.

114
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,822
Hisashi Udo?

115
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,822
What a queer name.

116
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,222
You guys.

117
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,422
Since there's a name plate, it means...

118
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:16,522
They've already moved in.

119
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,422
What brings you guys here?

120
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:22,022
We figured you'd be concerned and come look.

121
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:26,322
Even if it's a trivial thing, if in doubt, check it out thoroughly.

122
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,422
That's the basics of a detective!

123
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:29,822
Hey, hey.

124
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,722
My, hello!

125
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,422
Hello...

126
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:39,622
Do all of you live in this neighbourhood?

127
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:43,222
We just moved in today.

128
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,022
If it's okay with you,

129
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:47,922
please come in and tell me all kind of things about this town.

130
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,822
Yes! Sure!

131
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,622
If it's about Beikacho, you can count on us!

132
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:56,022
I even know which shop sells the best eels over rice and its cheap, too!

133
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,222
Right.

134
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,722
There.

135
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,322
Here goes.

136
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,622
I'll be going, then.

137
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:09,122
Goodbye.

138
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:10,722
Goodbye...

139
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,022
So you're all detectives?

140
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,722
Yes! The Youth Detective Squad of Teitan Elementary...

141
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,322
Is known by everyone in Beikacho.

142
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:27,522
We're just as well-known as Kojima Liquor Store.

143
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:28,522
-Here you go. -What?

144
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:31,222
-Thank you. -Is that so?

145
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:36,822
I'm sorry. The furniture hasn't arrived yet.

146
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:37,922
Not at all.

147
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,222
Grandma.

148
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:42,122
Are you going to live here with the elderly man who went out a while ago?

149
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:43,222
That's right.

150
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:45,822
The stairs seem steep, but aren't you afraid?

151
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:46,922
Not at all.

152
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:52,122
I've always wanted to live in a house like this since I was young.

153
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:55,022
I think I know how you feel.

154
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:59,822
My grandma said she wanted to try living in a tower condo once, too!

155
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:03,722
Besides, this house is close to the house our only son lives in.

156
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:05,622
I see.

157
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:08,122
But please do be careful.

158
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:10,522
Thank you. It's so nice of you.

159
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:13,922
Thank you for everything.

160
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:15,322
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

161
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,022
Our doubts have been cleared.

162
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:21,822
That couple bought that house because their son lives nearby.

163
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:25,622
She also said she wanted to live in that type of house.

164
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:28,522
But something bothers me.

165
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:29,622
What does?

166
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:33,322
Well, I can't really say.

167
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:38,322
What? The day after tomorrow?

168
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:39,522
Yeah.

169
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:40,722
What is it?

170
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:42,922
What is it that's bugging me?

171
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:48,122
I've always wanted to live in a house like this since I was young.

172
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:49,622
Here goes.

173
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:51,822
Is it this?

174
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,922
Is this what's bothering me?

175
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:56,322
But any elderly man would do so.

176
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,622
More than that, back then...

177
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,122
Why was she wearing that look on her face?

178
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:04,022
Hey, hey. Conan, are you listening?

179
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,122
Like I was saying,

180
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,222
dad and I have to attend a memorial service tomorrow and will be late,

181
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,522
please watch the house.

182
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:12,822
Gosh, Conan.

183
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,522
I see. Sorry, sorry.

184
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:19,022
Hey, don't ponder when you're eating!

185
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,522
It hurts!

186
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:25,722
Dad!

187
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:26,677
Shoots.

188
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:40,777
A cab? Bummers.

189
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:44,477
Darn it!

190
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:51,677
Shinichi, what are you doing in a place like this?

191
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,777
Doc? All right!

192
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,277
Talk about good timing!

193
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:56,577
What?

194
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:57,677
Could you...

195
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,877
go after that cab up front?

196
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,177
Doc! Hurry!

197
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,177
Yeah. Okay.

198
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:08,377
Although it bothers you,

199
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:13,077
there's nothing unnatural about the activity of the old man.

200
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:17,877
Old people usually use their hands for support when standing up.

201
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,177
I thought so, too.

202
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:23,577
The old lady probably frowned

203
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:27,477
because she's been telling him time and again to get up smoothly.

204
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,877
She probably doesn't like her husband acting too old.

205
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:34,077
Although Genta always told me that I act like an old fart, too.

206
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,577
Old fart!

207
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,877
I'm sorry to have bothered you on your way shopping.

208
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,177
Go on ahead home.

209
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,577
Okay.

210
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,877
I understand you want to check things out until you're convinced,

211
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,677
but are you going to be okay alone?

212
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:53,877
Don't worry.

213
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,277
Shinichi.

214
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:58,577
I wonder what Ai would do at a time like this?

215
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:40,777
Yes!

216
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:43,477
For things like that...

217
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:47,077
I'll cooperate anytime if I can be of help.

218
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:53,577
Shoots!

219
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,177
That was so close!

220
00:14:57,177 --> 00:15:00,477
I came home leaving things as is.

221
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,877
Who on earth is that Chinese man?

222
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:05,077
And who is that old man...

223
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,177
exactly?

224
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,977
Isn't that from the direction of the Grenier house?

225
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:14,977
Don't tell me that...

226
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:28,677
The skylight of the Grenier house.

227
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,377
A camera?

228
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:31,677
Moreover,

229
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:34,377
why is it facing towards the detective agency?

230
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:36,477
Are they taking pictures of Pops?

231
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,077
Or...

232
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:39,477
What's the matter?

233
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:40,477
Nothing.

234
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,777
I just felt like someone is watching me.

235
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,877
Am I the target?

236
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,877
If so...

237
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,277
Don't tell me they're the guys from Black Organization?

238
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,877
How about it, Haibara?

239
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,377
Have you ever seen them in the organization?

240
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:09,577
I see.

241
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:13,577
But they could be in disguise.

242
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:14,777
In disguise?

243
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:15,777
Yes.

244
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,077
Disguise?

245
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,377
Shinichi...

246
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:15,877
So it's you after all, mom.

247
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:24,977
Long time no see, Yukiko.

248
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,777
Dr. Agasa.

249
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:28,777
He got us, Yukiko.

250
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,777
This time, he got Doc to act on his side.

251
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:33,577
He paid us back for what we did some time ago.

252
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,877
But how did you find out?

253
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:43,177
Give me an explanation before you ask me questions.

254
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,777
What do you think you're doing, pulling off something like this?

255
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:48,977
We came back to Japan in the morning the day before yesterday

256
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:51,577
for Yusaku's next interview job.

257
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,277
To Beikacho, right?

258
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:55,577
Okay.

259
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,077
After we stopped over at the house,

260
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,977
I got worried about you

261
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:04,177
and went alone to check you at the elementary school.

262
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:07,577
You just happened to come out with your friend.

263
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:10,777
Conan! Quick!

264
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:12,577
Why are you asking Conan to come?

265
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:13,977
Right!

266
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:16,777
You're really sharp, Shinichi.

267
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:18,777
I thought you saw through me.

268
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:26,477
I was relieved to see that you are doing well,

269
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:29,877
but I was thinking that I wanted to see how you were living

270
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:33,277
after becoming Conan before leaving for the States

271
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:35,077
without letting you know.

272
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:38,577
You didn't have to start feeling that way.

273
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:42,077
But when I was walking, I was thinking about

274
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:46,477
the way I could watch you without being noticed.

275
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:49,577
I coincidentally found that house.

276
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:52,277
Though it was small, I liked the house

277
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:54,477
and I didn't intend to get it at first.

278
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,577
From the window of the Grenier,

279
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:00,177
the detective agency is in view!

280
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:03,477
That's when she came upon this striking thought.

281
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,777
We'll just rent the house for a week,

282
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,577
disguised as an elderly couple and watch your lifestyle secretly

283
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:13,477
from the window of the Grenier.

284
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:17,377
Yusaku thought that my idea was amusing, too.

285
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:23,277
So we went to the realtor to ask if it was okay.

286
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:26,577
It turns out the president happened to be a great fan of mine.

287
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:29,177
-Here you go. -Thank you.

288
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:34,477
He immediately agreed.

289
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:40,377
I was really surprised when all of you came the following day though.

290
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:47,177
Since I'm an actress, I had confidence that I could deceive you,

291
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:49,677
but as for Yusaku...

292
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:53,877
Yeah. That acting of yours was what got me thinking, dad.

293
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:55,777
Here goes.

294
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:58,577
But that's...

295
00:19:58,577 --> 00:19:59,577
Yeah.

296
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:01,077
Like you said Doc,

297
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,277
it's only natural for elderly men

298
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:04,677
to use their hand to support themselves when getting up,

299
00:20:04,677 --> 00:20:07,677
but that's only when nobody's watching.

300
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:10,277
In front of people, they try with all their might not to show it.

301
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,377
I feel that's the psyche of elderly people.

302
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,777
Yes, even in the world of acting,

303
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:19,177
when people act as elderly people, they are inclined to act that way.

304
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,877
That's why you frowned when he did so, right?

305
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,077
You saw?

306
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:27,877
Right. I thought, "Oh no, he did it."

307
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,677
It can't be help, can it?

308
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:33,377
After all, I'm a suspense novel writer and not an actor.

309
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:36,177
But your acting was pretty good too, dad.

310
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:39,177
You knew that Doc and I were tailing you, right?

311
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:41,977
Sort of.

312
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:44,077
The Chinese owner of the shop

313
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,177
used to be the head of a chivalrous group of robbers

314
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:48,477
that raided the great continent during his younger days.

315
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:51,877
I went to the shop to interview him about my upcoming "Night Baron" Series.

316
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:57,577
"Night Baron vs. Mysterious Chinese Man"

317
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,977
I asked him to scare you a bit.

318
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:06,077
I was really surprised when he threw the dagger at you.

319
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:07,377
Yusaku!

320
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:14,077
At any rate, don't you think that's going a bit too far?

321
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,677
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:21,277
But I was really worried about the kind of life you were living,

323
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,677
since we've been living away from you for a while.

324
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,377
If I were to see you in person and ask you,

325
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:28,077
you would naturally say that everything's okay, right?

326
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,777
I wanted to know...

327
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:32,077
I wanted to know the real genuine fact.

328
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,477
Mom.

329
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,277
Besides,

330
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:43,077
I wanted a lot of pictures of you...

331
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:48,077
as a child again!

332
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,977
You win, mom.

333
00:23:26,877 --> 00:23:30,977
That elderly couple already moved, didn't they?

334
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,777
The house wasn't suited for elderly people after all.

335
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,377
But their name was sure interesting.

336
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:39,877
What was it?

337
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,777
Hisashi Udo.

338
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:45,677
Why didn't I realize something so simple?

339
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:50,077
All I had to do was interchange the characters of Udoku.

340
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:54,777
Oh, well.

341
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:34,845
Next Conan's Hint:

342
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:36,345
"Sightseeing spot"

343
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:37,645
What does the sightseeing spot bring to mind?

344
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,045
-Seeing eye dog! -A seer!

345
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,149
-Kyoto. -What a wet blanket.
