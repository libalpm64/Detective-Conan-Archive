1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,710
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,510
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,010
A code like cell phone mail.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,610
Pops is pondering when a cat appears!

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,010
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,610
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,710
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:00,043
At 9:00 in the morning, I have to meet a client.

9
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:02,343
From 10:00 to after 1:00 in the afternoon,

10
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:05,843
I'll have lunch at Poirot while enjoying a relaxing coffee time.

11
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,043
Then from 2:00, I get to watch the long awaited drama series

12
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:13,443
starring Yoko Okino while video taping it.

13
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:16,543
And I'll take consideration making deductions from the plot.

14
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,943
No. Wait.

15
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:19,943
I'll quickly watch five previous episodes

16
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:21,643
while waiting for the client to arrive.

17
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:24,743
Not bad a plan since I can review the storyline.

18
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:28,843
Talk about being busy!

19
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:31,443
What a satisfying life I'm leading.

20
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,643
Hey.

21
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:36,143
Just what're you guys doing?

22
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:38,243
It's already time to go to school, isn't it?

23
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,243
Well...

24
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:43,543
What is it?

25
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,843
Are you hiding something from me?

26
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:48,343
Well, it's not something weird or anything.

27
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:54,143
What the... It's just a cat.

28
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,043
What?

29
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:01,543
A cat?

30
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,143
A cat!

31
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:15,643
"Secret of the Russian Blue"

32
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,143
Hey, hey.

33
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:20,143
Don't tell me you picked up a stray.

34
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:21,743
Well, no.

35
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,543
It's Aunty Eri's cat.

36
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,243
Eri?

37
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:29,843
If I remember correctly, she had a black and brown cat.

38
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:33,243
It wasn't this strange mouse like gray colour, was it?

39
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:35,743
It's called a Russian Blue.

40
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:39,343
It's known for its blue-gray fur and green eyes.

41
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,943
The cat she had before died a month ago,

42
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,543
so she got this cat from an acquaintance of hers.

43
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,543
Her previous cat was pretty aged already.

44
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:51,843
And why is that cat in my office?

45
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:55,443
Because mother came just a while ago and...

46
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,043
Sorry, Ran.

47
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,143
Will you watch this cat for three days?

48
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,843
What's up?

49
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,843
I have to fly on an afternoon flight to Okinawa

50
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,343
where a client of mine is working.

51
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:10,343
Ms. Kuriyama who was supposed to take care of him is bedridden with flu.

52
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:12,243
But...

53
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:15,343
I have nobody else I can ask but you right now, Ran.

54
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:17,043
Okay?

55
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,643
Wait, Mom.

56
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,043
Take care of Goro for me, okay?

57
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,443
That's the story.

58
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:27,543
Take care of the cat?

59
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:31,343
But while you guys are at school, I'm the one who has to watch it.

60
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:36,143
Good morning, Ran!

61
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,343
Sonoko!

62
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,943
We're going to be late, Ran.

63
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:42,443
Is there something I should know?

64
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,443
Sorry, I'll be right there.

65
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,143
Bye, Dad!

66
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:48,143
Hey!

67
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,643
Take care of Goro for me, Dad.

68
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:57,343
I see.

69
00:04:57,343 --> 00:04:58,443
But, Ran,

70
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:01,543
wasn't the name of the previous cat she had also Goro?

71
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,643
Yeah.

72
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:06,843
I think mom likes that name and gave him the same name again.

73
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:09,943
She says she named it Goro because its always rolling around doing nothing.

74
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,443
But I think the real reason is...

75
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,943
Gosh.

76
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:19,843
Why must a great detective like me take care of a cat?

77
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:21,643
It's easy because its already toilet trained

78
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:25,843
and all you have to do is make sure it doesn't run outside.

79
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,743
You watch it then.

80
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:30,143
You can play hooky today.

81
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,543
I give you permission to do so.

82
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,343
Give me permission, I mean...

83
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:39,343
I'm busy all day today.

84
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:41,543
Excuse me.

85
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:44,043
I'm the one who called you last night. My name is Kirishita.

86
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,043
What? I thought we agreed to meet at 9:00 over the phone.

87
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:50,343
Moreover, I thought I was told your wife would be coming.

88
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:53,743
The thing is, my wife fell ill,

89
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,943
so I stopped by here on my way to work in her place

90
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:58,643
and brought my daughter's code with me.

91
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,743
A code?

92
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,743
This is indeed

93
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,043
a code.

94
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,643
Yes.

95
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:11,743
This is an e-mail that my daughter mistakenly sent to my cell phone.

96
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,443
I don't understand what it means

97
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:16,943
and my daughter kept on telling me to erase it right away.

98
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,143
I've come to ask for your help

99
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:21,443
thinking that maybe it could be something that needs attention.

100
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:24,643
What is it?

101
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,243
Oh, well...

102
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:29,443
It just reminded me of "Speckled Cat Holmes".

103
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:32,043
You know, the cat that appears in Jiro Akagawa's novel.

104
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:37,743
Right.

105
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:40,043
In the first story of "Speckled Cat Holmes",

106
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,543
Holmes is sitting on someone's shoulder.

107
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,343
Which means if a Russian Blue is trained,

108
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:47,543
it can ride on a shoulder too, right?

109
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:49,643
-I see. -Yeah.

110
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,743
Hey, hurry and go to school!

111
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:54,743
Okay!

112
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:58,943
I thought you told me to play hooky just a while ago.

113
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:03,543
Well, this mail does seem to smell a bit dangerous.

114
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:05,843
So you think so too, Mr. Mouri?

115
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,343
Yes.

116
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,643
The most I can make out of it is the second line, "Kare" (He),

117
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:15,843
and the last part of the third line, "Tsukiatte" (Go with me).

118
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,343
That's right.

119
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:20,643
My daughter is in the second year of high school,

120
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:23,543
but it seems that she's recently working part-time in secret.

121
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,443
I'm worried that maybe she's being deceived by some bad man somewhere

122
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:28,443
and dishing money out to him.

123
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,843
The fact is that my wife fell ill because of this, too.

124
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:33,243
I see.

125
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,543
Second year of high school...

126
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:39,643
It sure is an age surrounded by many dangers.

127
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:42,643
My daughter is also in her second year of high school.

128
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:46,743
And she seems to be concerned about this leery detective kid.

129
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:49,943
Hey, I told you to hurry up and go to school!

130
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:52,343
I forgot something.

131
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:53,743
Gosh.

132
00:07:55,843 --> 00:08:01,143
Maybe it's a code that is popular among young girls.

133
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:04,543
I thought so, too.

134
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:07,643
So I asked the daughter of one of my colleagues at work.

135
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:10,543
And, what did she say?

136
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,543
Well...

137
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:18,243
She chuckled as soon as she saw the mail.

138
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,943
Why don't you let her do as she likes?

139
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:23,243
That is what she said.

140
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,443
While smiling mischievously.

141
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:29,043
Maybe it's a dirty mail after all.

142
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:35,143
For the time being, please forward this mail to my cell phone.

143
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,243
All right.

144
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,743
I'll contact you as soon as I figure it out.

145
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:43,143
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:49,943
See you later, Goro.

147
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,443
Take care of Pops, okay?

148
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:02,043
I don't have the slightest idea, no matter how many times I look at it.

149
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,143
I guess I'll go wash my face and freshen up.

150
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,243
He was in the bathroom.

151
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:18,943
Gosh, what a nuisance.

152
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:23,243
Well, if it's as smart as the speckled cat in the novel,

153
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,243
it's another story.

154
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,443
What the heck?

155
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:34,443
That cat has been sleeping on this towel!

156
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,443
Hey, you cat!

157
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,243
Just what do you think you're doing?

158
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:44,143
These are videos of Yoko's drama series!

159
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:48,643
If you scratch them, I won't forgive you!

160
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:51,843
The second episode's not here.

161
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:54,043
Don't tell me you hid it somewhere?

162
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:02,343
Hey, this time it's a shoe?

163
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:07,943
This is Conan's shoe.

164
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:10,243
Just where did you bring it from?

165
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,343
Listen. You need two shoes to form a pair.

166
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:16,443
They're of no use if they were separated.

167
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:17,643
Remember that!

168
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:22,143
Gosh.

169
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:25,143
Sneaking in and bringing things without permission.

170
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,943
He is not Holmes, but Lupin.

171
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,143
I see, I see.

172
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:33,943
This letter that looks like an "O" with strand of hair on it

173
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:37,143
must be the Greek alphabet "S" (sigma)

174
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:40,443
This letter that looks like a distorted "V" is the Greek alphabet "nyu".

175
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:45,643
The letter that looks like the hiragana "te" is the Greek alphabet "tau".

176
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:50,243
Which means the letters that formed "please come with me"

177
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:52,643
are read as "Please come witauh me".

178
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,543
What's this?

179
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:57,243
The Greek alphabet may stand for the names of stars.

180
00:10:57,243 --> 00:11:00,243
It may have something to do with stars.

181
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,843
I'm sure that there was a book on stars around here some place.

182
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:10,543
Darn it! Playing pranks again!

183
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:14,643
An English-Japanese Dictionary?

184
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:18,643
English-Japanese means translating English to Japanese.

185
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:25,043
In this e-mail, the English alphabet that is used is only "W".

186
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:28,543
But if this "W" were to be forcibly changed to Japanese...

187
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:32,543
I guess it could pass for the hiragana "n"!

188
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,943
I see!

189
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,443
I wonder if she's using foreign letters

190
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:39,143
that look like Japanese hiragana and katakana just for fun?

191
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:43,443
That's why instead of "tsukiatte", she used "tsukiatau".

192
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:47,843
If so, I feel like I'll be able to read it.

193
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,943
Good work, Goro.

194
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,543
Wait.

195
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,443
Don't tell me this cat

196
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:57,043
was trying to tell me all this?

197
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:08,848
Could it be like in the novel?

198
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:11,948
Hey!

199
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,748
This is not a toy!

200
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,448
It's no more than a cat after all.

201
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,148
At any rate, she had purposely substituted

202
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,748
foreign characters for hiragana and katakana.

203
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:31,448
And it's obvious that our young lady wrote this message in a playful way.

204
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:33,648
I'll take that into consideration.

205
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:36,248
"W" equals the hiragana "n".

206
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:38,448
And "nu" equals the katakana "re".

207
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:41,248
"Tau" equals the hiragana "te".

208
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:44,548
So, the symbol equal would stand for the katakana "ni"

209
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:47,848
and the postal code symbol equals the katakana "de".

210
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,548
But...

211
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:52,548
"Ni-de-de-ku"?

212
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,648
What on earth does it mean?

213
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:58,248
It seems that the "S" that comes after the "W" and before hiragana "tsu"

214
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,348
has to be solved before this can be read.

215
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:05,048
But there's no such letter in hiragana or katakana.

216
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:08,548
So I'll use a circle to mark the unknown symbols and go from there.

217
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:23,848
"Yo-nn-gen-en-reka-re-niteteku"

218
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:26,448
I wonder if this is some kind of code after all?

219
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:33,148
Hey!

220
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:43,748
Darn it.

221
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:48,848
Hey, not again!

222
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:52,748
I told you not to come here.

223
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,648
It's already past 12:00!

224
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:02,648
It's less than two hours to Yoko's drama.

225
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:06,348
I've got to solve the contents of this mail before then.

226
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:09,848
Otherwise, I won't be able to watch Yoko's drama in peace.

227
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:15,448
Wait. Come to think of it,

228
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:20,048
he was doing something among the video tapes a while ago, too.

229
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,548
Maybe he's trying to tell me something again.

230
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,048
The thing that bothers me now

231
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:27,748
is that the video tape for the second episode is gone.

232
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:30,748
Gone... Lacking?

233
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:31,848
Wait, wait.

234
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:35,948
Before that, he was sleeping on the towel in the bathroom.

235
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:38,248
And his cat hair got on all over my face.

236
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,048
I see!

237
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,748
Remove and lacking.

238
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:48,348
Maybe these letters not only look like hiragana and katakana,

239
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,448
but are actually scribbles that young girls nowadays

240
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:55,148
use a lot in writing words to make them look cute?

241
00:14:56,448 --> 00:15:01,048
In that case, the sigma must mean a certain hiragana or katakana

242
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,848
but with missing or dropped parts.

243
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:06,948
If so, the letter I can think of is...

244
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,948
The hiragana "no".

245
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:13,048
Then this plus-minus sign

246
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:16,548
is the hiragana "chi".

247
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,448
Which means the plus-minus, "W" and sigma are...

248
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:22,448
"Chi-chinno?"

249
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,048
What is this?

250
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,648
No. If something were added to the right of the plus-minus sign,

251
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:29,648
it would turn out as the hiragana "chi",

252
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,048
but what if something was added to the left?

253
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,448
It'll turn into "sa"!

254
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,448
So if this is "sa",

255
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,948
then the plus-minus, "W", and sigma will be...

256
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:41,248
"Sa-n-no".

257
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:45,448
Could it be that it should go before someone's name?

258
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:48,248
The problem is the arrow before the plus-minus.

259
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:53,548
I've seen this arrow on Sonoko's New Year's postcard before.

260
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,248
What's with that arrow?

261
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,948
Oh, this means...

262
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:01,848
"Happy New Year!"

263
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:05,148
I see. The arrow is a dash.

264
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,748
It's used when you want to make a long sound.

265
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,148
In that case, the name that goes before the plus-minus

266
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,948
should be Sato or Taro,

267
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:15,148
a name that has a long sound at the end of it.

268
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:18,248
Okay! I'll solve this code all at once.

269
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,748
Darn it!

270
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:28,548
"Please go with me".

271
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:32,248
"Ni-te-te-ku-no-tsu-ki-a-tte".

272
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:34,648
It's almost readable but not quite.

273
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:37,548
Names that start with "yo"

274
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:40,948
and end with a long sound are "Yo-jo" or "Yo-ichiro".

275
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,048
No matter how I look at it, it doesn't look that way.

276
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:49,748
Hey, you.

277
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,948
Stop playing with my shoe!

278
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,248
Shoe?

279
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,848
Come to think of it,

280
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:59,648
he was playing with Conan's shoe.

281
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:02,148
Moreover, with only one side.

282
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:04,648
Back then, I...

283
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,648
Listen. You need two shoes to form a pair.

284
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:12,048
They're of no use if they're separated.

285
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,448
Two makes a pair.

286
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:18,148
Spaces for two characters were being used to display one character.

287
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:21,448
That is, "koto" means "words" and "en" means "extend" in the first row.

288
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:23,248
If written as one word, the kanji character "tan" will be (tanjo=birth).

289
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:27,348
And the two postal marks in the third row form "gyou" or "to go".

290
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,548
Wait.

291
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,848
Then the first hiragana character is "yo",

292
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:34,648
and if you add on the missing parts,

293
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:38,748
that is the hiragana character "ku" that is on the side,

294
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,948
it'll make the hiragana character "o".

295
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,348
And for the following character,

296
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:47,548
if I pair the "L" with the mirrored version of the hiragana "tsu",

297
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,248
it becomes the hiragana "to".

298
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,948
The letter on the second line which looks like flattened katakana "fu"

299
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,548
and the little circle make the katakana "pu".

300
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:58,448
If I read the second line keeping all this in mind, I get "pu-re-ka-i-ni".

301
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:02,148
It means "buy birthday present"!

302
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,448
All right, if I keep reading...

303
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:09,048
"Go with me to buy my father's birthday present."

304
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,148
It's pretty easy to read girlish writing.

305
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:13,248
Girlish writing?

306
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:14,948
Hey, Dad.

307
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:18,348
I hope you didn't lay your hands on a young girl or something?

308
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,648
Oh, no.

309
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:22,748
This is an e-mail that a client asked me to decipher for him.

310
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:26,548
Wait. Why are you all here?

311
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,348
What about school?

312
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,848
We went.

313
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:31,748
Just what are you talking about, Pops?

314
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:33,048
It's already sundown.

315
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,748
Then, hurry up and make dinner!

316
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:39,048
Yes, sir.

317
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,348
Let's go, Ran.

318
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:42,848
I'm home.

319
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:43,948
Hi!

320
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,948
Oh, glasses kid.

321
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:48,548
Gosh.

322
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:51,148
They snatch away all the good parts.

323
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:59,548
Even though we solved it all by ourselves, right?

324
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:05,048
I guess I'll call the client right now.

325
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,848
The bonito strategy worked out great.

326
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:28,348
I snuck bonito in places and on things that would serve as clues

327
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:29,848
and made the cat mess around in the area,

328
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:32,648
so that Pops would catch the hint.

329
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:35,348
It seems to have worked out well.

330
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,448
Hello, Mr. Kirishita?

331
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:40,748
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri, whom you came to see early this morning.

332
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,948
Then don't tell me that...

333
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,648
Then did you solve the code of my daughter's e-mail?

334
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:49,248
Yes, indeed I have.

335
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:50,548
Hey.

336
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,748
It's dangerous if you fall off!

337
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,048
Dangerous?

338
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,448
So it was a dangerous e-mail after all.

339
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:59,048
I mean, no...

340
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:02,948
She's nowhere close to danger. Rather, she's well brought up.

341
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,848
Well brought up?

342
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,848
Hey, idiot! Stop pulling!

343
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:09,748
You're the one who's pulling and stalling the conversation, Mr. Mouri!

344
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,248
I mean, no...

345
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,748
Please tell me quickly.

346
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:14,548
What are the contents of the mail?

347
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,848
No matter what the contents, I won't be surprised.

348
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,748
I'm fully prepared for what's to come!

349
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:21,148
If I tell my daughter about the contents and ask her about it,

350
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:25,148
I'm sure she will stop sneaking around and tell me what she's up to.

351
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:26,648
So, go on, please tell me.

352
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:31,148
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri!

353
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,848
No, actually I couldn't solve it at all.

354
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,248
What? Just what are you getting at?

355
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:47,448
Besides, I got a request for a big job,

356
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:50,548
and will probably be tied up with that job for a while.

357
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,248
So I'm calling to say that I'd like to decline this request from you.

358
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:54,848
No way.

359
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:57,648
But she is a fine young lady,

360
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:02,248
so I'd advise you not to worry and watch over her!

361
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:04,248
How can you be so sure?

362
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:06,248
You've never even met her.

363
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:12,148
I know from my hunch as a detective.

364
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:15,848
Please give my regards to your daughter.

365
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:21,348
Birthday presents should be kept a surprise after all.

366
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:30,248
That cat maybe didn't need my help.

367
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,948
Are you hungry?

368
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:03,848
Then let's ask Ran to make dinner for you.

369
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:06,148
Dinner?

370
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:07,648
Sundown?

371
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:10,548
Yoko's drama!

372
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:12,548
I not only missed it, I didn't get to tape it either!

373
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:16,848
I forgot all about it because you keep going here and there.

374
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,648
Not only that, but you hid the video tape, too!

375
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,748
-Well... -Hold it.

376
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,548
Just what do you think you're doing to my Goro?

377
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:26,248
Dear.

378
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:29,648
Eri? Aren't you were supposed to be in Okinawa?

379
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:31,248
I was so worried about him,

380
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:37,148
I flew back early and plan to finish the rest of my work via phone and fax.

381
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:38,548
Come, Goro.

382
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,848
It's time to say goodbye to this scary man.

383
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,748
You may both be "Goro", but what a difference.

384
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:47,248
What?

385
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:51,948
Wasn't the other black and brown Goro you had also attached to you?

386
00:23:51,948 --> 00:23:54,448
You're so different when it comes to denseness, too.

387
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:58,648
Don't tell me that Goro...

388
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:01,048
stands for Kogoro's goro?

389
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,700
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
"Key holder"

391
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,620
The next episode will be at Sonoko's villa.

392
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
It's been a long time since we last dealt with Gunma Prefectural Police.
