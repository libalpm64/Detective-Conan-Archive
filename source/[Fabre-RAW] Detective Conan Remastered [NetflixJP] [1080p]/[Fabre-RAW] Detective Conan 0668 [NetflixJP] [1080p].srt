1
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:04,327
Ran and I accompanied

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:08,927
Pops to the wedding eve of Pop's old friend.

3
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,627
Amidst the gala atmosphere,

4
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:14,427
the bride, Hatsune Kamon goes off to the nail salon

5
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,727
to prepare for her wedding.

6
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,627
But two hours later,

7
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:22,001
Hatsune leaving behind the word "Goodbye"

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,527
is found burned to death

9
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:27,327
along with an explosion that occurred in the parking lot.

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,027
At first, it was thought that she had committed suicide

11
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:32,627
but, from Hatsune's fake nail with a piece of skin on it,

12
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:35,027
that was found at the scene,

13
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,427
DNA that was virtually matched that of Mr. Raita Banba,

14
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,727
the groom was found.

15
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:41,827
Mr. Banba denies committing the crime.

16
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:43,327
He claims that the waiter

17
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:45,827
who had secretly been seeing Hatsune is suspicious

18
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,627
but, he turns out to be a detective that was hired by Hatsune.

19
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:52,031
He seems to have been checking on Mr. Banba's daily affairs.

20
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:56,727
His testimony was backed up by the detective that Mr. Banba had hired.

21
00:00:56,727 --> 00:01:01,327
Mr. Banba agrees to go through another DNA test.

22
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,327
The vivid coloured memories of summer.

23
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,427
Solve mysteries all season round.

24
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:12,051
The past of the two tells of everything.

25
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,053
What is the proof that he is not the culprit?

26
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,827
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,057
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,427
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:06,871
"Wedding Eve (Part 2)"

30
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:08,971
Inspector Megure.

31
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,771
There's one door at the back of this restaurant

32
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:15,771
that leads to the parking lot.

33
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:19,871
But, since it was raining hard when the incident occurred,

34
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,771
that door seemed to have been locked.

35
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,171
Which means in order to get out of the restaurant,

36
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,471
there was no other way than to go through the front entrance?

37
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,571
Yes.

38
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:31,871
But if so, I'm sure that one of the guests would've remembered.

39
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,193
Are there no other way in and out of the restaurant?

40
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,471
You could try to make it out of the window of the toilet.

41
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,971
But, outside the window the road is not paved

42
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,201
and there's a big puddle,

43
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,471
so if anyone did pass through here,

44
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:47,871
there should be some traces of footprints left behind.

45
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:51,871
At the time of the incident, it seems to have been windy,

46
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,213
because Hatsune's umbrella was found

47
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,071
blown to the very end of the parking lot.

48
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,571
Wind?

49
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,871
Come to think of it,

50
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,371
when we got to this restaurant it was pretty windy.

51
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:08,671
And? Do you detectives have anything that comes to mind?

52
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:09,871
Not in particular.

53
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:13,071
When I told him that she was secretly seeing some other man,

54
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,071
he was quite out of sorts

55
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,071
but recently it seems that he was more concerned

56
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:20,871
about the fact that she was secretly talking to somebody over the phone.

57
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:25,071
Well, but she was only probably contacting this guy.

58
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:29,871
Oh, no. I contacted her only by mail.

59
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,671
The only time I met her outside was just once,

60
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,371
the time you saw her with me.

61
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:37,971
Only there was just one time when her face clouded.

62
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,671
-Her face clouded? -Yes.

63
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,271
I'm a detective so,

64
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:45,571
I was checking in detail on Banba.

65
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:48,971
Then I found out about something.

66
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,269
Found out about something?

67
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:54,273
He and Hatsune were both rescued from a hotel fire.

68
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:56,571
Although both their identities weren't known,

69
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,271
they were raised in the same church.

70
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,971
Which means that both their parents died in the fire?

71
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:09,071
It seems to have been a pretty big fire with many casualties,

72
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,571
and both of them were babies.

73
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:14,071
Which means they were childhood friends?

74
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:18,771
No, he seems to have been adopted right away

75
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:22,771
but she was raised in church for some time.

76
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,771
But, why did her face cloud because of it?

77
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,971
I wonder...

78
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:29,971
She said that she would check on things herself later.

79
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,671
Ran.

80
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,315
How tall was Hatsune?

81
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,071
She was shorter than you, wasn't she?

82
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,319
Yes.

83
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,323
Besides, she was wearing boots with pretty high heels.

84
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,871
I think she was much shorter than me,

85
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:48,327
like about 5 feet or so.

86
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,771
But why are you asking me something like that?

87
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:56,671
The average height of Japanese women is about 5 feet 3 inches or so.

88
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,271
Inspector Megure!

89
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,371
Did you get results for the DNA test already?

90
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:06,345
No, not yet.

91
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,071
According to forensics,

92
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:10,349
one fake nail is missing from the body.

93
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,871
So, that's the one that was found near the car.

94
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:17,671
No, if that's included, then there are two missing in total.

95
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,671
Then did the remaining one burn in the car to ashes?

96
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:24,771
Or...

97
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,171
Conan.

98
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,171
The place I found the umbrella?

99
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,171
What's asking something like that going to do?

100
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:36,071
Pops Kogoro told me to go and ask you.

101
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:40,071
It was hooked on to this car at the end,

102
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,371
like this...

103
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,671
Hey, you! Kid!

104
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,771
If the fake nail were to have come off,

105
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,171
it may have fallen into the inside of the umbrella

106
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,771
and if it would've been blown away together...

107
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:57,071
Here it is.

108
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,571
Moreover the tire and the body of the car served to rain-proof it,

109
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,571
so it's virtually not soiled at all.

110
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,471
Are the things on the tip of the nail...

111
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,471
skin and blood?

112
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:11,571
Sir, there is a fake nail under this car.

113
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,971
It probably belonged to the lady who died,

114
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:17,671
so can you pick it up carefully?

115
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,671
Please check the things on the tip of the nail very carefully.

116
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:21,671
Yes.

117
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:31,171
I'm sure that this will clarify things of who killed her

118
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,571
and if it's just as I've deducted...

119
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,771
the sad truth that you didn't want to know about

120
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:43,071
will be exposed in broad daylight.

121
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,771
Darn. What the heck is going on anyway?

122
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,971
Darn!

123
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:58,071
Hey. It's about time you really cool it, Banba.

124
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,871
You understand that you're in a grave predicament, don't you?

125
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:04,071
Hatsune burns to death in a car

126
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,465
that is parked in the parking lot of this restaurant,

127
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,771
and on the fake nail that was found near that car,

128
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,971
skin that looked to be like that of the culprit was stuck to it.

129
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,971
The DNA of the skin virtually matched the DNA of your hair

130
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:19,271
that was found on the hairbrush.

131
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,471
Under these circumstances,

132
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,481
it can't be helped if you emerge as the culprit.

133
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:28,171
So now, did you ever let anyone use that hairbrush?

134
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:29,471
Use?

135
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:33,171
Like when a friend spent the night at your house or something.

136
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,493
I wonder...

137
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,771
I don't remember any such time.

138
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:40,871
Hatsune and I have been living together since six months ago.

139
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:43,271
A detective from somewhere that Hatsune invited over

140
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:46,271
may have used it when I wasn't home, though.

141
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:50,509
It's true that I'm a detective that was hired by her

142
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,071
but I never went to your house.

143
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:57,371
I can't really say if that detective thing is for real or not too.

144
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,871
Now that Hatsune's dead,

145
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,071
there's nobody who can prove that.

146
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,871
If that detective was so sharp

147
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:06,525
as to divert the attention of the detective that I hired

148
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,871
so that he got away each time he was tailed,

149
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,529
it would've been easy for him to plant somebody else's hair

150
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,531
on my hairbrush when he came over,

151
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:16,535
and set me up for something I didn't do.

152
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:17,571
Oh, no.

153
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:20,539
I'm not the spy type.

154
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,971
Well, I guess not.

155
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:26,545
I just got a report on the DNA test result.

156
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,371
I has been confirmed that the hair

157
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:32,171
on the hairbrush was unmistakably Mr. Banba's!

158
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,971
No joke...

159
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:34,971
Yes.

160
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:37,671
Which means that...

161
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:40,559
You who mistook me, a detective that was hired by Hatsune,

162
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,971
for her lover,

163
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,271
from feelings of jealousy that aroused

164
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,671
started harboring murderous intent.

165
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,971
Therefore, there's no other option than to think that you waited for her

166
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:50,071
to come back at the parking lot of this restaurant,

167
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,571
shoved her into the car and burned her to death.

168
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,971
Why you...

169
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:56,171
Then,

170
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,577
you will voluntarily come to the station with me?

171
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,579
Wait, I tell you.

172
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,271
Mouri, do something, will you?

173
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,571
There's not much I can do.

174
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,571
-Mouri... -Let's go.

175
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,587
Okay.

176
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:12,171
I re-parked the police car a little distance from here

177
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,171
and since it's raining you may get wet without an umbrella.

178
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,671
It started raining again?

179
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,871
Yes, and pretty hard too.

180
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:20,271
I don't really mind getting wet, though.

181
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,171
No kidding, it's raining hard.

182
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:30,071
Are sure it's okay, Banba?

183
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,171
Really?

184
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,615
Are you sure you want to leave this restaurant?

185
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,471
Even if I don't want to, I've got no choice, do I?

186
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,271
At this rate, I've got to go to the police

187
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:42,621
to have them prove my innocence.

188
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:43,771
I see.

189
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,871
If so, you're not the culprit.

190
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Dad.

191
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,645
Hey, hey, Mr. Mouri.

192
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,300
Although he did agree to going voluntarily to the station,

193
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,700
that doesn't mean that he's not the culprit, does it?

194
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,200
He may be thinking that even if he's interrogated

195
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,600
he won't get caught if he doesn't confess to his crime.

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,500
No way.

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Then please try to recall the circumstances

198
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,800
when Hatsune's car went up in flames.

199
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,300
The door leading to the parking lot from this restaurant

200
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,400
was locked because it was raining.

201
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Going in and out from the toilet window is also unthinkable

202
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,300
because below that window there was a big puddle,

203
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,800
but the culprit's footprints weren't found anywhere near it.

204
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,800
If so, the only way out is through the front entrance of the restaurant.

205
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,100
But, if the main character of today's wedding party leaves the restaurant,

206
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,691
somebody is bound to have seen him, right?

207
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,000
My deduction would be it wasn't that nobody noticed,

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,100
it's just that no one was aware.

209
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,701
Just what do you mean?

210
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,600
He disguised himself in the men's room.

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,700
He had hidden the clothes to carry out his plan,

212
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
in the men's room beforehand.

213
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,100
For example, if he wears a knitted cap

214
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
and long windbreaker,

215
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,100
nobody would notice that it's him.

216
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,900
More so because he greeted everyone at the beginning of the party

217
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,500
and imprinted what he was wearing onto their memory.

218
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Then what about the call I made to Hatsune

219
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
just before the car went up in flames?

220
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,400
Hatsune was crying and saying goodbye, you know?

221
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,300
Did you really call her just before the car went up in flames?

222
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,600
What?

223
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,900
Isn't it a fact that you waited for her in the parking lot in disguise,

224
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,300
and called her after she got out of the car?

225
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,800
You did this so that you could pass her out

226
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,751
while she was distracted by your phone call.

227
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,500
Although she put up a bit of a fight,

228
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,757
you somehow managed to shove her into the car.

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,300
After setting fire to the car,

230
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,100
you rushed back to the restaurant,

231
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,500
and changed into your original clothes in the men's room.

232
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Then later, you deliberately punched me, the waiter, and hurt yourself

233
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,771
in order to hide the place that she scratched you.

234
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:16,200
All you needed to do next was to conspicuously pretend to call her

235
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,800
and make the people around you think that

236
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,779
she was saying what sounded like a suicidal message.

237
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,781
You look out the window

238
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:26,400
and make the others realize that her car is burning.

239
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
This way, you end up being the poor man

240
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,400
who beloved woman committed suicide.

241
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,100
You were lucky that just about that time,

242
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,500
the spray can in the car exploded.

243
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,200
That's all nonsense.

244
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,801
Hatsune really said goodbye to me.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,803
Please check Hatsune's cell phone.

246
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,300
It should be in the car.

247
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,100
We did find a burnt black cell phone.

248
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,200
But, even if we're able to recover the data,

249
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,400
we can't retrieve what kind of conversation you had...

250
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,600
But, if we go by that deduction the clothes

251
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,100
and things that were used for the disguise

252
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,200
should've been found in the toilet.

253
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
He probably shredded it and flushed it down the toilet.

254
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,823
Of course that's possible with a knitted cap.

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,300
As for the flimsy nylon windbreaker, it's easy to shred.

256
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,829
What about the shoes?

257
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,200
You can shred shoes that easily.

258
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,300
There's no need to change shoes.

259
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,400
If you keep on walking without stopping

260
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,300
nobody can tell what kind of shoes you're wearing.

261
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,500
In fact, the shoes he was wearing

262
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,700
was sneakers that are sold everywhere.

263
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,400
Okay, Banba.

264
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,851
Take off your sneakers and show him

265
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
the sole of your sneakers.

266
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,000
That's the proof that'll show that you're not the culprit.

267
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
There is something that looks like cream

268
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,865
in the groove of the sole of his shoe.

269
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,600
What?

270
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,200
I think that's chocolate cake.

271
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,600
Mr. Banba was stepping on the cake that fell to the floor.

272
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,875
When did he step on it?

273
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,879
Before Hatsune left this restaurant to go to the nail salon.

274
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,900
I see.

275
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,885
If he walked in that heavy rain at the time the incident happened,

276
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,900
most of this cream would've come off.

277
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,900
More so, if he rushed back to the restaurant

278
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,100
after committing the crime.

279
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,400
I see.

280
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,300
In other words, he didn't leave the restaurant.

281
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,700
No.

282
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,900
In fact, when I first saw that,

283
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,100
I thought it was foul play that Mr. Banba was putting on.

284
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,100
That he somehow managed to change his shoes

285
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,600
to show me the cream on the sole of his shoe as proof

286
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,400
that he didn't leave the restaurant.

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900
But, he coincidentally stepped on the cake

288
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,100
after that young detective dropped it

289
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,600
and Banba never said a word

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,300
about the cream on the sole of his shoe to me.

291
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,400
And more so, he's about to leave the restaurant in the rain

292
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
and would be getting rid of very important evidence.

293
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,200
That's what convinced me that the cream wasn't fake,

294
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
but rather, evidence that would prove Banba's innocence.

295
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,943
Mouri.

296
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,700
But, what about the DNA?

297
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,500
On the tip of her fake nail was the DNA of a piece of skin

298
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,951
that virtually matched his.

299
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,500
That's only proof that he was near her at that time, is it not?

300
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Didn't it ever dawn on you

301
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,900
that the skin on her fake nail may have been her own?

302
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,300
Just what do you think you're saying?

303
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,500
Like I mentioned earlier,

304
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,965
unless you're blood related,

305
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:30,300
it's impossible that genetic information would virtually match.

306
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Currently, the chances of another person with the same type DNA appearing

307
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,300
is one in 4 trillion 7,000 billion people.

308
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,600
Besides, women don't have the Y chromosome that men have,

309
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,500
so it's readily obvious.

310
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,983
It could be that they said virtually

311
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,985
because the skin in question,

312
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
was contaminated by rain and soil,

313
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,300
making it hard to determine the gender, right?

314
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,700
Even so...

315
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,600
Are you saying that such a twosome coincidentally ran into each other,

316
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,300
fell in love and decided to marry each other?

317
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,400
They may have run into each other coincidentally,

318
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,000
but I think it was inevitable that they were attracted to each other.

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,500
Because they were twins.

320
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,200
Twins?

321
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,200
Banba you guys were saying,

322
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,025
our birthdays are the same,

323
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,400
our blood types are the same,

324
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,700
and that you can tell what the other is thinking at times.

325
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,031
Yes.

326
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,033
But, that's not enough to make us twins.

327
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,600
You may not have known about it,

328
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
but when Hatsune and you were babies,

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,300
both of you were rescued from a hotel fire

330
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,600
and raised at a church with no way to find who you both were.

331
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
A hotel fire?

332
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,051
I see, since your parents burned to death in the fire,

333
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,053
no one knew you were twins.

334
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:59,057
Do twins have the same DNA?

335
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,900
It seems to be so for identical twins,

336
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,061
but, in that case

337
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,800
if I remember it's supposed to be two boys or two girls.

338
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,100
It happens quite rarely.

339
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,071
When the chromosomes of the fertilized egg,

340
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,600
before splitting into two is XY,

341
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,500
in the case of men, during the split,

342
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
the Y chromosome on one side because of some factor is lost,

343
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,900
resulting in XO and XY,

344
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,083
in other words,

345
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:30,300
identical twins of different genders are born.

346
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,400
Hey, hey. You're joking, right?

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,700
That Hatsune and I are twins.

348
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Do you know how tall she was?

349
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,600
She said she was a bit more than 4 feet.

350
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,101
She was bothered about being short.

351
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
If so, the possibility is high.

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
The female side of identical twins of different genders,

353
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,100
because of Turner's syndrome tend to be short.

354
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,000
But...

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,100
why was Hatsune's own skin on her fake nail?

356
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,300
Can't you tell, Banba?

357
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,123
After hearing from the young detective

358
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:08,700
that you and her were rescued from the same fire,

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,000
if she told him, "I'll check further for myself."

360
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,800
Then I can't think of anything else she would do

361
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,500
than to get a DNA analysis to clarify

362
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,400
whether you're both really twins.

363
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,900
It is most likely that when she got back here from the nail salon,

364
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,800
and got off the car,

365
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,600
she got a call from the place that was doing the analysis

366
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,700
and was told the result...

367
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,800
that you and Hatsune could never get married

368
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,500
because you were blood related twins.

369
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,400
No...

370
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,161
No way...

371
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,000
Her skin was probably on the fake nail

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,900
because shocked at the result,

373
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,175
she scratched her face and cried to the point her fake nail came off.

374
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,200
The fake nail that fell inside the umbrella she was holding then,

375
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,900
that was blown away is being checked now.

376
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
Once the result is out I'm sure...

377
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,191
Yes, Megure here.

378
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,195
I see.

379
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
I got it.

380
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Did the result of the other fake nail come out?

381
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,900
Yes, on that fake nail,

382
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
not only was there a blood stain on it,

383
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,700
it was virtually not contaminated at all.

384
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,211
It was a perfect match with Mr. Banba's DNA.

385
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,800
All except for the part that indicates the gender.

386
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,219
It seems to have match with her DNA

387
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,221
that they barely managed to get from her corpse,

388
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,700
so the skin on the fake nail was concluded to be hers too.

389
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Then, she committed suicide after all?

390
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
That's the only thing thinkable.

391
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,900
But that company sure called her at a bad time.

392
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,600
Since they heard that the two were getting married tomorrow,

393
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
they wanted to let them know before it was too late

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,500
and before a fatal mistake was carried out.

395
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,700
Hatsune...

396
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Hatsune!

397
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,257
Hatsune!

398
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Mr. Banba's scream tore through the sound of the rain and echoed.

399
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,273
We can't tell why she chose to burn herself to death,

400
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:41,279
but maybe she wanted to go back in order to do things all over again.

401
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,900
Into the flames that lead them to this tragic destiny.

402
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,371
What? You want to be my disciple?

403
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,200
You mean of this great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

404
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,700
Yes, of course.

405
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,800
I decided I wanted to start from scratch

406
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
when I heard your great deduction the other day

407
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,700
and strongly felt how immature I still was.

408
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,900
That's why I want to work part-time near you

409
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,800
and accompany you on the cases you go to handle.

410
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,500
But I don't take disciples...

411
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:39,397
As tuition...

412
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,700
I don't mind paying I plan to pay you.

413
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,500
No joke?

414
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
You're hired!

415
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
From now on, call me "master", understand, Amuro?

416
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
Master Mouri.

417
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,700
A bit of trouble again.

418
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,423
"Mirror".

420
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,138
The dark tower sort of gives me the chills.

421
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:09,427
Like in the mysteries of ancient times?

422
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,200
Just like your deductions, pops.
