1
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:23,963
Today's stage is a pet shop.

2
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:25,663
Something happens in Tokyo and Gunma.

3
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:27,763
What connects the two incidents?

4
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,163
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,063
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,063
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,643 --> 00:02:00,443
The other day, I found a cute one here.

8
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,743
A pet shop?

9
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,243
A cute one?

10
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:07,443
I wanted to show it to you guys.

11
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:10,043
It looks to be their day off.

12
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,643
True.

13
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:13,043
So, here it is.

14
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:14,143
Huh?

15
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,243
I told them I'd be coming at 10 am, and yet...

16
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:21,443
Hey, it seems like they're opening the shutter.

17
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:22,743
What?

18
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,243
Yeah.

19
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:30,643
Excuse me! My name is Ninomiya.

20
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,643
Is anybody in?

21
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:45,843
There he is! He's the one! This one!

22
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:49,443
-What? -Genta, you mean this?

23
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:50,943
Yeah.

24
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:53,843
How ugly!

25
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,443
What's this sound?

26
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,743
Maybe something got away, like a snake or something.

27
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,043
What?

28
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,843
-Snake! -Snake!

29
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,743
It's a beetle!

30
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:10,143
I got it.

31
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:13,043
Why is a beetle in a place like this?

32
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,843
Furthermore, at this time of season.

33
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:32,943
What?

34
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:34,043
What's up, Conan?

35
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:36,743
-What is it? -Talk about messy.

36
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,243
Stay away!

37
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:46,443
"Mysterious Spring Beetle"

38
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:51,543
The victim is the owner of the pet shop, Mr. Minoru Shirai, age 41.

39
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,743
There are traces of strangulation.

40
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,043
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet.

41
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:58,043
Yes, sir. Okay.

42
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,443
There were traces of him having been strangled

43
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:04,243
with a thin thread-like thing.

44
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,043
He seems to have been killed elsewhere

45
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:09,643
then brought here.

46
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:11,343
How can you tell?

47
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:13,943
If he died here, his legs should be stretched straight

48
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:16,543
due to postmortem stiffening.

49
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:17,643
I see.

50
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,343
Mr. Ninomiya.

51
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:23,143
You were scheduled to come here at 10 am?

52
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:26,843
Yes. I was told to call the shop at 6 pm last night

53
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:31,243
to check if it came in or not, so I called.

54
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:33,843
Did you notice anything strange back then?

55
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:37,843
Nothing in particular, except for that frog croaking.

56
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:39,543
Croaking?

57
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,743
Hey, what were you planning on buying?

58
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:47,043
What? Oh, a beetle.

59
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:48,643
A beetle?

60
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:50,743
You mean they sell it in this season?

61
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:53,543
Yes. I was told something about a place in Gunma

62
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,043
where you can get beetles all year round.

63
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,343
Gunma?

64
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:01,943
Please tell me where were you yesterday?

65
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,643
I was sleeping till noon and from 3 pm to 10 pm,

66
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:06,343
I was working at a family restaurant.

67
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,643
Beetle?

68
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,443
What's that?

69
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:14,943
This is it!

70
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:18,743
Yes! Mr. Shirai probably went here.

71
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:20,843
Gunma...

72
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:25,343
Officer Sato, we found this in the victim's pocket.

73
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,643
-There was nothing more inside? -No, madam.

74
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,643
Where's the lid?

75
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:30,843
The thing is, we can't find it.

76
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:33,543
But why would something like this be here?

77
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:37,643
Hey, stay still!

78
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,343
Hey! What's that?

79
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,743
Isn't that a beetle?

80
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:44,643
I found it walking there a while ago.

81
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:45,743
Big, isn't it?

82
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,843
How dare you all just come in like that?

83
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:49,243
Go on home!

84
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,243
We're sorry!

85
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,643
Gosh. If she chases us out,

86
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,643
we won't be able to investigate, you know.

87
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:00,743
Sorry, sorry, but...

88
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,543
See? Here's the flyer that Conan was looking at a while ago.

89
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,043
I guess we can go to...

90
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:07,943
The insect pavilion in Gunma for now.

91
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:10,043
Let's go!

92
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:13,543
But, how do we get there?

93
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,143
That's true.

94
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,943
You guys...

95
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,243
Hi there, kids!

96
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:24,243
-Officer... -Takagi.

97
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,943
Huh?

98
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:33,843
What's with all of you?

99
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,343
Hurry, Officer Takagi!

100
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:36,843
Hurry, to where?

101
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,443
We've found a clue!

102
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,443
-What? -Hurry, hurry!

103
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,443
Where do you want me to go?

104
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,443
Straight! Straight ahead!

105
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,443
What?

106
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:48,143
Straight...

107
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,543
Hey, it's dangerous! Keep your eye on the road!

108
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,143
Yeah. But straight ahead is...

109
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,743
the expressway.

110
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,443
Hey, hey. Where are we headed for?

111
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:02,043
Isn't it about time you guys tell me?

112
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:06,043
You'll be surprised out of your wits.

113
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:08,643
To the Gunma Insect Museum!

114
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:11,643
Let's see what's on today.

115
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,743
Gunma Insect museum...

116
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:16,443
I see, a museum.

117
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:19,243
What? Gunma!

118
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:21,543
Gosh! You gotta be kidding!

119
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:23,343
We're heading back! We're going home!

120
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,643
But...

121
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:29,943
So, there was such an incident.

122
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,443
Then, the more so, we've got to head back and investigate.

123
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:35,643
But we've already come a long way.

124
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,643
Isn't it almost Gunma?

125
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:40,343
Well, no problem is there? It's your day off, right?

126
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,443
But...

127
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,943
Isn't it a bit cold?

128
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,643
I'm sorry. This car doesn't have a heater.

129
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:51,043
What? I didn't know such a car existed in this day and age.

130
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:53,543
-Junk. -Well, I'm so sorry!

131
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,343
Huh? Don't tell me that, you're who I think you are,

132
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,643
but don't tell me it's you, Conan?

133
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:05,543
Officer klutz of the Gunma Prefectural Police Department.

134
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,643
He's...

135
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:10,043
The officer that goofed and let a murderer get away some time ago.

136
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:12,143
You know what...

137
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:16,643
Mr. Mouri is not with you today?

138
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,543
Nope.

139
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:20,443
That's too bad. If Mr. Mouri were here,

140
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:24,443
we could've maybe seen the Sleeping Kogoro deduction show.

141
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,643
Well, but I guess a mere beetle theft

142
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:32,443
doesn't warrant an appearance from the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

143
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,543
Beetle theft?

144
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:41,843
Is this the truck that was stolen?

145
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:44,043
Yes, sir. No mistake.

146
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,443
The beetle...

147
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:51,943
Isn't there a beetle there?

148
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:54,243
The thief probably took it away

149
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,643
with another car that he had prepared here.

150
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:03,543
Gosh, that's too much! Who would do this?

151
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,743
When was it stolen?

152
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:08,043
About 7 pm last night.

153
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:10,743
This is Mr. Araki of this museum here,

154
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:13,143
and he is beetle researcher, Mr. Haruna.

155
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:15,343
After loading the beetles onto the truck,

156
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:18,343
they went into the museum for a brief moment, and it was during this time,

157
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:21,843
somebody stole their truck from them.

158
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,243
I didn't think that yesterday after I went home,

159
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:27,843
the precious beetles would be stolen.

160
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:31,543
He is the editor of an insect magazine, Mr. Ishida.

161
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:32,743
"Takashi Ishida (25)"

162
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:39,143
I'm sure glad that at least the truck came back.

163
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,343
Mr. Haruna, let's deliver the beetles

164
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:43,543
we promised to the children once again.

165
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,043
Yeah, let's do that.

166
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:49,843
Why do you have beetles at this museum even if it's not summer?

167
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:51,943
Mr. Haruna succeeded in finding a way

168
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:54,943
to make them emerge into adults all year round.

169
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,143
The larva that has been preserved

170
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,843
at 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C is put into another container

171
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:03,343
and the temperature is raised to 28 degrees C.

172
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,743
Then the larva starts to grow.

173
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:09,443
Adjusting the temperature is crucial.

174
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,743
But, isn't it cold when you transport them by truck?

175
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:14,843
That's nothing to worry about.

176
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:17,243
This truck is equipped with an air conditioner

177
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:20,343
in order to enable temperature adjustment.

178
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:22,243
When we transport adult beetles,

179
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,943
we keep the temperature at 28 degrees C.

180
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:28,743
The beetles are "richer" than you, Officer Takagi.

181
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,443
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:33,343
Conan, could it be that the beetle

183
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,943
that we saw back at Mr. Shirai's place was also...

184
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,243
Huh? Mr. Shirai?

185
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:40,543
Mr. Shirai of the pet shop. Do you know him?

186
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,943
Yes. He came to ask us to sell him a beetle.

187
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,643
He was extremely persistent.

188
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,743
All that man is ever concerned about is money.

189
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:52,643
I didn't continue my research on beetles all this time for money.

190
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:55,343
Did Mr. Shirai do something?

191
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:57,843
Don't tell me he's the one who stole it?

192
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:03,643
No. Well, this morning, he was found killed at his shop in Tokyo.

193
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,143
-Huh? -Killed?

194
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:09,343
But if he was killed in Tokyo,

195
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:11,443
why did you all come out to a place like this?

196
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,643
Oh, well...

197
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,643
Where were all of you last night?

198
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,543
You mean we're under suspicion?

199
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,043
No! This is just to be on the safe side.

200
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:25,143
I contacted the police and had them come right away

201
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,343
so I couldn't have murdered Mr. Shirai.

202
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:32,343
I was looking all night for the truck,

203
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,143
but ended up finding nothing after all.

204
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:37,143
-All by yourself? -Yes, sir.

205
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,743
I was doing some interviews until 6 pm yesterday,

206
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,143
and then returned to Tokyo.

207
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:45,743
I had appointments for a continuation for an interview today too,

208
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,543
but I'm not involved

209
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:52,243
because I don't even know this Mr. Shirai at all.

210
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,443
Did you find something?

211
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:57,443
Soil?

212
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:59,743
Yeah, that's hum.

213
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,043
Hum?

214
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,543
It's used to raise larva.

215
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,343
That's...

216
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:09,543
It looks like the lid of something.

217
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:12,143
No, no! Don't touch it!

218
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,143
What happened?

219
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,843
I wonder if this was here before?

220
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,143
I don't think so.

221
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,943
Mr. Shirai was transported on this truck.

222
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,443
Officer Takagi?

223
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,743
Yes!

224
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:43,843
Officer Sato?

225
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,643
What brings you here?

226
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:49,143
Well...

227
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:54,343
All of you!

228
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,443
We beat you to it.

229
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,343
I want to keep a beetle, too!

230
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,843
If you want one, I'll give you one.

231
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:12,043
What? Really?

232
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:16,143
But you've got to raise it so that it lives as long as it can.

233
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:19,943
Why do you think we're researching beetles?

234
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,643
That's because through getting to know beetles,

235
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:25,943
we want to relay to everyone the importance of life.

236
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,343
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:33,943
Your cell phone doesn't have a strap, does it?

238
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,943
Huh? What happened to your museum strap?

239
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,843
You had it hanging around your neck yesterday.

240
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:43,443
I gave it to a child of my acquaintance.

241
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:46,243
You mean there's a strap of the insect museum?

242
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,043
Yeah. Would you all like one, too?

243
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:51,643
Yes, we'd like one, for sure!

244
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,143
Well, well, what a surprise!

245
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:58,943
To think that a mere insect theft

246
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:02,343
may be connected to a murder case.

247
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:06,043
Just a minute! He is not a "mere" insect theft!

248
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:07,643
I'm sorry. My tongue sort of slipped.

249
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:11,643
Officer Sato. When was Mr. Shirai murdered?

250
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:16,343
The estimated time of death was between 9 pm to 10 pm.

251
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,943
-Right, Officer Sato? -Yes.

252
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,043
I just found out a while ago.

253
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:24,443
Between 9 pm to 10 pm...

254
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,343
And this morning at about 5 am,

255
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,643
the sound of the shutter of the pet shop being opened

256
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:29,943
seems to have been heard.

257
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:32,843
5 am? Strange.

258
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:35,743
If he was murdered between 9 pm to 10 pm,

259
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,443
why would such a sound be heard at that hour?

260
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,643
Could it be Mr. Shirai's ghost?

261
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:42,843
Considering his time of death,

262
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:46,843
his body temperature was greatly decreased.

263
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,743
I see. So, that's the story.

264
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:54,443
That's why the killer waited until daybreak

265
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:57,143
to transport the corpse that he had on him.

266
00:14:57,143 --> 00:15:00,743
Which means that the killer is among the three.

267
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,197
Straps!

268
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,997
-Look, look. -See? Great, isn't it?

269
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,997
I got one, too!

270
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:13,197
Hey, hey.

271
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,397
Here! This is yours, Conan.

272
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:19,597
Thank you.

273
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:22,197
-We all have one. -Yeah.

274
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:25,997
According to my deduction,

275
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:29,397
I think that the one who killed Mr. Shirai is Mr. Haruna.

276
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:30,797
What?

277
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,297
Mr. Haruna. After the truck was stolen,

278
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,997
you said you were driving around looking for it, didn't you?

279
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,797
But...

280
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:41,897
Back then! You found Mr. Shirai.

281
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:44,297
You took revenge on him for stealing your beetles and...

282
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:51,497
Wrong! It's not Mr. Haruna!

283
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:52,997
Right, right!

284
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:58,297
Mr. Haruna is researching beetles to relay the importance of life,

285
00:15:58,297 --> 00:16:00,197
so he would never do something like that!

286
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:01,797
Right!

287
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,097
Well...

288
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:18,497
You do know what's going on, don't you?

289
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:21,097
Just as would be expected of members of the Youth Detective Squad.

290
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,697
If so, who is the real killer?

291
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,697
What is going on with him?

292
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:28,897
We'll leave that aside for a while

293
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:32,197
and think about the theft first.

294
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:34,397
The one who stole the truck with the beetles in it

295
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:37,297
was Mr. Shirai, who was killed.

296
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,197
But according to what Mr. Ninomiya,

297
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,997
the one who was the first to find Mr. Shirai says,

298
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:43,897
Mr. Shirai was at his shop at 6 pm.

299
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,197
The truck was stolen at 7 pm.

300
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:49,397
Wouldn't it have been impossible for Mr. Shirai to steal it?

301
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:54,997
No. Mr. Shirai used Mr. Ninomiya to make up his alibi.

302
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,497
He told Mr. Ninomiya to call him at 6 pm,

303
00:16:57,497 --> 00:17:00,097
then had the call transferred to his cell phone.

304
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:02,597
He then made Mr. Ninomiya hear

305
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:05,097
the croaking of the frog that he had in the bottle,

306
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:06,597
saying that it's the croaking of the frog

307
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:09,297
that he is selling at his shop or something to that effect.

308
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:11,897
Then, I'll see you tomorrow at 10 am.

309
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,197
That's why Mr. Ninomiya thought that

310
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:19,197
Mr. Shirai was at the shop yesterday.

311
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:22,797
Besides, he did see the frog in the shop this morning, too.

312
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:27,997
However, the one who stole the beetles was not Mr. Shirai alone.

313
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,297
What?

314
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:35,197
On the way transporting the beetles, Mr. Shirai and the other thief

315
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,797
for some reason got into an argument.

316
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:45,597
At that time, the killer whose cell phone strap was cut

317
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,097
strangled Mr. Shirai with that strap

318
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,897
and killed him.

319
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,097
I'm sure that the fingerprints of Mr. Shirai

320
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,997
are on the killer's cell phone.

321
00:17:56,997 --> 00:18:00,297
If he didn't wipe them off himself, that is.

322
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,497
The killer after killing Mr. Shirai figured

323
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,897
that he would make it look as if the shop had been robbed,

324
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:10,297
and took the body to the shop at 5:00 in the morning,

325
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,697
because he heard Mr. Shirai tell Mr. Ninomiya

326
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:15,597
that he would be at the shop.

327
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,697
The killer decided to use Mr. Shirai's alibi trick

328
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,097
to his own advantage.

329
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:24,597
But why did he move the body at daybreak?

330
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:27,597
Where was the body for 7 to 8 hours before that?

331
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,997
In the truck that we just saw!

332
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:34,697
There was a lot of hum spilled all over the bed of the truck,

333
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,597
and a lot of that hum was attached to Mr. Shirai's hair.

334
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,197
Besides, the lid of the bottle that was in the victim's pocket

335
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:43,697
was found on the bed of the truck.

336
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:48,597
The bed of the truck is made so that the temperature can be adjusted.

337
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:52,097
After unloading the beetles, the killer turned on the cooler

338
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,597
and set the temperature to winter temperature.

339
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:57,297
Under normal conditions, the temperature of dead bodies decreases

340
00:18:57,297 --> 00:19:00,597
at a rate of about one degree C an hour.

341
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,397
But if the body is left in winter temperature,

342
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:05,897
the temperature will go down faster than usual.

343
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:08,097
By doing so, the killer was able to make it look as if

344
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:11,397
the estimated time of death was as early as 6 pm.

345
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:16,197
That's why something about the temperature of the corpse was unnatural.

346
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,997
Yes, then he messed the room up

347
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,397
to make it look as if a robbery took place.

348
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:24,797
If it looks as if Mr. Shirai was killed at his shop in Tokyo

349
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:28,897
and the killer gets back to Gunma by 6 pm,

350
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:32,897
he figured he would've created an alibi for himself.

351
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:37,197
But the estimated time of death between 9 pm to 10 pm

352
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:40,497
was figured out on a basis other than the body temperature.

353
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,697
How dare you make light of the police?

354
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:46,597
And the killer who had promised to come here today

355
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:49,497
drove the truck and abandoned it in the mountains

356
00:19:49,497 --> 00:19:51,697
where it was found a while ago.

357
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,797
Which means...

358
00:19:56,897 --> 00:20:01,597
Mr. Ishida, you knew Mr. Shirai, didn't you?

359
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:04,097
No...

360
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:07,197
When Mr. Ninomiya came to Mr. Shirai's shop,

361
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,797
he seems to have used the map that was in the magazine

362
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:12,597
that you work as editor for to find his way.

363
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,497
Oh, another person...

364
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,697
Someone else was in charge of it.

365
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:20,297
The mail that you got just a while ago...

366
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,897
Wasn't it from one of your clients, Mr. Ishida?

367
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:25,297
"Sold out of males."

368
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:28,497
I heard that this is what you wrote in your reply.

369
00:20:28,497 --> 00:20:30,097
I was able to read the kanji characters.

370
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,397
It was written "Sold out".

371
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,197
You conspired with Mr. Shirai and stole the beetles!

372
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:40,197
Furthermore, you killed him!

373
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,097
The cell phone strap.

374
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:47,497
The same one as this was also on your cell phone yesterday, wasn't it?

375
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,597
I'm pretty sure that it will match

376
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:52,497
with the traces left on Mr. Shirai's neck.

377
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:55,297
This strap!

378
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,897
Mr. Shirai seems to have pulled extremely hard.

379
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,497
Because the same traces of the strap

380
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,897
that was found on the late Mr. Shirai's neck

381
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:06,497
is also in view on the back of your neck, too.

382
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:10,397
Mr. Ishida.

383
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,797
That jerk!

384
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:18,797
Well, I guess you get 10% of the total this time.

385
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:22,297
Because you virtually did nothing.

386
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:23,597
What?

387
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:26,797
All you ever do is follow me from behind.

388
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:29,897
You're lucky that I even give you a share each time.

389
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,297
You gotta be grateful, man.

390
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:34,297
What'd you say?

391
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:38,297
All he ever did was look down on me!

392
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,797
Comfortable! Really comfortable!

393
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:14,097
This is the way cars should be!

394
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:16,097
Officer Sato.

395
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,997
If you're planning to date Officer Takagi,

396
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,497
I'd advise you not to go driving.

397
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:23,397
Huh?

398
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:24,497
Why do you say that?

399
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:31,397
Shoots. Nobody's riding with me.

400
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,997
Huh?

401
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,597
Why are you in here?

402
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:40,097
Where on earth am I headed?

403
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:42,097
I'm going back to Tokyo!

404
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:43,297
What?

405
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,497
-Hey, stop! Please let me off! -No, I can't!

406
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:48,497
-Let me off! -We're on the freeway!

407
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:51,797
Huh? I wonder what's going on with Officer Takagi?

408
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,397
How dangerous!

409
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,297
I wonder what Officer Takagi's doing anyway.

410
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:57,697
Maybe he just wants attention.

411
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,797
Drive safely, man.

412
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:34,424
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:36,124
"Desk"

414
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:37,124
The next episode is a ghost story.

415
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:38,624
-The science room. -The mirror in the corridor.

416
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:40,324
Hanako!
