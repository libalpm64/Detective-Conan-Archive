1
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:04,295
What exactly does that mean?

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,987
"Sunday" -To have constructed an aquarium in the house?

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,991
Mr. Nishida is a famous aquarium designer

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,395
so maybe he has a huge fish tank in his house.

5
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,595
Aku... akurimu?

6
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,395
Then, does that mean it's a new type of ice cream?

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,003
It's "a-ku-a-ri-u-mu". It means aquarium.

8
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,595
An architect who designs aquariums.

9
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,011
The house of a person who makes aquariums?

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,595
I wonder what the house will be like!

11
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:35,095
I'm nervous!

12
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,035
Brooding over passing seasons

13
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,695
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

14
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,395
Even the fish are freaked out

15
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,495
in the house with an aquarium.

16
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,195
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,195
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,395
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:31,696
"The House with an Aquarium".

20
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:39,496
"Nishida, Aquarium Design Office"

21
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,143
Maybe he isn't home?

22
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:45,922
That's strange.

23
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:49,422
We definitely agreed on 12:00.

24
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,822
Dr. Agasa?

25
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,122
Mr. Imura.

26
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:58,722
"Kousuke Imura (32), Nishida's Assistant" -It's been a while.

27
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:02,722
Oh, is Nishida not in?

28
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:08,167
He promised to show me the interior of his house today.

29
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,622
So that's why the kids are here too?

30
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:11,722
Good afternoon.

31
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:14,173
I'm Nishida's assistant, Imura.

32
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,522
Hello...

33
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:21,122
Nishida probably went out to buy something.

34
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,622
Here, I'll get us in with the spare key.

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,187
Here, come in.

36
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,622
Thank you, Mr. Imura.

37
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:32,191
By the way, your clothes...

38
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,622
Did you come back from a trip somewhere?

39
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:36,722
I went to tour Guam.

40
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:38,922
I left there last night.

41
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:42,201
I arrived in Narita just this morning.

42
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,922
I'm a little behind on sleep.

43
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,217
Awesome.

44
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,622
This is fantastic!

45
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,622
A pirate ship!

46
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:14,233
This fish has a pointy mouth!

47
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,422
That's the Caribbean Longsnout,

48
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:20,222
it's part of the family of butterflyfish who lives in the Caribbean Sea.

49
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,322
Caribbean Sea?

50
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:24,922
What's this?

51
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:28,922
There's a fish with weird markings on it.

52
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:31,922
That's a species of pufferfish that live in the Indian Ocean.

53
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,822
I wonder if there are Indian eels.

54
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:38,257
So pretty!

55
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:45,422
There are really rare! Black clownfish!

56
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:47,922
Those are from Australia.

57
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,922
Look at that, Ai. All the pretty fish!

58
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:55,922
Yeah, just like jewels.

59
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:58,277
You're romantic for a change.

60
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,722
I wonder how much electric bill per month is spent

61
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,222
on just the aquariums.

62
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,222
They're certainly living jewels, aren't they?

63
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,622
Come on.

64
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:10,289
Hey, there isn't anything in that tank.

65
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:11,822
Oh, no!

66
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,222
Genta, what happened?

67
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:19,422
The roof came off!

68
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,022
Give me a break.

69
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:51,422
This glue doesn't dry easily,

70
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:53,522
so don't touch the miniature.

71
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,922
All right.

72
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,922
That's right!

73
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:03,322
Chocolates from Guam, anyone?

74
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,722
Gum chocolate? What's that?

75
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:07,422
It's Guam, Gu-a-m.

76
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,322
Me, I want some!

77
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,722
Before that, wash your hands.

78
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,322
Yes...

79
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:16,922
This is spacious!

80
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:18,822
How nice.

81
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:26,622
What was that?

82
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,922
Hey, what happened?

83
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,022
Conan...

84
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:36,375
Ni... Nishida?

85
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,377
Master!

86
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,379
No... no way!

87
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:44,722
Are you two all right?

88
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,022
Yes.

89
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:49,122
Mr. Imura, hurry, call an ambulance!

90
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,122
Yes.

91
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,393
It's regrettable,

92
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,395
but he's already gone.

93
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,122
It's best to call the police as well.

94
00:06:58,122 --> 00:07:00,122
What?

95
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,522
This person

96
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,403
has a mark like an insect bite on the nape of his neck.

97
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,405
What exactly...

98
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:10,409
What's that?

99
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:15,422
You can't stay here.

100
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:16,922
Just a little...

101
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:20,822
Come, let's go.

102
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,122
No! Just a second!

103
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,822
In short, at 12:30 pm today,

104
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,422
you discovered Nishida's body

105
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,022
submerged in the bathtub, right?

106
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,122
That's correct.

107
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,722
What's the condition of the body?

108
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,222
There are no conspicuous external wounds,

109
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,322
and the cause of death is drowning.

110
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,622
Judging from the extent of the rigor mortis,

111
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:48,447
Mr. Nishida most likely passed away Friday night.

112
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:51,722
With today being Sunday,

113
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,722
that gives us two days.

114
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:58,457
There's a bottle brandy and a glass on the work desk.

115
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,622
He took a bath after drinking?

116
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,422
As he was drunk,

117
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,822
he probably fell asleep while bathing

118
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:07,922
and drowned.

119
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,322
I suppose so.

120
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,422
Mr. Nishida is a strange person, isn't he?

121
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,122
What?

122
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,822
Well, Mr. Nishida took bath at night, didn't he?

123
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,477
But he didn't even turn on the light

124
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,822
and bathed in complete darkness.

125
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:23,322
You are right.

126
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:25,922
If he took a bath on Friday night,

127
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,022
the light should have been on, but...

128
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,222
Hold on!

129
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:32,022
Say, don't you think this is strange too?

130
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:35,422
That's glue on his fingertip, isn't it?

131
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,322
It looks that way.

132
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,522
Wait! Conan!

133
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,505
Applying glue onto miniatures,

134
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,122
is a very delicate task

135
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:50,509
that requires using needles of a syringe.

136
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,522
It's amazing that Mr. Nishida had complete control of his hands.

137
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:57,022
Normally, when one is drunk,

138
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:00,022
it would be impossible to do something this demanding.

139
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:03,322
We should have forensics determine

140
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:07,322
exactly how drunk Mr. Nishida was when he died.

141
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,022
Yes, sir!

142
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,822
Could you conduct the test to determine

143
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:12,531
the level of alcohol content in his blood first?

144
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:13,722
Roger, sir!

145
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:18,537
Also, confirm Mr. Imura's alibi since he has a spare key.

146
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,522
Understood.

147
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:23,922
My apologies,

148
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:28,547
but could you tell us where you were Friday night?

149
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,922
Isn't it an accident?

150
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:33,222
This is merely a formality.

151
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:38,557
I was on an overseas trip to Guam on Friday night.

152
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:42,561
I was shooting on both Friday and Saturday night, so...

153
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,222
The shooting range should have a record of it.

154
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:48,567
Incidentally, when did this trip start and end?

155
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,922
I left on Thursday night

156
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,722
and returned to Narita this morning.

157
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:59,022
I believe you can confirm that with my passport.

158
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:03,222
-Here it is. -Excuse me.

159
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:10,122
I see you left Guam on Saturday night.

160
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:11,922
Thank you for your cooperation.

161
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:13,422
You're not supposed to touch!

162
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,022
I thought it should be dry by now.

163
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:19,522
Geez, Genta.

164
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:23,722
Hey, hey. He said the glue didn't dry easily, didn't he?

165
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:26,605
I wonder how long it'll take to dry.

166
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:31,722
Well, this is a special type that can dry in water,

167
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:35,722
so it'd probably take about 12 hours or so to completely dry.

168
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,322
12 hours?

169
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:42,621
The glue on the body's fingertips wasn't dry yet.

170
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:46,625
If Mr. Nishida died on Friday night,

171
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:50,322
it is strange that the glue hasn't dried.

172
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:52,422
Conan, this is bad!

173
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:54,322
What is it, Ayumi?

174
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,122
All the shrimps are dead.

175
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,322
What?

176
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,639
I thought they weren't keeping anything in this tank.

177
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,645
The shrimps are there to control the water quality.

178
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,622
I wonder why they're dead.

179
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:13,322
The shrimps here are a different species from the ones over there.

180
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:16,122
The lower part of their legs is white.

181
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:19,922
The water quality and environment of every tank seems to be different

182
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:22,661
so the species are probably placed in them accordingly.

183
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:32,122
Could it be...

184
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:34,673
Ayumi!

185
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,322
There are live baby jellyfish!

186
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,679
It's true! Baby jellyfish!

187
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,722
Jellyfish?

188
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:00,222
I see, so that's how it was.

189
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,922
This wasn't an accident,

190
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:06,705
but an ingeniously planned murder!

191
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,711
Inspector.

192
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,578
The blood test report is in.

193
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:20,978
The alcohol content in Mr. Nishida's blood was 0.40%.

194
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:23,878
0.40%?

195
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:28,178
Usually, that's the state bordering unconsciousness.

196
00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:33,078
The fingerprints found on the glass matched Mr. Nishida's.

197
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:35,078
With this, we can conclude that we were right.

198
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:39,378
Mr. Nishida went to bathe even after he became drunk

199
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:41,278
and eventually drowned.

200
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,578
An accident due to carelessness.

201
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,743
I suppose so.

202
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:49,978
That's why I advised him not to drink so much.

203
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,478
Hold on!

204
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:57,078
Mr. Nishida didn't drink any alcohol before he died.

205
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,757
-What? -What?

206
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,759
On the nape of Mr. Nishida's neck,

207
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,278
there's a small spot that resembles an insect bite, isn't there?

208
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,678
That's the mark left behind from an injection.

209
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:09,478
First, the culprit,

210
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:13,778
snuck up on Mr. Nishida, who was working on the miniature.

211
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:17,578
He used chemicals to put Mr. Nishida to sleep.

212
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:22,078
Afterwards, he used the syringe,

213
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,578
and injected the alcohol directly into his blood-stream

214
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,678
through the nape of Mr. Nishida's neck.

215
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,791
In this way, alcohol would be detected in the body's blood,

216
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,795
and it would look as if Mr. Nishida was wasted from alcohol and died.

217
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,799
Afterwards, the culprit submerged the unconscious Mr. Nishida

218
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,178
in the bathtub and drowned him.

219
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,478
Isn't that so?

220
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:48,578
Mr. Imura!

221
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,478
What about me?

222
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,178
Confess.

223
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:59,178
I already know you're the culprit who killed Mr. Nishida.

224
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:03,578
I was in Guam on Friday night when Mr. Nishida died.

225
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:04,823
No, that's false.

226
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:08,827
Mr. Nishida wasn't killed on Friday night.

227
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:13,278
It was probably on Thursday,

228
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,778
the day, before you left for Guam.

229
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:19,378
That's why the bathroom light wasn't on.

230
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:22,841
Sunlight was already flooding in through the large windows.

231
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,078
That caused you to simply forget to switch on the light, didn't it?

232
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:27,878
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:32,578
Didn't the police say Mr. Nishida's time of death was Friday night?

234
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:34,853
That's where your trick comes in.

235
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:38,857
You cooled the body to delay the time of death, didn't you?

236
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,178
Cooled the body?

237
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:44,378
The glue on the body's fingertips

238
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,865
had yet to dry, hadn't it?

239
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:47,978
It's because under low temperatures,

240
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:50,869
it's difficult for the glue to dry.

241
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,878
Since the body was cooled,

242
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:56,278
the glue couldn't dry.

243
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,877
It... it's true that the time of death

244
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,878
can be delayed by cooling the body,

245
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:04,883
but how do you cool the body?

246
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,678
Before I explain the method,

247
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:11,278
I have to first explain the tanks in this house.

248
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,891
Tanks?

249
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:18,897
Now, a question for the kids.

250
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,178
In the tank with the pirate ship miniature,

251
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:28,907
there was Caribbean Longsnout from the Caribbean Sea.

252
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,378
Do you know why?

253
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,178
Why?

254
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:36,278
As for the tank with the pufferfish from the Indian Ocean,

255
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:40,578
why was the miniature of the Taj Mahal placed there?

256
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:41,978
I see.

257
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:44,923
The ocean that the fish is from in the tank

258
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,678
is represented by the miniature inside.

259
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,178
I see!

260
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:51,478
There was a movie that told

261
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:53,578
the story of pirates in the Caribbean sea, wasn't there?

262
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,878
That's why the tank with the pirate ship

263
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:58,578
has fish from the Caribbean sea!

264
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:02,178
The Taj Mahal is a famous temple in India!

265
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:05,478
That means fish from the India Ocean are kept in that tank, right?

266
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:09,478
Then, the tank with the pyramid has fish from the desert?

267
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:10,949
Not quite.

268
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,678
Those fish are likely from the Red Sea, which is in Egypt.

269
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:18,078
The Opera House is a building in Australia,

270
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,959
so that's the tank for fish from Australia!

271
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,278
That's right.

272
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,978
And the miniature that was supposed to be placed in this tank is

273
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,978
that clock tower from Sapporo!

274
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:32,578
Sapporo?

275
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:35,878
In other words, the fish that was supposed to be kept in the tank,

276
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,578
were not tropical fish,

277
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:39,478
but instead, fish from the sea around Hokkaido,

278
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:42,278
probably those from the Sea of Okhotsk!

279
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:43,978
I see.

280
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:48,987
But how exactly is that related to the case?

281
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,778
Try touching the glass of the tank.

282
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:59,778
-It's cold! -Like ice.

283
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:05,778
The Sea of Okhotsk is a cold sea in the north.

284
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:08,078
To house the fish that come from there,

285
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,978
it's necessary to keep the temperature low.

286
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,778
In other words, there should be

287
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:17,778
a cooler in that tank to lower the water temperature.

288
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,021
This... this should be it, right?

289
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:25,778
Mr. Imura used the cooler

290
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,678
to cool the water in the bathtub,

291
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:29,578
so as to keep the body's temperature low,

292
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:32,678
hence delaying the estimated time of death.

293
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,278
-What'd you say? -What'd you say?

294
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:37,035
Look carefully inside the tank.

295
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:41,039
There's evidence showing that the cooler was used to cool the body.

296
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:46,578
Could they be...

297
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:49,047
Contact lens?

298
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,678
Yes, that would be Mr. Nishida's contact lens.

299
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:57,055
The contact lens case in the washroom is empty.

300
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:01,478
As for why the contact lens would be in the tank,

301
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:05,063
it's probably because Mr. Imura, who returned from Guam this morning,

302
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:09,067
came to this house before we arrived.

303
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,069
This is because he had to put the cooler,

304
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:15,478
which had been used to cool the body, back into the original tank.

305
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:19,077
However, on the cooler bar that was in the bathtub,

306
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,078
the contact lens that had dropped out

307
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:24,278
from Mr. Nishida's eye was stuck on it.

308
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:28,878
Not noticing it, Mr. Imura returned the cooler to the tank.

309
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:32,178
Hence the contact lens that was stuck on the bar

310
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,378
fell into the tank.

311
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:38,478
All the shrimp in that tank died

312
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:41,099
because you took away the cooler

313
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,101
and allowed the water temperature to rise.

314
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:46,278
Shrimp are highly susceptible to changes in water temperature.

315
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,578
I didn't come to the house this morning!

316
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,778
I came in for the first time with you, Doctor,

317
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:53,111
when I met you at the door.

318
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,578
Do you remember the newspaper, Mr. Imura?

319
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,178
Newspaper?

320
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:02,378
When you saw the mailbox full of newspapers,

321
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:05,123
you didn't appear to be very surprised at all.

322
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,278
That's because you knew that Mr. Nishida was dead, right?

323
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:15,133
You acted as though you met us at the door by coincidence,

324
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,878
and let us in to discover the body.

325
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:21,139
That's absurd!

326
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,478
That's just your wild guess!

327
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:24,878
There isn't any evidence!

328
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:27,678
Well, let's show you the evidence!

329
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:28,678
What?

330
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:29,778
Mr. Tome.

331
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:34,478
Will you please conduct the test Conan required just now?

332
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:35,678
Roger.

333
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,878
Gunpowder reaction!

334
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,378
Gunpowder reaction?

335
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:52,778
When you fire a gun,

336
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:55,178
gunpowder will fly in all directions!

337
00:19:55,178 --> 00:19:58,678
Later, once sprayed with nitrous acid,

338
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:01,179
the gunpowder on clothes and furniture will react,

339
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,678
and turn a purplish red.

340
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,178
Oh, yeah.

341
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,189
You said when you left Guam on Saturday night,

342
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,978
you were firing guns at the shooting range, weren't you?

343
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:18,078
When you returned the cooler to the tank,

344
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:21,199
it must have touched the gunpowder on your clothes.

345
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:27,205
Excuse me.

346
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:34,878
Darn it! Why did it?

347
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,778
I thought it was perfect.

348
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,978
The alibi that you worked so hard to create

349
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,219
has become the evidence that revealed your crime.

350
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:44,878
Why? Why did you kill Mr. Nishida?

351
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:47,578
I thought you respected him?

352
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,978
I did, until five years ago.

353
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:53,231
He was a genius aquarium designer.

354
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:57,235
I really... I really respected him.

355
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,237
Until five years ago?

356
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,678
What exactly does that mean?

357
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,978
Nishida stopped coming up with designs five years ago.

358
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,378
He'd used up his talent.

359
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,478
That's why in the last five years,

360
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:14,178
all of his works were actually designed by me.

361
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:15,253
By you?

362
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,255
Right.

363
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,278
I have been Nishida's shadow.

364
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,978
But it was fine with me.

365
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,378
Under the name of the genius designer,

366
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:26,478
as long as I could design what I liked!

367
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:29,267
I was content being merely a shadow

368
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,778
because I respected Nishida!

369
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:32,978
But then,

370
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,978
when Nishida discovered talented people from the younger generation,

371
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:39,277
he discarded me and used them instead.

372
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,778
I couldn't forgive him!

373
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:43,281
I had dedicated so much to him,

374
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:45,283
and yet he cast me aside so readily.

375
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,378
If he was going to abandon me,

376
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:51,578
then I decided to abandon him instead!

377
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:54,278
Or so I thought...

378
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:24,178
"One week later" -The fish were so cute!

379
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:26,278
They were so pretty!

380
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,978
The big shark was really cool!

381
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:31,678
Those schools of sardines were great too!

382
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,391
Instead of that,

383
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,078
I'm hungry.

384
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,678
Now that you mention it...

385
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:40,278
It's already 2:00 in the afternoon.

386
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:42,378
Let's go eat something.

387
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,378
All right!

388
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:46,378
What would you like to eat?

389
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:50,178
Grilled eel!

390
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,978
Sashimi would be nice!

391
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:53,778
I wanna eat sushi!

392
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:55,078
Hey, hey.

393
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:58,878
You're going to eat the fish that you just said were cute?

394
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:01,078
You don't say...

395
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,423
"Button".

397
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,425
The kind that you push, isn't it?

398
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,336
The other kind.

399
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:09,900
The kind that comes falling to the bottom-windfall.
