1
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:06,115
Another letter of warning of an upcoming crime is delivered.

2
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,815
However, this time he says he's coming to return

3
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:10,915
the items that another thief had stolen previously

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,215
to its original owner.

5
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:17,715
All three items belonged to Ryoma Sakamoto.

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,215
Meanwhile, the original owner Mr. Tarumi

7
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,215
and the appraiser Mr. Hanamura

8
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,515
held a Ryoma exhibition in the Great Suzuki Museum.

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:28,815
At the exhibition grounds, the gunbelt with a ruby on it

10
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:31,915
that was given to Ryoma by Shinsaku Takasugi, along with a pistol,

11
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,315
was on display.

12
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:38,115
Rumors that Thief Kid may be after the gunbelt also go around.

13
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:39,815
Metal detector gates are set up

14
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:41,815
at the entrance of the exhibition grounds

15
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:43,615
since among the items that Thief Kid will be returning,

16
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:46,515
a pistol is included.

17
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,515
But, something bothers me.

18
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,115
Will such a method really help to capture Thief Kid?

19
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,315
Like the fog clears.

20
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,515
Let's see through love and crime as well.

21
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,415
Unbelievable, he's returning the treasure.

22
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:01,515
What is Thief Kid's real target?

23
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:03,215
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,115
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,215
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:54,156
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 2)"

27
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,256
Officers guarding the entrance of the museum!

28
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:00,456
How are thing there?

29
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:05,656
Yes, sir! There's no one who was surprised by the gate and left!

30
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:08,456
Are the metal detector gates functioning all right?

31
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:12,356
Yes, sir! Nobody is in possession of the pistol in question.

32
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,056
How about in the exhibition room?

33
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:18,656
There is no one who looks to be Thief Kid here for now.

34
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,356
Is Thief Kid really going to show up?

35
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,856
Idiot!

36
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,056
There isn't a time that Kid had warned of a crime

37
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,256
and not shown up!

38
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:27,156
I'm sorry, sir!

39
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,756
Come on, Kid.

40
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:34,356
I'll nab you for sure this time!

41
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:41,156
Wow! Fantastic!

42
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:44,556
It really looks like the boarding gate at the airport!

43
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:47,056
Moreover, there are three gates too.

44
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,956
Uncle sure is something!

45
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,156
Something bothers me, after all.

46
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,856
Writing something like,

47
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:58,756
"I'll be bringing the pistol with me" deliberately,

48
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:00,556
I'm sure he would assume that something like this

49
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,556
would happen, and yet...

50
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,356
In addition, I can't even make out

51
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:08,656
how he plans to use the rain to his advantage yet, either.

52
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,656
The last sentence of the letter.

53
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,556
"I pledge to clean up once and for all."

54
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,956
I don't understand what it means.

55
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:19,756
Did he just happen to use Ryoma's phrase to play on words?

56
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:24,856
Or, is he really planning to wash something?

57
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:26,956
Come on! Let's go inside too!

58
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,556
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:33,656
It's set up so that the corridor on the other side of the entrance

60
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,056
of the Ryoma Exhibition is blocked off by a wall

61
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:40,556
so you have to go through the gate get inside.

62
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:44,656
The only thing that is in between is the restroom, but...

63
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:46,656
Inside the restroom...

64
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,856
There was only one window

65
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:55,756
with bars and coming in from outside is impossible.

66
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,456
So, it would be impossible to bring a pistol inside

67
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:59,056
under the present situation.

68
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:00,456
Conan?

69
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,456
We're going in.

70
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,556
Yes!

71
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,456
Check out the crowd of people here.

72
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:10,756
Attention please!

73
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:13,756
The exhibition ground is getting to be very crowded.

74
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,856
We are sorry to announce that

75
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,356
viewing the Ryoma Exhibition

76
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,556
will be limited to ten minutes.

77
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:23,556
So they say, but it looks like nobody's leaving.

78
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,056
-Yeah. -Right!

79
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:28,856
There's still two hours to go before the assumed arrival time,

80
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:32,356
but maybe Sir Thief Kid is already mingled somewhere in here already.

81
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:34,556
But, you can't go through the gate

82
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:36,656
with a pistol on you, can you?

83
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:39,656
Besides, the items that he's returning today

84
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,456
are things that another thief stole,

85
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,156
so he may just call it off, right?

86
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:47,756
What do you mean by another thief?

87
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:50,756
The three items that Thief Kid is going to return this time...

88
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:54,456
Ryoma's last letter, the blood stained goblet

89
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:57,756
and the pistol that he had in his pocket when he was assassinated

90
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:00,556
are all things that a woman thief

91
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,156
called Phantom Lady stole 20 years ago!

92
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,356
Who's Phantom Lady?

93
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:09,556
She was called the woman with 20 faces of the Showa era

94
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:11,456
and was a great thief who used horrific methods

95
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,656
to steal only from businesses and rich people

96
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,356
who were making money by evil means.

97
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:18,456
Therefore, she seems to have been really popular!

98
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:22,556
Well, she isn't as great as my Sir Thief Kid, though.

99
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:28,456
But, why is Kid returning the items that the lady thief stole?

100
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,056
How should I know?

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,856
Maybe they know each other?

102
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:34,056
After all, they're both thieves.

103
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:38,456
Oh, I got to go to the men's room again,

104
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:41,356
-so go on ahead without me. -Oh, okay.

105
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:42,556
Geez.

106
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:47,256
Look at the crowd of people here.

107
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:49,656
It's like a bargain sale or something.

108
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,456
Oh, Sonoko, are you all right?

109
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,656
Ouch...

110
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:58,256
Geez, who pushed me?

111
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:01,956
Phantom Lady...

112
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,556
Found it!

113
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,256
I guess there's no mistake that Phantom Lady

114
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:09,356
was the one who stole the three items 20 years ago.

115
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,256
But, for some reason, after that one incident,

116
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,756
she stopped committing crimes completely.

117
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,256
Rather, even after that incident,

118
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:17,156
although she sent out advance warnings of crimes

119
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:19,556
and traces of her having broken in were found,

120
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:22,356
nothing was stolen.

121
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,856
The last thing she stole was Ryoma's pistol.

122
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:30,256
A 32 caliber 5 bullet model

123
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:33,256
with a length of about 17cm.

124
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:36,756
17cm is about...

125
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,556
This long?

126
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:43,256
June 24th, 1867.

127
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,956
The pistol is also mentioned in the letter

128
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:47,556
that Ryoma wrote to his older sister Otome on that date.

129
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:50,356
The length is about 3.03cm, capable of holding 5 bullets

130
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:52,756
and smaller than a dagger, but...

131
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:58,756
it can shoot people dead from a distance.

132
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,656
-You see! -Kid!

133
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:04,056
The door won't open!

134
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:08,056
Darn! He closed it using a stopper.

135
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,456
How'd you get that pistol through?

136
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,856
You mean you made it through the gate?

137
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,456
Yeah.

138
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:16,656
Removing the lead that was in the grip made going through a breeze!

139
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,356
It becomes really light too.

140
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:19,656
Well, but since they were in large numbers,

141
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:22,256
it wasn't that easy carrying them, though!

142
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,256
The lead in the grip?

143
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:26,056
In large numbers?

144
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:27,856
What're you talking about?

145
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:29,156
Let me remind you once more.

146
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:33,056
I just came to return items that were stolen this time.

147
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:35,556
So, don't you get in the way, famed detective!

148
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,256
-See you! -Oh, hey.

149
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:38,656
Hold it!

150
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,556
Darn!

151
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,756
Hey, are you sure everything's okay?

152
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:50,456
If Thief Kid is nabbed by the police...

153
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,056
Don't worry!

154
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:55,056
Let's believe in him who appears at most unexpected places.

155
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:59,756
If he makes a clean get away, we'll make a lot of cash again.

156
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:03,756
But, he's coming to return the items, you know!

157
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,356
No need for worry.

158
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:08,756
I've got everything thought out.

159
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,156
Say, mister.

160
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:13,156
What happened to you finger?

161
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,656
Oh.

162
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:17,056
I was appraising a Japanese sword this morning

163
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,656
and cut my finger then...

164
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:31,956
Darn! He's already inside the exhibition room?

165
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:36,756
Where?

166
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,056
Where'd he go?

167
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,656
What're you...

168
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,056
Ran?

169
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,356
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:53,156
I figured you'd get squashed in this crowd.

171
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,956
But, at this rate,

172
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:57,756
it'll get even worse at the announced time.

173
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,356
Sonoko.

174
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:02,656
There's something on your right sleeve.

175
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,756
I think something's written.

176
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,756
One of the iron ones?

177
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,456
One of the iron ones?

178
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:13,156
Is it some kind of code?

179
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,156
Sonoko,

180
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,856
didn't you bump into something inside the exhibition room?

181
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:21,356
That's right,

182
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:22,756
somebody pushed me

183
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,656
and I fell to the showcase where the gunbelt was.

184
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:27,456
The showcase where the gunbelt is displayed.

185
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:34,856
Don't tell me that he's really going to make it rain

186
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:39,156
in order to clean this corrupted exhibition hall up.

187
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:46,456
Darn, Kid!

188
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,656
Where the heck is he planning to sneak in from?

189
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,956
Inspector Nakamori.

190
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:52,756
He may be capable of appearing at unexpected places

191
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:53,756
at unexpected times,

192
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:56,756
yet he couldn't possibly get through that metal detector gate

193
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,256
-while carrying a pistol. -Yeah, I'd like to think so too.

194
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:04,056
-But he... -If he were to break through the gate,

195
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:08,056
that pistol is a replica that he made,

196
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:10,456
is that it?

197
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:13,856
Of course, after all the three items are returned,

198
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,456
I'll have you appraise them, Mr. Hanamura.

199
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:17,556
Yes.

200
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:20,656
I sure hope that they're all genuine.

201
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:24,556
Never mind that, but I hope Ryoma's gunbelt is all right?

202
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:27,856
We did a final check of the exhibition cases

203
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:29,956
just before opening, you see.

204
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,456
If you like, would you like to go to the site?

205
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:33,756
Yes.

206
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,456
If the three items that are returned turn out to be fake

207
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:40,156
and the moreover, the gunbelt is stolen,

208
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:43,056
I wouldn't be able to take it.

209
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,056
It's getting to be crowded.

210
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:53,756
Only four minutes more to the time Sir Kid announced he'd be here.

211
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,556
Do you think we should start on our way inside?

212
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,456
But, with all these people here,

213
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,156
we may not be able to see Kid even if he appears.

214
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:02,356
Oh. Inspector Nakamori.

215
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,556
Uncle Jirokichi too!

216
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,856
Police! Please open the way!

217
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:09,156
Police!

218
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:11,556
Come on, let's go on in too!

219
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,956
I don't think you should!

220
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:18,456
Conan?

221
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:20,656
Why shouldn't we go inside?

222
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,556
Because, you don't want to get wet, do you?

223
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:27,556
I think Kid is really thinking of washing and cleaning here!

224
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:30,056
Darn! They're just too many people here.

225
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,256
We couldn't possibly guard this place safely.

226
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:34,656
What?

227
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,656
What's that?

228
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,756
Thief Kid!

229
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:59,303
Thief Kid!

230
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,803
He's standing on top of the gunbelt case.

231
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:06,103
Sir Kid is so fantastic.

232
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:09,203
He's gone through the metal detector and is unarmed!

233
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:11,903
-Nab him! -Yes, sir!

234
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,303
How dare you, Kid?

235
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:17,303
Clean up, my foot!

236
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:22,203
I'll get you and give you a good clean wash instead!

237
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:25,003
Yes. Clean wash.

238
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:29,103
In order to give a clean wash, water is needed.

239
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:32,303
So, starting now, right here...

240
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:39,003
Watch, I shall make it rain.

241
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:40,603
Rain?

242
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:43,403
What the heck is he planning to do?

243
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,303
That rat.

244
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:57,103
He used fire to set the extinguisher sprinkler off!

245
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,203
I shall be on my way, then.

246
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:00,503
Hey, hold it!

247
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:03,703
Weren't you going to return the three items in question?

248
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:08,103
This shower will bring everything to light.

249
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:11,603
As the rain shall wash away polluted water.

250
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,503
That rat!

251
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:19,103
He changed the water pressure of the sprinkler!

252
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:21,703
He's disappearing within the smoke of water...

253
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:23,103
Darn.

254
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:35,803
He disappeared?

255
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,003
That Kid!

256
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:40,003
He's going to mingle among the crowd and flee!

257
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,103
Hey!

258
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,703
How many people went outside where the gate is just now?

259
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:45,103
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:48,003
-There were about two or three people. -It's them!

261
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,103
Among them, nab the one who is drenched!

262
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,903
He's the Kid!

263
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:55,803
If he changed clothes inside that shower and disguised himself,

264
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,103
he should be soaking wet!

265
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,003
But...

266
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,403
it's also raining heavily outside too,

267
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,703
so most of the people are wet.

268
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,303
Then, look at his feet!

269
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:08,003
Go after the wet footsteps that left the gate!

270
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:12,903
But most naturally the floor is also filled with wet footprints.

271
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:15,103
What?

272
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,403
I see.

273
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:20,203
That's why he was waiting for a rainy day.

274
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,903
Then, what about the three items he said he'd be returning?

275
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:24,903
They're right here.

276
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:30,003
They're on top this gunbelt case.

277
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:35,003
Oops, the goblet's got my blood on it.

278
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:39,103
Oh well, but all three of them seem to be replicas...

279
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,903
So there should be no problem.

280
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:44,003
If there should be need for concern, it would be this gunbelt but...

281
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:48,203
The crime prevention device inside is destroyed!

282
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,903
Which means that the gunbelt that is inside is a fake

283
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,803
that Kid had switched for the genuine one! Darn!

284
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:56,903
He got what he wanted after all.

285
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:59,003
Huh?

286
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:01,103
Is anything the matter?

287
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:03,503
The explanation plate in the case.

288
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:05,703
Something's hanging from it.

289
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,203
Paint?

290
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:09,703
What? It's doubled.

291
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,003
I see!

292
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:15,303
A duplicate explanatory plate written in water color

293
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:17,403
was pasted on top of the one on the bottom and made

294
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:22,603
so that when wet by water, the words written below would emerge.

295
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:23,903
I see!

296
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,403
It was because my sleeve was wet with rain.

297
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,603
Yes.

298
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:30,003
The words on the explanatory plate of the gunbelt

299
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,903
rubbed off as mirrored image.

300
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,103
Yes.

301
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:35,603
And? What's written on it?

302
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,903
Let's see.

303
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:41,603
This gunbelt is super fake to begin with because...

304
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:44,103
Because it's been mass produced

305
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,503
taking into consideration the fact that it may be stolen.

306
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,803
That's right, isn't it?

307
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,403
The important thing is

308
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,403
the fact that it was stolen makes the news,

309
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,703
and that this is known the world over.

310
00:16:55,703 --> 00:17:00,303
So, replicas of the item was made in large quantities to begin with,

311
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:04,803
then sold by a third party to rich Ryoma fans.

312
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:09,103
Telling them that it's the item that was stolen the other day!

313
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:10,803
The advantage of this method,

314
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:14,103
is that even if the buyer realizes that he bought a fake,

315
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:16,503
a complaint won't be submitted.

316
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,403
Because they feel guilty about having secretly bought a stolen item,

317
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:23,203
they have no way of making a case of it, even if they wanted to.

318
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:26,103
That's why the crimes that Phantom Lady committed

319
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:30,303
after stealing the three items didn't come into the light.

320
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:35,303
She probably only targeted the people who purchased the three items.

321
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:39,903
Phantom Lady gave you all the load fake items that she collected

322
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:44,703
and asked you to disclose the evil deeds of the two, didn't she?

323
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,703
She also told you that this crime wouldn't have been possible

324
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:50,003
without the host who exhibited the items knowing they were fake

325
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,703
and the corrupt appraiser who appraised

326
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:56,303
the items as being authentic joining hands.

327
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,703
Isn't that right?

328
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,803
Thief Kid disguised as Ryoma!

329
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:10,803
Hey! Is the thing written on the plate true?

330
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,103
No! That's just nonsense!

331
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:18,603
In the first place, where is the large amount of fake items anyway?

332
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:21,603
The only three items here are a plastic pistol,

333
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:24,803
fake goblet and a letter.

334
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,803
Inspector!

335
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:30,303
We have a gunbelt around our hips and a pistol!

336
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,703
There's one on my hips too.

337
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,203
What?

338
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:43,803
Taken from Mr. Tarumi's storage room, it says.

339
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:45,703
Darn, Kid!

340
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:50,303
He used the crowd to wrap the gunbelts around our hips!

341
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,903
I see.

342
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,803
He broke the crime prevention device to begin with,

343
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,803
and made it look to be stolen.

344
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:01,103
This time the scheme was to sell the gunbelt.

345
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:03,003
-Oh, well... -Inspector!

346
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,603
What is it now?

347
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,303
The paint of the other explanatory plates is coming off

348
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,303
-and words are appearing. -What?

349
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:13,303
It's written in great detail,

350
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,503
what and where of this item are fake!

351
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:18,103
Moreover, at the end of the letter it is written in English.

352
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,103
In English?

353
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,203
Pull.

354
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:25,003
Pull... pull down?

355
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:29,803
Does it mean to pull this hanging scroll?

356
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:35,803
What is it?

357
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:50,303
This is...

358
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:51,703
Ryoma's letter!

359
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:55,403
Moreover, many of the same kind of letters!

360
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,303
They seem to be complete replicas of the letter

361
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:02,103
that was found on the gunbelt case.

362
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,603
A trap!

363
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,903
This is a trap that Kid set up!

364
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:06,903
Sir!

365
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:11,903
You have no proof that we made them and sold them off.

366
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,203
Hey, Sonoko?

367
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:18,103
But, that's what's written on Sir Kid's plate!

368
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:19,803
To crack it.

369
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:22,803
Hey, what's this?

370
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:27,003
There is a large number of goblets inside!

371
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:31,603
Moreover, each of them seem to be stained with blood.

372
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:34,303
If we do a DNA check of the blood,

373
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:39,403
it'll be obvious who made the fake goblets.

374
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,003
Do you want to make it through by touching it

375
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:43,503
with your hurt finger like you did a while ago?

376
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:48,003
So as to stain all the goblets here with your own blood.

377
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,303
Well, I'm sure that if we check your storage room,

378
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,803
we'll come up with the items, no?

379
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:56,003
A heap of the fake items that you couldn't sell off.

380
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:22,003
Amazing that you figured out that I'm Thief Kid.

381
00:22:22,003 --> 00:22:25,303
I'm no different from any other man around, am I?

382
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,103
Simple!

383
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:30,403
Even if the pistols are made of plastic,

384
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:31,503
they would become quite a load

385
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:33,503
if you have to carry a great number of them, right?

386
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:34,703
If you also have to carry a large amount of goblets

387
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:37,503
and letters at the same time, the more so!

388
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:41,503
That's why I looked for a thin person

389
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:45,403
from hip down who was mingled among the crowd!

390
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:48,003
And I found you, who had a whole lot of stuff stashed on yourself,

391
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:52,003
so you had to disguise yourself as a fat man.

392
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,703
Of course, since you're in disguise,

393
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:56,203
you weren't perspiring either!

394
00:22:56,203 --> 00:23:02,303
I stuck a button type transmitter on the guy's thin ankle,

395
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:05,403
confirmed your location using these pursuit glasses,

396
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:07,803
and called out to you!

397
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,403
Well?

398
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:12,503
Do you plan to turn me into the police?

399
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:13,803
No.

400
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:18,703
In respect of Ryoma, I will let you go this time.

401
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:20,503
Are you a Ryoma fan?

402
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,803
It's Mom!

403
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,903
She played the role of Otome, Ryoma's older sister once

404
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,703
and is head over heels over him.

405
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,903
I see.

406
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:33,703
Well, she was said to be too cute to play the role of Otome,

407
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,203
and that's what triggered her popularity, though.

408
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:41,503
Well, but we mutually...

409
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,303
cannot beat our mothers.

410
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:48,003
See ya

411
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:55,203
Mutually?

412
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:59,303
Hey, don't tell me that Phantom Lady is...

413
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,620
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,980
"Liquid Foundation" (Li Kid for Thief Kid)

415
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,060
Maybe I'll get to see Sir Thief Kid again in the next episode.

416
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,680
After all, it's "Likid".

417
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,860
Sonoko.
