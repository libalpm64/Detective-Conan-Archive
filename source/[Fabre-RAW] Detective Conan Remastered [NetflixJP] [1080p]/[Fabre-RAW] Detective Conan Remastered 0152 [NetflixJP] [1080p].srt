1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,660
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,360
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,260
Today is about a strange passenger on the bus.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,260
The incident unfolds into something beyond Imagination.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,860
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,860
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,260
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,370
-Run! -Hey!

9
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,770
Ran, hurry! Quick!

10
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,370
-Wait, bus! Wait! -I'm getting on!

11
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,470
Thank God.

12
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,370
We made it.

13
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,870
It's because you try to buy everything at once.

14
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,370
Talk for yourself.

15
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,870
Look at all the outlet brand goods you bought too.

16
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,470
But I really wanted this.

17
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,770
Oh. I see.

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,570
I'm happy for you.

19
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,170
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

20
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,470
Good night.

21
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,670
It's not fair.

22
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,370
Let me know when It's time to get off.

23
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,570
Geez.

24
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,870
"The old man disappears"

25
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,070
Are you all right?

26
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,270
Yes.

27
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,170
I thought they finally got me.

28
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,470
This jabbed me in the stomach.

29
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,370
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,870
Aren't you Mr. Mouri's daughter?

31
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,970
Yes. And you are?

32
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,670
I'm Shitara, Jukichi Shitara.

33
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,670
"Jukichi Shitara (70)" -It's not surprising

34
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,270
that you don't remember me though.

35
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,370
Mr. Shitara?

36
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,670
It's written like this.

37
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,070
"Shitara"

38
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,870
It's a nice name. I am Ran Mouri.

39
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,770
Today is quite humid, isn't it?

40
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,170
Yes. Because it's raining, I guess.

41
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,870
"Ran Mouri" -This is how my name is written.

42
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,670
Thank you so much.

43
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,270
It's nothing.

44
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,870
I was on my way to visit your father.

45
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,470
Is it a request for an investigation?

46
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,670
Yes.

47
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,570
But it's not the kind of work that can be discussed over the phone.

48
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,770
By the way, is the Muromachi Hospital still far from here?

49
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,070
What? You mean the bus stop.

50
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,770
Let's see.

51
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,270
It's the fourth station from here.

52
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,670
I'm going to ride way pass there.

53
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,170
Would you like me to let you know when it's time for you to get off?

54
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,370
Thank you so much for your kindness.

55
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,470
No problem.

56
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,470
Ran...

57
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,870
It's time to get up.

58
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,070
Come on, get up.

59
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,070
We're almost there.

60
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,370
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

61
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,970
Gosh. I'm the one who asked you to wake me,

62
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,270
and I'm waking you up instead!

63
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,370
What?

64
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,570
Is it Muromachi Hospital yet?

65
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,870
We've passed that station a long time ago! What?

66
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,370
Did the old man get off all right?

67
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,370
What?

68
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,470
The old man.

69
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,670
His name was Mr. Shitara.

70
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,170
Who's that?

71
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,370
The man that was sitting next to me!

72
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,670
How should I know?

73
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,970
I didn't see such an old man.

74
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,970
That's because you were asleep, Sonoko.

75
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,470
Don't ask me, then.

76
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,770
Maybe you were dreaming or something?

77
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,570
Dreaming?

78
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,470
I wonder if it was a dream.

79
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,870
Ran!

80
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,570
Excuse me. Did an old man get off at Muromachi Hospital Station?

81
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,970
An old man who was wearing a cap and was holding an umbrella.

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,170
I'm not so sure

83
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,670
because a lot of passengers get on and off at that bus stop.

84
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,670
I see.

85
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,270
So, we're home! Home at last.

86
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,670
Well, do you want to stop by and grab something to eat?

87
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,570
Hello?

88
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,270
-It still bothers me. -What does?

89
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,370
Taxi!

90
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,970
What?

91
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,070
Keep me company, Sonoko.

And just what do you intend to do now?

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,770
We're going to ask around.

96
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,770
Why are you so concerned over that old man?

97
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,670
Something about that old man bothers me!

98
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,970
I'm sure I met him somewhere,

99
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,970
but I can't remember.

100

I was on my way to visit your father.

102
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,470
It seems he wanted to ask dad for an investigation.

103
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,770
How about over there, then?

104
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,770

He doesn't seem to be here.

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,170
He's not here?

110
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,270
Yes, his name is not listed

111
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,870
among the out-patient list or the in-patient.

Oh, I see.

113
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,170
How strange, though.

114
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,070
That old man said that he was going to the hospital, right?

115
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,870
I think so. I wonder if he just came here to visit someone.

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,170
No, I don't think so.

117

The name Mr. Shitara is not on the list of visitors either.

You're being over anxious.

119
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,970
If he wants to see your dad,

120
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,370
he must have contacted him first.

121
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,170
I guess so.

122
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,270
It has to be.

123
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,270
If not, the old man never existed in the first place.

An old man disappeared?

That's all I can think of.

128
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,570
Sonoko thinks it's just my imagination,

but something bothers me.

I wonder if you could ask Inspector Megure to look for the old man.

I guess not.

Of course not!

Well, it's understandable, but...

Can't you somehow figure out the password

and open the file, Dr. Agasa?

Okay. I'll contact you when I get to open the file.

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,970
to compensate for my vague memory.

171
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,170
So, it's you after all.

172
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,370
Please help me, Sonoko.

173
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,670
Gosh! I just took a shower and was feeling refreshed.

174
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,670
What's with that car?

175
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,770
Hey, Conan! Looks straight ahead! It's dangerous.

176
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,470
Ran, that car.

177
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,670
What?

178
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,870
There's nothing. Now, look ahead.

179
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,870
Like I said this afternoon,

180
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,270
I don't remember a thing about the old man.

181
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,770
I see.

182
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,370
Something may be left where the old man was sitting.

183
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,070
-That's right! -Hold on.

184
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,570
This bus wasn't the bus earlier.

185
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,970
What?

186
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,370
That bus was not functioning too well,

187
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,270
so it's under maintenance now.

188
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,970
Let's go! Ran!

189
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,970
Okay!

190
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,770
It must've been about you girls.

191
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,070
-What? -What do you mean?

192
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,570
Well, I was asked where a girl named Mouri,

193
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,770
who was on the bus, got off.

194
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,470
-What? -No! What does that mean?

195
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,770
Creepy.

196
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,270
What kind of person was the one who asked you that?

197
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,970
What kind of person is that person?

198
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,870
Well, he was wearing a coat and sunglasses.

199
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,070
Could it be...

200
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,470
That man?

201
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,770
Do you know him?

202
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,470
But, why?

203
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,370
Let's hurry, Ran!

204
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,370
The old man who disappeared.

205
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,870
A top secret M.O.

206
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,570
The man who is wearing sunglasses.

207
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,370
Something smells fishy!

208
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
"Heian Bus Company"

209
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,260
Please wait here.

210
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
Wait, mister!

211
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,360
Hey... You can't come in!

212
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,460
I'm sorry. I forgot something on the bus!

213
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,560
Over there, Conan.

214
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
Hey!

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,160
No doubt about it. It's here.

216
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,860
I sat here, and the old man sat next to me.

217
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,760
Do you remember anything else?

218
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,660
That's right! His name!

219
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,660
His name?

220
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,060
Right, he wrote his name on the window back then,

221
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,560
because the window was cloudy.

222
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,660
Like this, with his fingers.

223
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,560
But, it's gone already.

224
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,360
"Shitara, Ran Mouri"

225
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,860
It wasn't a dream after all.

226
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,460
What's going on?

227
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,460
I have no idea what is going on.

228
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,760
Hello.

229
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,260
What? You figured out the password?

230
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,960
Yeah and about the contents of the disc.

231
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,660
This is double accounting.

232
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,360
Double accounting?

233
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,960
You know the company Beika Construction Company, don't you?

234
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,660
It's something that was taken out of their accounting department.

235
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,260
It has a dummy account book,

236
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
and an account book that corresponds to that

237
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,760
which shows all the bribes given to politicians and all.

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,160
The names of all the corrupted assembly men

239
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,360
that had transactions dealing with the general assembly meeting

240
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,260
of stockholders are also listed.

241
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,560
I see.

242
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,360
The old man was sought after

243
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,860
because he had the double account book on him.

244
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,460
Yes. I thought they finally got me.

245
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,060
The man wearing sunglasses was not after me,

246
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,560
but rather, after the old man.

247
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,960
Yes. That's why the old man who realized that he was being tailed,

248
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,160
put this MO into your pochette.

249
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,860
Yes, and also because he knew that I was Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

250
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,560
We've got to find the old man!

251
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,260
What do you mean to find him?

252
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,960
We don't even know where he is after he gets off the bus.

253
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,060
The newspaper agency!

254
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,460
What?

255
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,560
He went to the newspaper agency

256
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
after leaving the double account book with me!

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
I see!

258
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,760
-No! -What?

259
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Try and remember.

260
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,560
The man who was wearing sunglasses asked the bus driver

261
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,860
about you, right?

262
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,360
Which means he found out that the old man didn't have the account book!

263
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,860
That's why he was looking for Ran

264
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,260
who was sitting next to him on the bus!

265
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,560
Yes, in other words...

266
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,660
The old man was captured by the man wearing sunglasses?

267
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,460
Ran, call Pops and Inspector Megure!

268
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,160
Where are you going?

269
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm going to look around the area where the old man got off!

270
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
I'll go too.

271
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,060
No!

272
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,160
Since they are after you,

273
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,260
stay and wait for me here at the bus company!

274
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,560
Okay!

275
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,760
Excuse me, may I use your phone?

276
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,260
Go ahead.

277
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,260
My telephone card.

278
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Will you hold this for me?

279
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay.

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
No, that's not it, dad.

281
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,660
Are you listening to me?

282
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,560
Don't sleep on me!

283
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,160
Yes, I'm listening...

284
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,260
Gosh, how can he be like that at a time like this!

285
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,360
Well, is he coming right away?

286
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
I can't get through to him at all!

287
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,660
I'm calling Inspector Megure!

288
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,160
It's pretty good for something that was bought at the outlet.

289
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,560
That is bad!

290
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,660
Yes, that's right.

291
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm at the Heian Bus Company right now.

292
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,060
Bad news!

293
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,560
The other girls were kidnapped!

294
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,160
Shinichi, it's me.

295
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
What up, Dr. Agasa?

296
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,460
Ran just called saying that Sonoko has been kidnapped!

297
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
What?

298
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
The kidnappers car seems to have gone to the left

299
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
after leaving the bus company!

300
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,760
Left, which means the other way!

301
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,560
Driver, please make a U-turn!

302
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,660
What?

303
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,860
Hey, you're late.

304
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,260
Sorry, it took me some time to get to her.

305
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,160
Strange!

306
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,260
We should have overtaken the kidnapper's car by now!

307
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,060
On one side of this road is the fence of a factory.

308
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,760
Which means they made a left turn somewhere!

309
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,260
Driver, please turn right, over there!

310
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,160
Does this road lead out somewhere?

311
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,760
No, beyond here is a warehouse area, and it's a dead end!

312
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,460
Using this road as a short-cut wouldn't do any good

313
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,460
because you'd have to go all the way around anyway!

314
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,060
Which means that Sonoko is somewhere nearby!

315
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,260
Beika Construction Company?

316
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,460
"Kakuda Construction Resources"

317
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,660
"Tamamoto Construction"

318
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,560
"Ryujin Economics Research Lab"

319
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,260
Wait a second.

320
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,160
The one who's going to be in trouble

321
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,660
when the double accounting book is publicized

322
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,960
is not only the Beika Construction Company.

323
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,760
All the companies that had behind the curtain dealings are involved.

324
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,460
Dr. Agasa! Is there a place called

325
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,760
Ryujin Economics Research Lab in the list of the MO?

326
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,560
Wait.

327
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I found it, Shinichi!

328
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,860
A lot of money is involved here.

329
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,360
Thank you, Dr. Agasa.

330
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,060
Stupid, she's not the one!

331
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,860
What? You mean the other one?

332
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,760
You goofed it.

333
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,460
I'm sorry, boss.

334
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,560
She had the pochette with her

335
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
so I thought she was the one.

336
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Go again and get her!

337
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,060
Okay, boss.

338
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,560
Don't goof it this time now!

339
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Yeah, okay.

340
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,460
What're we going to do with them?

341
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,160
Without the disc,

342
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,460
we don't need them anymore!

343
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,360
Get rid of them.

344
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,260
What the...

345
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,860
What is this kid doing here?

346
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
I'm Conan Edogawa!

347
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,660
A detective!

348
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,060
You brat!

349
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,460
The two sunglasses men turned out to be bad men

350
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,060
who had dealings behind the curtains

351
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,460
with Beika Construction Company.

352
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,460
And, Mr. Jukichi Shitara,

353
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,360
who was an executive of the Beika Construction Company for a long time,

354
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,460
decided to take the double accounting book

355
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,960
out of the company after pondering.

356
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,660
Sonoko!

357
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Ran...

358
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,360
I was so scared.

359
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,060
I'm glad.

360
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,660
I'm so glad that you're okay, Sonoko.

361
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,160
The following day,

362
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,960
Beika Construction Company was searched by the police.

363
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,260
Thanks to the courage of one old man who reported the crime.

364
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,760
"Mouri Detective Agency"

365
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,560
"Cafe Poirot"

366
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,960
I still think I've seen that old man somewhere.

367
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,860
You still can't remember, Ran?

368
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,860
That old man was an executive of the Beika Construction Company,

369
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,460
so maybe you saw him in the papers or on television?

370
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,460
-I wonder... -Hi, there, upstairs people.

371
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,260
Here's your sandwich with coffee and orange juice.

372
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Here you go.

373
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,360
Thank you.

374
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,260
I wonder if I'm mistaken after all.

375
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,660
No...

376
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,260
You didn't mistaken about anything.

377
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,960
Grampa!

378
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,460
Mr. Jukichi Shitara was a patron of the coffee shop

379
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,460
that is located below the Mouri Detective Agency.
