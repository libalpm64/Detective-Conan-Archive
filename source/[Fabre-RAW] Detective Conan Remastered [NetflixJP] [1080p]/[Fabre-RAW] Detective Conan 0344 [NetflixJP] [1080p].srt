1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,940
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,940
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,940
Ran encounters a queer case at the convenience store.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,740
She makes a pure deduction in order to help her friend.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,260
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 2)"

9
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Who are you?

10
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Jodie? Jodie!

11
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,060
Are you all right, Jodie?

12
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,660
Did you come across an idea or something?

13
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,360
You seemed to be in deep thought.

14
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,160
No idea. Not the slightest!

15
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Huh? What's the matter?

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,560
I saw you take off your glasses for the first time, so...

17
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
You know what I mean, don't you?

18
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,460
For the first time?

19
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,360
But those glasses sure look old.

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh, yes! This is something I cherish.

21
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,160
The only vestige that a person very, very important to me

22
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
left in this world.

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,660
That's why it's so very important!

24
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,560
A very important person?

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,860
Is it a keepsake of your ex-lover or something?

26
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,060
By the way, did you two figure out this case?

27
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,360
Not at all!

28
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,460
It stopped.

29
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,060
A delivery truck?

30
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,760
Right! The sales clerk mentioned it.

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,160
Remember? On the days that Aya is in charge,

32
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,360
even the boxes that arrive just before closing

33
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,460
are nicely organized, right?

34
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,060
Now that you mentioned it, the sales clerk said so.

35
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,860
So? How does that connect to what happened?

36
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,360
Well, I wonder how it connects.

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,060
I thought you had something in mind.

38
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,360
But...

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,760
There!

40
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,860
Here are the items you ordered!

41
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,460
Oh, you're early.

42
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,860
We'll stack the boxes up

43
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,260
as usual in the corridor in front of the restroom.

44
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Oh, a customer is still using the restroom. What should I do?

45
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,660
Oh. We'll bring the boxes over again later.

46
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,860
We got other places to make deliveries to too,

47
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,160
so we'll stop by again after we complete the other deliveries.

48
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Thank you.

49
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,160
Since a customer is using the restroom,

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,260
the boxes cannot be placed in front of the restroom.

51
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,960
If the boxes are placed there,

52
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,660
the customer cannot come out of the restroom.

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,560
We'll be back later then!

54
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Thank you, see you later!

55
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,860
On the days that Aya is in charge,

56
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,660
the boxes in front of the restroom are nicely organized.

57
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,160
What was it? That famous dialog by Holmes.

58
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,160
Shinichi used to remark haughtily.

59
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,660
When you have eliminated the impossible, then... this and that.

60
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,660
When you have eliminated the impossible.

61
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,160
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

62
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,960
however improbable,

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,760
must be the truth.

64
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,860
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

65
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,160
however improbable,

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
must be the truth.

67
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,560
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

68
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,660
however improbable,

69
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,860
must be the truth.

70
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,560
This dialog?

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,460
-Oh, yes! -What, what?

72
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,060
Don't tell me Ran, that you came across something?

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,260
-Oh, not really. -Stop bringing my hopes up again.

74
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,260
I think I got it. I feel like I got it

75
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,560
but I wonder if my deduction is correct.

76
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,960
My!

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,860
It's already 21:00!

78
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,360
I'll have to call mother.

79
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,260
The customers are decreasing.

80
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Yes.

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,860
-Aya! -Shopkeeper.

82
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,360
So, are you ready to confess?

83
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,960
But, I really haven't done anything.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,160
It seems I have no choice but to call the police!

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Oh, no.

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,060
What shall I do?

87
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,860
I could tell them about my deduction.

88
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,960
But what if I'm wrong? What if I'm off the point?

89
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,560
Then, I may be getting Aya into more trouble than helping her.

90
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,960
What shall I do?

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,460
What would he do at a time like this?

92
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,660
What would he do?

93
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,160
Caller unidentified?

94
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Hello?

95
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,060
Ran.

96
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,060
How're you doing?

97
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,460
Shi...

98
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
Shinichi?

99
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,960
Sorry, Ran.

100
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,460
I don't have anything to say

101
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,660
but there was a little something I wanted to ask you.

102
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,160
Shinichi.

103
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,460
Shinichi!

104
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,360
Huh? What?

105
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,760
Is it from Shinichi?

106
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,160
Yeah.

107
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,860
Hey, what's up?

108
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,160
My friend's in a tight situation right now.

109
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,660
You know her too,

110
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,960
Aya, who was our classmate in intermediate school.

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah, you mean Nanakawa?

112
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
For some reason, things disappear

113
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,460
at the convenience store where she works

114
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,260
and it happens only on the days

115
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
that Aya is in charge of cleaning and closing the store.

116
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,160
So, the shopkeeper suspects that Aya is stealing the things

117
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,960
and says that he will call the police unless she confesses.

118
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
There aren't any customers on the surveillance camera

119
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,760
that are shown stealing either.

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,860
The shopkeeper insists that there is no one but Aya

121
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,160
because he was watching the store after it closed,

122
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,460
but things disappeared after all.

123
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,860
And? What kinds of things have disappeared?

124
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,160
Game softwares, CDs, DVDs,

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,460
drinks, lunch boxes and candies.

126
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,560
According to Aya, she thinks that

127
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,960
there are three suspicious people among the customers.

128
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Oh, what kind of people are they? Those three?

129
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,860
One of them is a man that looks to be a university student

130
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,560
who reads game magazine till near closing time.

131
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,460
He bought some cup noodles and pouched food.

132
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,260
The second one is a timid office worker type of man

133
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,360
who always lets others go through the register

134
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,260
or use the restroom before him.

135
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,360
He bought a toothbrush set, a shaver, batteries and a towel.

136
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
The third one is a stubborn old lady

137
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,560
who asks for discounts on lunches are near shelf life expiration.

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,660
She seems to have bought nothing at the store.

139
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,960
And?

140
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
What all the three of them have in common

141
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,060
is that they frequently come to use the restroom at this store.

142
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,760
A month ago,

143
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,360
when Aya was scolded in front of the restroom by the shopkeeper,

144
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,060
things stopped disappearing just like that.

145
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,460
Then, last night, a month after the incident,

146
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,160
again on the night when Aya was in charge, things disappeared.

147
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I see, which means it's only natural that Nanakawa is suspected.

148
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,360
Wait! Don't talk like it's somebody else's problem!

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,060
And? There's something else, isn't there?

150
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,160
Something that only Nanakawa does on the days

151
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,760
that she is in charge that nobody else does.

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,060
Oh, yes. The other employees

153
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,260
leave the boxes that arrive just before closing time

154
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,260
stacked up in the corridor in front of the restroom, and go home

155
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,360
but, Aya organizes the boxes neatly before closing the store.

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,460
Since the surveillance cameras are working all this time,

157
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,960
it should be easy to prove Aya's innocence,

158
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,360
but the shopkeeper seems to turn off

159
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,560
the switch of the surveillance camera after operating hours.

160
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Weren't the lunches that were stolen

161
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,160
all near shelf life expiration?

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,360
Huh? How do you know?

163
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,760
Just as I thought.

164
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,060
The culprit is probably a pretty nice person.

165
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,160
What? You know who the culprit is?

166
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Yeah, the culprit is probably...

167
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,260
Wait, Shinichi!

168
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,060
I sort of came up with my own deduction.

169
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,260
So, will you hear me out without laughing?

170
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,860
Go ahead.

171
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,060
Ran.

172
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,960
Let me hear your deduction.

173
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,630
So, that's my deduction.

174
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,330
I took everything into consideration,

175
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,230
I came to the conclusion that it's not shoplifting, a thief, or Aya.

176
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,030
Although it's hard to believe...

177
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,930
Well? Am I right?

178
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,230
Hey! I told you not to laugh.

179
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,330
Oh, sorry. It's not your deduction I'm laughing at.

180
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,930
I mean I couldn't help imagining you looking all troubled

181
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,130
after having deduced the situation as much as you have.

182
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,930
Huh? Then are you saying I'm right? Is my deduction correct?

183
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,030
I wonder.

184
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,630
Just what do you mean by that?

185
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,630
Don't be mean and tell me!

186
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,130
I'm not an over confident detective like somebody somewhere!

187
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,430
Don't be silly.

188
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,330
A detective is only human, and not some almighty god.

189
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,930
Huh?

190
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,830
When a detective reveals his deductions,

191
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,930
chances are that he carries doubts somewhere in his heart.

192
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,930
Like maybe, I left some detail out or overlooked something.

193
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,930
That's why when your deduction hits the bull's eye,

194
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,030
you feel more joy than anyone ever will!

195
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,930
I'm just thinking that I don't want

196
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,230
to take the best part away from you, Ran.

197
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,830
Shinichi.

198
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,030
He's putting on airs like he always does,

199
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,230
that "hubby" of yours.

200
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,630
If you think your deduction is correct, try it out.

201
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,630
Try it out?

202
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,830
You know? Come on, Ran.

203
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,430
There's a simple way to drag the culprit out before everybody.

204
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,230
Drag the culprit out.

205
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,530
If you were the culprit,

206
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,330
what situation would you hate to be in?

207
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,830
If I were the culprit?

208
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,030
Ran?

209
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,230
Mouri?

210
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,930
Welcome!

211
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,630
Excuse me.

212
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,130
Let me borrow your restroom!

213
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,130
Ran.

214
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,330
Shinichi.

215
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,530
Where's Ran?

216
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,030
The restroom.

217
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,230
Huh? The restroom?

218
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,630
Fire!

219
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,330
Quick, everybody! Run!

220
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,830
You'd better hurry, or you'll burn to death!

221
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,230
You'd better cut it out or I'll file charges against you

222
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,430
for interfering with business!

223
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,530
Listen, here.

224
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,630
What on earth's on your mind?

225
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,630
Hi.

226
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,630
No...

227
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,930
What...

228
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,930
-What's with him? -What's up?

229
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,630
So, it was you after all.

230
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,730
What?

231
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,730
Timid, office worker type customer.

232
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,830
Don't tell me it was him?

233
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,230
Yes, it's him!

234
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,930
He's the one who's been stealing stuff night after night

235
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,130
from this store and giving Aya a bad time!

236
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,830
Night after night? I was in front of the store watching last night too,

237
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,230
but I didn't see him sneak into the shop.

238
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,230
Of course, you didn't.

239
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,130
Because he was living in the attic of your store all this time!

240
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,130
What?

241
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,930
I can't believe it.

242
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,130
It may be hard to believe, but this is the truth.

243
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,930
After Aya closed the store,

244
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,730
he came out of the attic through the restroom

245
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,430
and sneaked into the store,

246
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,130
taking drinks and tons of food, and was making a living!

247
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,830
But Aya is in charge only 2 or 3 days a week and not everyday.

248
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,730
If he steals a lot at one time, he can probably last 2 to 3 days.

249
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,930
Then, why were games software and CDs also being stolen?

250
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,130
I think he was probably taking them out of the store occasionally

251
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,830
and selling them off for cash.

252
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,030
He'd have to go get a hair cut as well

253
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,830
as go to take a bath at the times,

254
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,130
otherwise his hair would grow long and he'd be smelly,

255
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,730
which would force him to stay in the attic

256
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,930
keeping him from coming out forever.

257
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,430
But, can he come in and out of that restroom

258
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,730
without the customers or the employees noticing him?

259
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,530
If he suddenly comes out of the restroom

260
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,530
or goes inside and doesn't come out,

261
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,330
he'll be suspected right away.

262
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,630
No problem! If he's hesitant and careful.

263
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,130
Because if he keeps letting people go before him

264
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,530
and keeps standing at the end of the line,

265
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,530
nobody would notice him going into the restroom,

266
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,230
so he wouldn't have to come back out, right?

267
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,730
Oh, I see.

268
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,230
If he comes down from the attic to the restroom

269
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,530
just before it starts getting crowded,

270
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,230
and comes out of the restroom after it gets crowded

271
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,330
and go into the store among the other customers,

272
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,530
he wouldn't risk being suspected.

273
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,430
If he'd been living in the attic for a while,

274
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,530
he would probably have had an idea

275
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,430
of when it would start getting crowded.

276
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,130
Besides, if the restroom starts getting crowded,

277
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,530
so would the store,

278
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,130
so the employees wouldn't possibly be able to remember

279
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,230
who came into the store and who went out, right?

280
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,030
Then the toothbrush set, batteries and shaver that he bought...

281
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,630
The batteries he used for the flashlight he used

282
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,330
when looking for stuff after the store closed!

283
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,530
All the other stuff he took to make himself look decent!

284
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,930
Besides, there's a mirror in the restroom too!

285
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,030
Shopkeeper! It's just as she says!

286
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,330
The board of the ceiling of the restroom is removed!

287
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,830
What?

288
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,930
Which mean he was hiding in the attic all this time, after all.

289
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,330
This place is a trash dump, shopkeeper!

290
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,930
-Incredible! -Oh my God.

291
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,730
But, why did he do it only on the days that Aya was in charge?

292
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,130
That's because Aya is a diligent worker!

293
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,930
The cardboard boxes that are left out on the corridor.

294
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,530
The other employees would leave the boxes stacked,

295
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,230
in other words, the restroom door was blocked,

296
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,830
so he couldn't come out.

297
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,430
But, Aya would organize them

298
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,130
and move them to both sides of the corridor,

299
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,630
making it possible for him to come out of the restroom

300
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,130
and go into the store!

301
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,330
But, Ran,

302
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,230
the boxes can be moved over with just a slight shove, can't they?

303
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,130
Exactly.

304
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,630
That's one thing I can't make out.

305
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,730
Hey.

306
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,330
Maybe he could've gone through the corridor if he moved the boxes.

307
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,130
If the employees find out that the boxes have been moved even slightly,

308
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,030
they might find out that the culprit walked through the corridor

309
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,130
and get suspicious.

310
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,930
They would suspect the restroom

311
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,830
and the fact that he's hiding in the attic may be discovered.

312
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,930
Since he was afraid of this happening, he couldn't make any moves.

313
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,930
-That's the story! -Right!

314
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,130
I see.

315
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,130
But, I still don't understand.

316
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,730
Huh?

317
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,730
Why did he stop stealing for a month?

318
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,830
Well, it may be that he was working things out with the cash

319
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,730
he got from selling off the games and all,

320
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,430
but if he didn't stop at that timing,

321
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,230
I wouldn't have suspected Aya as much as I did.

322
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,630
The culprit is probably a pretty nice person.

323
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,830
That's probably because he's a pretty good person.

324
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,430
That is, he heard Aya being scolded because of what he did

325
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,030
from the attic

326
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,430
and that's why he probably decided not to steal for a while.

327
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,230
I see! That's the story.

328
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,330
He stole only the lunches that were near the expiration date

329
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,030
because he wanted losses to the store to be as little as possible.

330
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,130
But stealing is stealing!

331
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,130
How dare you make Aya go through something like this?

332
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,830
Ran? Hey.

333
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,630
I could never forgive anyone who did something like this to Aya!

334
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,330
I'm so sorry!

335
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,330
Three months ago, I was fired from my company

336
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,830
and evicted from my apartment.

337
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,330
I walked into this store feeling faint from hunger.

338
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,830
But I didn't have money to buy anything.

339
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,530
The lights were turned off

340
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,230
while I was in the restroom at a loss what to do.

341
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,430
Even if I wanted to go out, the doors were locked

342
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,930
and I couldn't go out.

343
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,730
Once my eyes got used to the dark,

344
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,930
the thing that came bursting into my eyes

345
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,430
was the stack of food.

346
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,330
That's why you stole things from our store.

347
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,330
Yes. I figured since there was so much,

348
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,230
taking just a little wouldn't hurt.

349
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,530
You've gotta be kidding!

350
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,330
How much do you think we have to sell

351
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,930
in order to regain the amount you stole from us?

352
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,230
I'm really sorry!

353
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,430
Either way, you're going to pay us back for all the loss you cost us!

354
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,230
Even if I wanted to pay you back, I don't have a cent.

355
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,430
You're going to work here.

356
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,030
Although you'll have to work for free for a while to start with.

357
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,730
You're willing to hire me?

358
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,630
After all the trouble I caused you?

359
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,330
I quit being an office worker and started working here,

360
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,830
so I sort of understand how you feel!

361
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,230
Shopkeeper.

362
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,530
Thank you so much.

363
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,930
Do your best and work hard.

364
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,430
-Yes, sir. -Well...

365
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,930
I hate to be a wet blanket when you guys are getting it on but...

366
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,830
Will you please apologize to Aya?

367
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,630
Both of you!

368
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,430
I'm so sorry.

369
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,730
I'm very sorry, really. I'm sorry.

370
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,730
-I'm happy for you, Aya. -All is well!

371
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,430
Ran. Sonoko.

372
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,130
Thank you! Ran and Sonoko!

373
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,530
Nothing to it, just leave it to me.

374
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,230
Hey, woman detective!

375
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,030
Sorry, Shinichi, what was it you wanted to talk about?

376
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,730
Well, it's nothing much.

377
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,230
Did you come to my house recently?

378
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,030
Huh? No. Why?

379
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,330
Nothing. If not, it's okay.

380
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,930
-See you, then. -Oh, hey, Shinichi...

381
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,830
It's not Ran.

382
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,230
Yes. So, I'm going to sleep over at Jodie's place tonight.

383
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,930
Eat dinner at Cafe Poirot, okay, dad?

384
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,330
See you!

385
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,430
It's her little farewell party

386
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,830
and she gets wasted to the point of no return.

387
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,730
I'm sure she's relieved because she gets to go back to her country

388
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,030
after a long time.

389
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,930
Where are you going?

390
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,630
To the restroom.

391
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,630
Again. He helped me again.

392
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,330
It's so vexing.

393
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,430
Really vexing.

394
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,730
What on earth is this?

395
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,130
Pictures?

396
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,530
What's this?

397
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,830
Jodie...

398
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,130
Why? Jodie?
