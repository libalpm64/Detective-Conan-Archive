1
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,006
Hey, old man!

2
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,306
-Hurry up, will you! -That's interesting, right?

3
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:19,406
Come on and get going!

4
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:20,606
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,606
What a rough guy.

6
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,013
Purse snatcher! Somebody!

7
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:35,706
Catch him!

8
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,006
He's the guy we saw a while ago.

9
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:38,306
You mean he was a purse snatcher?

10
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,706
Stop!

11
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:43,806
Move it!

12
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:49,006
Watch out, boy!

13
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,029
Oh, no!

14
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:56,906
It hurts!

15
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:04,043
Sir?

16
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,047
I would like to ask you some questions over there.

17
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,306
You too, sir...

18
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:12,406
Wait, please!

19
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,059
What?

20
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,606
This...

21
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:30,906
After a while, we were released from police interrogation

22
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,906
and boarded the Tohto Loop Line again.

23
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,306
Look. I wonder if something's wrong?

24
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:42,806
At Sugame Station, three stations away,

25
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:45,306
an incident was already taking place.

26
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:07,106
Brooding over passing seasons

27
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:09,006
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

28
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,906
The true identity of a friend of justice

29
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:12,706
was an elderly man who tells picture stories?

30
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:14,406
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,115
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,506
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:48,207
"A Friend of Justice"

34
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:55,935
He's Kanemura, a wanted criminal.

35
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,235
He's member of the fraud group, right?

36
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,335
Yes.

37
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:02,847
By gaining the favor and trust of aged people living alone,

38
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,169
he introduces them to non-existent investment deals

39
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,569
and cheat large sums of cash from them.

40
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,469
Many of them committed suicide or running into bankruptcy.

41
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:12,669
Cause of death is?

42
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,233
A deadly blow on the forehead.

43
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,869
That's the only wound found on him.

44
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:20,969
-The culprit is really something. -What?

45
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,969
Because there seems to be no trace of any struggle.

46
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,469
Just to think that the culprit finished

47
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:27,369
this strong looking man in one blow.

48
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,469
What brings you both here?

49
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,669
We saw you from the train.

50
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,669
Come, Conan, we don't want to get in the way.

51
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,769
Come over here...

52
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,969
You're...

53
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:41,469
"Tokuma Norizuki (75)" -I saw you a while ago.

54
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:44,263
Do you know each other?

55
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:46,069
Yes, just a little bit.

56
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,869
But, what brings you here, sir?

57
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,769
He's an eye-witness to this crime.

58
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,275
-What? -Yeah, after I ran into you,

59
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:57,869
from inside the train,

60
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,769
I saw that man strike somebody with a stick.

61
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,569
So, I got off at Beika Station and went to the police box.

62
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,569
He's the leader of the fraud group,

63
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,287
Teruhiko Kiriya.

64
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,069
Could there have been a fall out?

65
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,291
"Teruhiko Kiriya (35)" -I've got nothing to do with this!

66
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,769
I was just taking a walk around here!

67
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,969
He witnessed it from inside the train?

68
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,569
But...

69
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,301
Sir, where's your cane?

70
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,269
I don't really need to use it, so I left it behind.

71
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:29,669
If I have it, everybody treats me like an elderly

72
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,313
and people are kind to me, so it's convenient, though.

73
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:38,317
The victim dies from one blow on the forehead.

74
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,469
This elderly man who says he witnessed it

75
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,769
from inside the train.

76
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,169
Maybe...

77
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,269
How many times do I have to tell you?

78
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,269
I'm not the one who did it!

79
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,069
Then, why were you near the scene of the crime?

80
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,369
I got a call.

81
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,869
From a guy who said he was an acquaintance of Kanemura.

82
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,969
I was told to come because Kanemura is waiting.

83
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:03,069
An acquaintance of the victim? Who is it?

84
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,369
Beats me. I've never heard his voice before.

85
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:09,069
Your story's hard to believe.

86
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,569
It's true! I...

87
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,969
I've been framed!

88
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,469
"Killing Between Comrades?"

89
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,169
A picture storyteller?

90
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,669
You mean, that elderly man?

91
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,969
Yeah. I heard when I was at the local police investigating another case.

92
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,365
It seems he's picture storytelling

93
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,269
to well-behaved children at Sazanka Park.

94
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,369
I see...

95
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,269
Well, the case seems to be coming to a close.

96
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,169
I guess there's nothing for a renowned detective to do at this point.

97
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,369
I hope it goes that way.

98
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:40,969
"The police of jurisdiction" -Yeah.

99
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,769
I did see Mr. Mouri here yesterday.

100
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,969
But I didn't know he was interested in this case.

101
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:52,391
At any rate, he says to please check on what I just told you.

102
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,769
Okay, I got it.

103
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,769
I'll directly take care of the rest.

104
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,769
Now, earth is mine!

105
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,169
No way, King of Darkness!

106
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,069
That voice, don't tell me it's...

107
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,969
Friend of Justice is here!

108
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,069
King of Darkness!

109
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,869
Time to face the punishment of justice!

110
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,969
Ran?

111
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,421
Take this!

112
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:27,269
Then, black light is emitted from the King of Darkness' cane!

113
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,431
Watch out! Friend of Justice!

114
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:33,669
Move it!

115
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,669
Show me too! Move it!

116
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,769
Hey! What's with you?

117
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,439
Anybody who comes late line up in the back!

118
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,169
Hey! Apologize before you cry!

119
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,969
It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult.

120
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,569
You need to follow the correct path of a man!

121
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:01,969
I'm... I'm sorry.

122
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,169
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,669
Okay, good boy.

124
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,969
Everybody, is it okay for him to watch the show with you?

125
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,469
Okay!

126
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:13,169
Then, let him be in the middle.

127
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:14,469
Thank you!

128
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,469
-Bye bye. -Bye bye.

129
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,069
-Thank you! -See you!

130
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,369
Take care of yourself!

131
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,483
It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult.

132
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,169
You scold them when you must.

133
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:31,069
But you need to have the kindness to forgive them too, don't you?

134
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,169
It's you, miss.

135
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,469
I forgot to thank you

136
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,069
despite you helping us when we were in danger yesterday.

137
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,769
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,969
I also didn't get to give this to you either.

139
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,503
Thank you!

140
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,369
Is Mitsu, your wife?

141
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,969
There was a time when I used to dream she was.

142
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:53,669
She passed away just the other day, because of an illness.

143
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,515
I'm sorry! I had no idea.

144
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,869
No... Did you come just to bring this to me?

145
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,269
No. I was just wondering why you left

146
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,869
without giving your name despite having caught a purse snatcher.

147
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:09,569
I didn't think that I needed to give my name

148
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:11,669
for just doing something like that.

149
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:15,969
But, you came up during the incident that happened later, right?

150
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,569
Why?

151
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:18,869
Conan!

152
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:20,869
Because it was a murder.

153
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:24,569
I just couldn't pretend not seeing what I did, son.

154
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:27,369
Then, why didn't you report it right away?

155
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,369
Why did you get off at Beika Station?

156
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,269
I don't have a cell phone,

157
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,269
and besides the station master was nowhere nearby.

158
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,369
You didn't get off part way, did you?

159
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,557
Yeah...

160
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,069
It didn't even cross my mind to.

161
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,969
Are you satisfied, son?

162
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:46,569
I'll be on my way then.

163
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,769
Thank you, miss.

164
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,069
Conan!

165
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,769
Good timing.

166
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,169
I found out about what Mr. Mouri wanted to check on.

167
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,713
About the victims of that fraud group,

168
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:10,035
some of them were friends of Mr. Norizuki.

169
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,035
-What? -What?

170
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:14,593
And, he seems to have 5-dan in kendo.

171
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,235
Please wait.

172
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:19,235
Does dad suspect that old man?

173
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:22,135
No. I wonder about that.

174
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,603
The culprit's been arrested already, right?

175
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:28,035
Yes but he's still denying that he did it.

176
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,335
I'll talk to dad!

177
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:32,135
Ran!

178
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:36,615
No! I've got to hurry and find out the truth.

179
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:41,535
Hey, there's one more thing Pops wants you to check on.

180
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,635
Again?

181
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:46,625
The scene of the crime is in between

182
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:50,629
this Natsuhabara Station and Beika Station.

183
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:52,631
It's near Sugame Station.

184
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,635
The surveillance camera?

185
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:01,035
Maybe I'll have Officer Takagi check on that too.

186
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,649
"Sugame Station"

187
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
This... This is?

188
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,669
Not there yet!

189
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,135
I see!

190
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:34,235
So, that's the story!

191
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,235
"The Mouri Detective Agency"

192
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:37,935
Come on, Dad, get up!

193
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:40,679
Wasn't the case coming to a close?

194
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,235
Why are you suspecting that old man?

195
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,683
I have no doubt!

196
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,135
What? Then, why...

197
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:50,435
I have no doubt that this beer is delicious.

198
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,035
Goodness!

199
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:56,695
I'm sure that the heaven's punished him!

200
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:00,699
"Witness A" -He brought a lot of suffering to many elderly people!

201
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,835
It was just mere punishment from the Friend of Justice!

202
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,435
Sir?

203
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:06,705
That's it for now.

204
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,707
Let's take it back to the studio.

205
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:11,235
No way...

206
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:12,711
Really?

207
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,719
"The police of jurisdiction" -Conan?

208
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,005
No, about that... It's probably going to take a while longer.

209
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,705
But, good timing.

210
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,505
We've just discovered a new fact,

211
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,729
so could you tell Mr. Mouri about it?

212
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,405
A new fact?

213
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,905
"Norizuki"

214
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:43,705
Excuse me.

215
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,751
Sir? Are you in?

216
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,505
Sir?

217
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,505
A diary?

218
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:03,105
What? There was another man who was a member of the fraud group?

219
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:06,765
Right. Takashi Motegi, 25 years old.

220
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:10,405
It seems that he cheated a large sum of money from a woman

221
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:13,505
who Mr. Norizuki was very close with.

222
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,705
We're trying to find out his whereabouts right now

223
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,405
but can't seem to find him.

224
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:18,777
Officer Takagi.

225
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,805
Can you give me the old man's address?

226
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:30,105
Ran?

227
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,005
"Takashi Motegi (25)"

228
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,105
Don't!

229
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:05,305
Stop already!

230
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:08,505
-Sir! -Miss...

231
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:15,705
I just couldn't believe what was going on.

232
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:20,105
So, I went to your house wanting to talk to you directly.

233
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:23,505
I'm sorry, I took the liberty to read it.

234
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:26,405
This is Mitsu's diary, isn't it?

235
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:29,705
And, I found what you wrote in it too, sir.

236
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,605
What the heck is this?

237
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,405
You're Takashi Motegi, aren't you?

238
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:36,605
Police!

239
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,905
We're taking protective custody of you.

240
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:38,857
What?

241
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,005
Police? Protective custody?

242
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:46,865
Since that elderly man over there is going after your life.

243
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,605
-Dad? -What?

244
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:53,205
That's right, isn't it, Inspector?

245
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:57,205
I heard you told Takagi to put him into protective custody.

246
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,205
What?

247
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,305
I don't remember saying something like that to Takagi...

248
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:10,889
Mr. Norizuki.

249
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,605
You can't deceive the eyes of this famed detective Kogoro Mouri.

250
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:18,897
You're the one who killed Mr. Kanemura yesterday, right?

251
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,405
Kogoro Mouri?

252
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:22,305
Just what do you think you're saying?

253
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,205
I'm the witness to that crime, you know?

254
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:29,305
I had my doubts about that from the beginning.

255
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:34,205
You said that you witnessed the crime from the train, however...

256
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,105
That overpass is a straight line,

257
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:39,905
so it's impossible to see the scene of the crime right below it!

258
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,921
Certainly.

259
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,605
-Takagi! -Yes, sir!

260
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,305
You mean this, right?

261
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:50,105
I had the contents of this IC ticket that I borrowed,

262
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:54,705
checked by the data management center of the Tohto Loop Line.

263
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,405
I had no reason to refuse lending it to you.

264
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:00,105
And, did you find anything?

265
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:02,605
Before and after the time of the crime yesterday,

266
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,405
entry to Natsuhabara Station was made at 1:35 pm.

267
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:07,805
Then, the record shows that at 2:15 pm,

268
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:11,205
this ticket was used to exit Beika Station.

269
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,205
It figures. Exactly.

270
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:17,505
-No, that's the strange part. -What?

271
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,805
There's nothing wrong about the entry.

272
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,961
The problem is the exit time.

273
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,963
Conan and Ran got off at Hatabata Station

274
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,965
because of the purse snatcher racket.

275
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
But you didn't get off.

276
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,305
Takagi, what time does that train arrive at Beika Station?

277
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,005
At 2:00 pm.

278
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,405
That's strange.

279
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:40,505
It's 15 minutes earlier than the record indicates.

280
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:42,305
Which means...

281
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:46,985
Right, he got off at Sugame Station and carried out his scheme!

282
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
Then he got on the next train.

283
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,605
So, that makes for the lost 15 minutes!

284
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,993
That's a very interesting story.

285
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:59,017
But if it's true, there should be a record of it, right?

286
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:03,738
No, there is no record of entry or exit at Sugame Station.

287
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:06,538
Then, why the 15 minutes discrepancy?

288
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:08,238
I'm embarrassed to say,

289
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:11,009
that being my age, I have to frequent the men's room.

290
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,838
So, I got off at Beika Station and ran to the men's room.

291
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,015
Therefore, it took me a while to exit Beika Station.

292
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,017
That's the truth.

293
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:23,021
The truth can be viewed on the camera of the station.

294
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
Are you talking about the surveillance camera?

295
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,738
I thought Sugame Station was under renovation

296
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,838
and there was no camera there.

297
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:32,038
So, you knew about it after all.

298
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,538
Isn't that the reason you decided to commit the crime there?

299
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:37,938
Another reason is that

300
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:40,238
there are many aged passengers that use that station,

301
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:42,838
so you wouldn't look that conspicuous there.

302
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,438
In other words, you called the victim out beforehand

303
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:49,047
to come under the overpass near Sugame Station

304
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,338
and got off the train without being taken by the camera.

305
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,138
You then attacked Kanemura.

306
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,638
And, boarded the train once more.

307
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,057
Then, you called Kiriya out to a place near the area,

308
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,538
so that he wouldn't have an alibi.

309
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,538
Then, how could I have got on and off the train

310
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:08,538
at Sugame Station without being recorded?

311
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:11,069
I had Officer Takagi check the images on the surveillance camera

312
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:14,038
of Natsuhabara Station.

313
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:16,338
The camera at Natsuhabara Station?

314
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:22,138
There was an image of Mr. Norizuki acting strange on the camera.

315
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:26,638
Back then, you entered the wicket with your IC pass,

316
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,738
but you backed out once and re-entered.

317
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:31,838
Why did you re-insert your pass?

318
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:37,095
I wasn't sure if I used the IC ticket correctly.

319
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,638
As you know, aged people aren't good with machines.

320
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:43,838
Isn't that exactly what you would like us to think?

321
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:45,438
Just what're you talking about?

322
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:48,838
Back then, along with your IC pass,

323
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,109
you had a ticket on you too!

324
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,038
A ticket?

325
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:58,438
He first scanned the IC ticket on the wicket machine,

326
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,738
and pretended to do it once more,

327
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,138
then he inserted the ticket

328
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:06,638
that he had hidden behind his IC pass.

329
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:10,038
When pushed by the purse snatcher, his hand touched the wicket.

330
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:13,131
He then retrieved the ticket that came out of the machine.

331
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:14,938
Then, he boarded the train,

332
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:18,138
and got off at Sugame Station to commit the crime!

333
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:20,938
Then he buys a ticket again and boards the train again.

334
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:22,438
At Beika Station,

335
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:27,145
he used the IC pass that he used at Natsuhabara Station and got off.

336
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,147
The ticket that you bought at Natsuhabara Station

337
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,738
was collected at Sugame Station, where you got off part way.

338
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,438
Your fingerprints should still be left on it.

339
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,038
You're really something, Mr. Detective.

340
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,738
But, I haven't done anything wrong.

341
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:46,338
He got what he asked for!

342
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,138
Punishment from justice!

343
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:49,438
No way!

344
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,438
Ran?

345
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:00,738
You scold when you have to scold,

346
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:05,183
but you had the kindness to forgive, sir.

347
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,138
Then, why?

348
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,738
Despite it all,

349
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:13,191
there are things that can't be forgiven.

350
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:14,838
Is it because Mitsu

351
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,838
passed away from the shock of being swindled?

352
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,838
Right. Exactly!

353
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:23,201
I found out that she'd been cheated

354
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,638
for the first time when I read her diary.

355
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,205
I couldn't forgive them!

356
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:32,538
So I took it upon myself to punish them for the sake of justice!

357
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:35,638
I understand how you feel.

358
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:38,138
But, it's not right!

359
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:41,219
If you read Mitsu's last words,

360
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,738
I'm sure you'd have realized!

361
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:45,838
Last words?

362
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,538
This is...

363
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:56,238
Mr. Friend of Justice taught me how to forgive people.

364
00:20:56,238 --> 00:21:01,238
That' why I will forgive the man who deceived me.

365
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:03,538
He was really nice to me,

366
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,245
who was living alone.

367
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,038
The smiles back then...

368
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,938
I can't believe that they were all untrue.

369
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:17,255
So, I'm going to believe that he will change his ways someday.

370
00:21:17,438 --> 00:21:20,838
I can't bear to die holding a grudge against someone.

371
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:24,538
Thank you, Mr. Friend of Justice.

372
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:26,738
I didn't know.

373
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:30,438
I was so enraged when I found out about Motegi and his gang.

374
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:33,938
I was completely blinded by hate!

375
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:36,238
Such a Friend of Justice, I am.

376
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:39,838
My eyes were clouded by the hate inside of me.

377
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:43,838
So I failed to realize how Mitsu really felt!

378
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:51,289
You mean, she forgave me?

379
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,038
And believed me?

380
00:21:56,838 --> 00:22:00,238
Just as Ran said, no matter what the reason,

381
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:02,738
there are things that shouldn't be done.

382
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,303
Not as a friend of justice...

383
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,038
Yes, as humans.

384
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:31,389
"Total confession" -Motegi confessed everything.

385
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,391
"Fraud group demolished" -Kiriya as a suspect of fraud

386
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,138
was arrested once again.

387
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,838
Please step back once and touch the scanner again.

388
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,638
What's the matter, dad?

389
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,738
I'll bet it's broken.

390
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:48,338
That's why "I see" nothing in ICs!

391
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:52,438
Hey, isn't that a rental video card?

392
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:54,338
What?

393
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:56,638
You're right.

394
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:59,938
Maybe you're the one who can't see most, Pops?

395
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,880
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,423
"Shoes"

397
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,056
Pops, you've got a job request from a water sprite.

398
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:09,427
A snatcher? Understood!

399
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,780
It's drunkard.
