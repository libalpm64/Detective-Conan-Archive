1
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,028
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:05,728
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:07,228
Here comes the popular series.

4
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:08,828
A coincidental meeting at a social gathering

5
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:10,728
brings commotion and halt to the love affair of a police officer!

6
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:12,128
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,828
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,428
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,738
I see. You can't come.

10
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:06,938
Too bad.

11
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:11,138
I'm sorry. Some urgent work suddenly came in.

12
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:13,938
Don't be. It's work so it can't be helped.

13
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:15,438
That's right.

14
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:18,538
Tell him not to drink too much, will you?

15
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,038
Because I'm not going to defend him

16
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:23,438
even if he gets drunk and hassles a young girl that is within his reach.

17
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:25,038
Okay, I will.

18
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,738
See you then, mom.

19
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,138
What's with that sigh of yours

20
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:38,338
just when we're about to dig in to delicious food?

21
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:39,638
Because...

22
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,338
Did you invite Aunty Eri to come?

23
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,138
Well, sort of.

24
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,238
I thought it was something like that.

25
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:52,038
When you suddenly said, "A fashionable cafe opened, so let's go."

26
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,038
I knew you had an ulterior motive.

27
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:55,538
Just as I thought.

28
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:56,938
No kidding.

29
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,238
I thought you were all for it,

30
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,238
saying that if it's delicious and inexpensive, let's go.

31
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:03,538
It was really tough getting reservations for this restaurant.

32
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:07,238
It's not all that bad a place,

33
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:10,338
but I'm sure that some young people use this place for socials and dates.

34
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,438
Huh? Mr. Mouri?

35
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:14,838
Hello!

36
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:16,138
Officer Chiba!

37
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:19,938
Officer Takagi is with you, too!

38
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,438
What's this?

39
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,338
Two men coming together to a restaurant like this to eat?

40
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,838
No!

41
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,238
We've come here for a social gathering!

42
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,338
Idiot! Shoots.

43
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:32,938
Social gathering? Does Officer Sato know of this?

44
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:37,538
Well, I'm just here to match the number of people who will be coming.

45
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,338
Rather, Officer Chiba dragged me over here.

46
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:41,438
Right? Isn't it?

47
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,638
Yeah.

48
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,738
Even thought that's true, when you say it that way

49
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,338
it sounds like you're lying.

50
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:49,338
So please don't tell Officer Sato about this.

51
00:03:54,138 --> 00:04:00,138
"Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 1)"

52
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:02,238
Okay, here goes. Another toast!

53
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,838
Chiba, you're late!

54
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:09,538
The girls are all here from sometime ago and have all started already.

55
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,138
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,638
Let me introduce you

57
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:15,438
to my friend from my junior high school days,

58
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:17,438
the leader of this social gathering, Emoto.

59
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:18,838
How do you do?

60
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,538
And he is?

61
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:23,838
This is Detective Mouri. I ran into him coincidentally.

62
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:26,138
I know!

63
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:27,838
The Sleeping Kogoro, right?

64
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:28,938
Hello.

65
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:32,338
And he's your friend, or rather...

66
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,138
Yeah, my colleague.

67
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:36,538
Nice to meet you, I'm Officer Takagi.

68
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:41,238
Not really sharp, but I guess it's better than nothing.

69
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:44,838
He may have a foul mouth, but he's a good guy inside.

70
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,738
Is that so...

71
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:50,438
You're lucky today, Chiba.

72
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:54,638
There are two cute girls among the girls who are here today.

73
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:03,438
I'm happy for you.

74
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:07,438
Is one of them your older sister who may be coming today?

75
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:09,238
No.

76
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:12,238
I was told that one of them is an old friend of my big sister

77
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:14,938
and the other one is the best friend of her friend.

78
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:17,338
They both seem to be working for the police force.

79
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:20,138
-Police force? -Police force?

80
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:21,338
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,938
you used to say that you wanted to be a police officer before.

82
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,738
What are you doing now?

83
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:29,438
I'm a police detective, a detective!

84
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:32,338
Which means that dorky one there is also a cop?

85
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:33,738
Yeah, right.

86
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,038
Then, you guys may have met

87
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,238
those mini skirt police women somewhere.

88
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:41,738
Mini skirt?

89
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:44,638
Are you sure those two really worked for the police force?

90
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:47,138
Yeah, this isn't TV.

91
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:53,238
Who cares because we can't really dress fashionably during work hours!

92
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,038
-Yumi? -Yumi?

93
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:02,338
Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba! What are you guys doing here?

94
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:05,238
Shoots. So you guys know each other after all.

95
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,638
Which means that...

96
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:09,638
The other woman is...

97
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:11,538
Yumi!

98
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,538
Hurry and come back.

99
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:16,338
I can't handle those guys alone.

100
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,138
Officer Sato,

101
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,938
what brings you here?

102
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,238
Officer Takagi? Officer Chiba, too?

103
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:24,738
And why are you guys here?

104
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:30,338
The atmosphere doesn't look too good, does it?

105
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,238
It's starting to get interesting.

106
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,738
Hey, Pops.

107
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:39,738
So with a moment's delay, I charged for the culprit like this...

108
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:41,638
And attacked his joints like this.

109
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:45,438
Please let me be the culprit next.

110
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,838
Just as expected of Officer Sato, she's caught the hearts of all the men.

111
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,738
More than that, the problem is that man.

112
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:57,738
You also solved the trick to the case the other day too, didn't you?

113
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,338
Tell us about it, tell us about it.

114
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:04,138
It was so easy that I forgot how I did it.

115
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:06,038
Don't be mean.

116
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:11,538
I guess I'll start heading home.

117
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,938
Hey, hey. What're you talking about?

118
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:16,138
This kind of time off doesn't come everyday, you know.

119
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:20,138
But I'm worried about Kouta who is staying home alone, too.

120
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,638
Is he your younger brother?

121
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:25,938
No. He's my cousin who's going to be five years old.

122
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:28,938
His parents are both on a business trip abroad,

123
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:32,638
so he's staying at our home for now.

124
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,338
He'll be fine.

125
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:36,838
You fixed his dinner before we came, didn't you?

126
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,238
Let's go all out today.

127
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:41,138
I've got work to do, too.

128
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:43,938
Why don't we forget about work just for today?

129
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:46,638
Your body occasionally needs time off, too.

130
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:47,838
Yes.

131
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,938
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:54,138
Officer Takagi!

133
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,638
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:56,638
No.

135
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:59,138
I really ought to be going home.

136
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:01,638
Because something strange happened just the other day.

137
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:03,138
Something strange?

138
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,138
Things to do with Kouta.

139
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:07,138
Like the Masked Yaiba battle card.

140
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,138
A battle card?

141
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:13,738
Yeah. One day, he brought his friends over and showed off his card,

142
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:16,338
saying it was a really rare card that I've never seen before.

143
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:19,238
He was saying that a kind man gave it to him.

144
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,538
He seems to have been a bearded man with long bangs,

145
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,538
who dropped his wallet right in front of Kouta.

146
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,838
When Kouta picked it up for him, Kouta was given that card in thanks.

147
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:33,038
Moreover, that man took Kouta to his residence and served him cake,

148
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,038
then asked him a lot of questions.

149
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,538
What was he asked?

150
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:38,738
According to Kouta,

151
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:40,638
that man is a fortune teller

152
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,138
and asked about the interior of the rooms of our house.

153
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:44,338
For example, about the position of the bed,

154
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,438
or what kinds of things there are at the entrance,

155
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,938
as well as the birthdays of my younger brother and I.

156
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,838
He also asked where the mails that are delivered are left.

157
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,438
Mails?

158
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:56,038
Kouta told him that I leave my mail in a box inside the closet

159
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:59,938
and that Masashi leaves his on his desk without putting them away.

160
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:04,638
He told Masashi that it is in a very good position so to leave it as is.

161
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:10,638
Was there anything important among the mails?

162
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,138
No, not as far as I know.

163
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:15,038
I have no idea either.

164
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:19,238
On top of that, it seems that the guy is a friend of mine, too.

165
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,438
Friend?

166
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:26,638
Maybe he's planning something to surprise me on my birthday.

167
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:28,838
How did you find out that he is your friend?

168
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,738
Kouta said there was a phone call while he was eating the cake.

169
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:37,338
The man happened to be in the bathroom, so the machine picked up.

170
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:40,238
Kouta says that the voice he heard was my voice,

171
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,138
so there's no doubt about it.

172
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,638
Then do you have any idea who he is?

173
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,038
Well...

174
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:49,838
I called here and there to gather members for this social gathering.

175
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,838
But I'm sure it's one of them.

176
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:57,338
The man who heard the message rushed Kouta back home.

177
00:09:57,338 --> 00:10:01,538
The guy probably panicked thinking that I would find out about him.

178
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:03,938
What was the message about?

179
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,738
Well, it was nothing really.

180
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,338
Just that my sister and I are having social gathering here today.

181
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:11,538
What was that?

182
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:15,338
Which means that the man knows that only the boy is at home tonight?

183
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,738
Please call him right away.

184
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:21,038
I tried several times but there's no answer,

185
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,238
so I figured I should head on home.

186
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,338
Yes, I think we should go check.

187
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,338
Yumi!

188
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:28,538
She's wasted.

189
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:29,538
Chiba!

190
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:31,738
Dad.

191
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,338
What is it?

192
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,538
Kouta!

193
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:43,438
Kouta!

194
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,338
You're taking it too seriously.

195
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:47,838
The door was locked, too.

196
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:52,338
That man was just asking about furniture placement and birthdays, right?

197
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,438
He could be a Feng Shui fortune teller or something.

198
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,238
That's what the problem is.

199
00:10:56,238 --> 00:11:00,138
There are still many people who use their birthdays to unlock their safes,

200
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:01,838
so that they won't forget it.

201
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:02,838
Right.

202
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,738
If he knows the position of the furniture beforehand,

203
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,438
it would be easier to find the safe.

204
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:08,538
Or it could be that he used the mails and postcards

205
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:10,838
as a hint to figure out the numbers to unlock the safe.

206
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,738
And if the culprit cannot find what he is after,

207
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:17,138
the next action he would take is...

208
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,538
Officer!

209
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,638
Please come!

210
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:23,638
Look at this.

211
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:25,438
"I have the boy who is your cousin! Prepare 1,000,000 yen!"

212
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:26,938
"I will contact you later! Blab to the police and I'll kill him!"

213
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,838
-This is... -This is...

214
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,138
A kidnapping.

215
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:41,424
I have the boy. Don't call the police.

216
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,124
You're cops, aren't you?

217
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,824
That's true.

218
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:47,524
Well, I guess it's saving us needless energy.

219
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,724
At any rate, let's get support from headquarters.

220
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,024
No.

221
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:53,824
The culprit came in here and took Kouta away.

222
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:56,424
He could still be nearby checking things out.

223
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,824
If any more cops stampede in here, it would be too conspicuous.

224
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,624
Don't use cell phones either because the waves are easily picked up.

225
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:05,824
Contacting the police will only be after we confirm

226
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,324
that there are no wiretaps or the like.

227
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,824
That's the basics!

228
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:10,924
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,824
I'm sorry I got carried away.

230
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:14,524
No, don't be.

231
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:18,324
The culprit met Kouta once,

232
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:21,324
and is probably Mr. Emoto's friend, right?

233
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,124
Yeah.

234
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:26,924
Then, if you tell Pops about the details back then,

235
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:29,624
he might be able to figure out who the culprit is.

236
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,924
Well, I guess so.

237
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:36,424
If I remember correctly, it was Saturday a week ago, wasn't it?

238
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:37,424
Yes.

239
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:42,724
Kouta was out playing that day and came home a little after 8pm.

240
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:43,724
8pm?

241
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:46,024
That's pretty late, isn't it?

242
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:50,224
Yes. I was worried and thought of contacting the police.

243
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:55,124
But he came home looking fine and said,

244
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:59,524
"I'm sorry. I'll never do it again so don't tell my parents."

245
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,824
So I didn't scold him much.

246
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:05,024
But I had no idea that he was meeting someone so dangerous.

247
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:08,224
He probably dropped his wallet on purpose and made Kouta pick it up.

248
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,924
He then took Kouta to his house.

249
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,724
It was then that I happened to leave my message in his answer phone,

250
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:15,524
saying that we'll be holding social gathering

251
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:19,024
inviting my big sister and her friends.

252
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,124
I see.

253
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:24,824
It seems certain that the kidnapper is a friend of Masashi.

254
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:30,124
He probably asked Kouta about the position of the furniture in the house

255
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:33,324
and broke into the house tonight when both of you weren't home.

256
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:36,124
Do you have any safe in this house?

257
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:38,424
We have nothing fancy like a safe.

258
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:41,024
We also carry around our bank books and bank cards,

259
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:45,224
so we really have nothing here that is worth stealing. Right?

260
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,424
Yeah.

261
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,724
In other words, the culprit came into the house,

262
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:52,224
but didn't find anything worth stealing.

263
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:55,124
So he kidnapped Kouta instead.

264
00:13:55,124 --> 00:13:58,524
And of the people that you invited to the social gathering,

265
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,524
do you know who couldn't make it tonight?

266
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:03,224
Yeah, there are three.

267
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:06,824
The first is Takuji Rokuda, a friend of mine since my childhood days.

268
00:14:06,824 --> 00:14:10,024
The second is an under classman in my high school days called Hikiya.

269
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:14,224
And the third is a man who patronizes the gym that I work for, Mr. Satsuka.

270
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:16,724
All three of them are not bad people.

271
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,524
I can't imagine them kidnapping anyone.

272
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,424
Do you remember what time you called those three people?

273
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,924
I called Rokuda a little after noon.

274
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:25,824
I called Hikiya in the evening.

275
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,524
And Mr. Satsuka at around 7pm.

276
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,924
All three of them were called during the time that Kouta was out.

277
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:35,424
That is before noon to 8:00 at night.

278
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:40,124
There's one thing that bothers me though.

279
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:43,124
If the culprit made such complex preparations,

280
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:46,824
I'd figure he'd steal something deemed valuable.

281
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:52,724
True. If he wanted to kidnap Kouta, he could've done so two weeks ago.

282
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:56,524
That man was concerned about your mail, wasn't he?

283
00:14:56,524 --> 00:15:00,024
Did you have any important mails or documents?

284
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,924
Nothing really that I know of.

285
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:04,424
Post card!

286
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:07,224
That's right! It's the New Year's special prize post card!

287
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:10,124
I'm sure the first prize for this year was a trip to Hawaii.

288
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,324
If he sells it at a ticket cash exchange shop,

289
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,024
it would add up to quite a sum.

290
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:17,124
He probably took down the names

291
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,224
and the post card numbers of the people he sent post cards out to and...

292
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:23,724
Here. These are the New Year's cards that came from those three.

293
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,024
They all won no prize though.

294
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,524
Are you sure?

295
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:32,724
Yes. Because I checked all the post cards we received.

296
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,824
Right.

297
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:37,024
Because unlike me, she's all into prizes and lotteries.

298
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:41,924
Talk for yourself. You go around collecting game cards just like a kid.

299
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,224
Collect cards?

300
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:47,424
Just like Kouta, I used to collect Masked Yaiba cards since I was a kid,

301
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:51,424
and still do even now.

302
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:52,624
I see.

303
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:55,624
That's why he knew that the card Kouta received was a rare card.

304
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,424
Well, if you suspect my friends,

305
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,724
1why don't we go over to their house?

306
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:05,824
All three of them should be home because they cancelled the gathering

307
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,224
saying they had something to do at home today.

308
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:12,024
Good idea. Since they're all suspects, let's go and check.

309
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:13,824
But what if he finds out that you're police officers?

310
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:17,424
We're going to act as if we stopped by on our way back from the gathering,

311
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:19,224
and we'll keep that we came here a secret.

312
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:23,224
And if the culprit makes any false moves, we'll nab him on the spot.

313
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:26,124
If the person's not home, he's the culprit.

314
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:29,024
I'm sure that Detective Mouri's face is already known,

315
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:32,424
so please wait here for contact from the culprit together with Aya and Ran.

316
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,824
Okay.

317
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:34,924
What about Conan?

318
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,824
Yes, I'll take him with me.

319
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:41,024
Because he notices a lot of things,

320
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:43,024
and I'm sure he'll throw the culprit off his guard.

321
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,724
Here it is!

322
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,224
Room 203.

323
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,524
Is this the first time you've come here?

324
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,024
Yeah, it's the first time to come all the way to his room.

325
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,124
Who is it?

326
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,324
It's me, Emoto.

327
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,324
I dropped by on my way back from the social gathering.

328
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,424
May I talk with you for a minute?

329
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,624
What is it at a time like this?

330
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:15,924
Sorry, sorry.

331
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:19,124
I talked about you at the social gathering and these two...

332
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:21,924
"Takuji Rokuda (26)" -You guys wanted to see me. Why?

333
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:24,824
Well, we also play in a band!

334
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:29,724
But recently his lyrics don't match my melody.

335
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:34,124
I want to hear your songs.

336
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:37,724
This is Conan. Nice to meet you!

337
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,024
Is he your son?

338
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,124
He's my younger brother!

339
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:55,124
You're pretty good.

340
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,224
Yeah.

341
00:17:57,824 --> 00:18:01,524
By the way, what are all these lottery tickets?

342
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:04,624
They're the year-end lottery tickets that I sent to you.

343
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:06,524
You'd better check them out good.

344
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:09,124
It's okay. I'll bet none of them are winning tickets anyway.

345
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:12,924
If you have money to buy so many lottery tickets,

346
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:15,224
why don't you get yourself a better room?

347
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:20,924
Maybe there's something good in that bulging mailbox of yours.

348
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,624
Yeah.

349
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,724
Amazing, amazing!

350
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,724
It looks a lot like Chiba's room.

351
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:38,124
I always wanted to be a model, so this is fantastic!

352
00:18:38,124 --> 00:18:39,324
"Kadonari Hikiya (25)"

353
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:43,024
How flattering to be complimented by a beauty character like you.

354
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:44,124
So she's only a character to you.

355
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,624
I should've gone to the social gathering, too.

356
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:49,224
That's why I invited you quite persistently.

357
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:52,424
By the way, what was inside the limited edition event pack

358
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,424
of Masked Yaiba cards you asked me to buy and send you?

359
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:59,224
All of them were worth nothing.

360
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:00,224
How about you?

361
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,524
Me, too.

362
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:05,924
The super rare Potato Queen platinum card wasn't inside.

363
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:08,924
What's the limited edition event pack?

364
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:12,424
It was a one day thing where you could only buy two packs.

365
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:13,924
It's rumoured that among the seven cards inside,

366
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:18,424
a super rare card that is no longer sold may be included.

367
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:22,024
The price for those can go over almost 800,000 yen on internet auctions.

368
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,224
-800,000 yen? -800,000 yen?

369
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:27,024
Well, cards and figurines are good, too.

370
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:31,024
But, Hikiya, I'd advise you to look at real women occasionally.

371
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,424
Amazing, amazing!

372
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:42,124
I always admired old-time money so much.

373
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:44,024
I'm so overwhelmed.

374
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:45,524
But it's sort of obvious that you're acting it out.

375
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:46,624
"Yoshikane Satsuka (31)"

376
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:50,624
Which means you have some things like these, too?

377
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,424
No, nothing much.

378
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,524
Just stuff like a 10,000 yen Taishi bill

379
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:58,924
that have the end numbers 385 (Miwako) which is a homonym of my name.

380
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,724
Well, you should keep that safe without spending it.

381
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:06,124
Although it has no special value.

382
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:07,724
I thought so.

383
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:10,924
Something of value is here, take a look.

384
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:12,824
Fantastic!

385
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:15,624
The numbers are all matched.

386
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:20,424
You keep buying those rare bills despite going into debt,

387
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,624
that's why your wife runs out on you.

388
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:25,624
Sorry about last time.

389
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,724
I sent the 30,000 yen that I borrowed from you with the docs.

390
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:29,924
Did you get it?

391
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,624
Yeah, I did.

392
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:34,024
More importantly, you should start eating properly

393
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,624
and come to our gym again.

394
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,724
You looked like you have lost a lot of weight.

395
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:40,424
I suppose so.

396
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,924
So? There are no suspicious ones among them, are they?

397
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,424
Well, there was no man with long hair and a beard.

398
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:54,624
I'm sure the man was disguised to hide his face from Kouta.

399
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:57,824
You still suspect them? Give me a break.

400
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:01,424
Kouta was nowhere in the room of the three, was he?

401
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:05,824
Maybe the voice on the answer phone was of somebody who sounded like me?

402
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,024
It's from my sister.

403
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:12,724
Don't tell me the culprit contacted her.

404
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:13,724
Lend me your phone!

405
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,124
Hello, what's up?

406
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:18,124
No, nothing yet.

407
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:21,324
But something that Kouta was saying bothers me.

408
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:23,024
What is it?

409
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,624
Something about the characteristics of the culprit?

410
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:28,924
No. It's just that when he ate cake at that person's house,

411
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,224
a baseball game seems to have been playing on TV.

412
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,824
He said...

413
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,224
It was a super boring game.

414
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:38,024
Super boring game?

415
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,724
Baseball games playing this season

416
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:40,924
are either high school baseball games

417
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,424
or the opening games for professional baseball!

418
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:47,124
Let's have investigators watch the houses of the three,

419
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:50,224
while we check on the baseball games that were played that day.

420
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,924
Maybe we'll be able to grab clues of the suspect.

421
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,324
Hey!

422
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:56,524
Do you have to go as far as to make investigators watch them?

423
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,124
It could be that somebody is really just playing a prank.

424
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:01,924
Kouta could even come home.

425
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:03,824
How can you be so carefree?

426
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,624
A child's been kidnapped!

427
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,024
Abducted!

428
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,924
It's nothing close to a prank!

429
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:12,324
Yeah, I guess so.

430
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,560
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,780
"A complete game"

432
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,120
Do you often go to social gathering, Officer Sato?

433
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,640
-What's with you, at a time like this? -Well...
