1
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:03,983
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,437
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:07,137
And start the countdown to deduction and the future!

4
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:09,737
Lawyer Eri Kisaki and renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

5
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:11,637
The confrontation of destiny of a separated couple.

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,037
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:14,737
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:16,737
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:03,054
On our way to pick up Attorney at Law Eri Kisaki, Ran's mother,

10
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,054
in order to go to dinner together,

11
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:09,354
we discover the dead body of a popular wrestler, Mr. Shiro Eisaku.

12
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,754
From what's seen of the dead body,

13
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,454
it seems that he had been killed

14
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:18,117
while getting a hair cut at a barber or a beauty shop.

15
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:20,119
It turns out that Ms. Minayo Hasaka

16
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,121
"Minayo Hasaka (29)" -who runs a beauty salon in the neighbourhood

17
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,254
used to be Mr. Eisaku's ex-girlfriend,

18
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,754
so she ends up being one of the suspects.

19
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:29,354
However, at the estimated time,

20
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:30,854
the murder was thought to have been committed,

21
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:34,133
Minayo happens to be doing Eri's hair.

22
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,135
Besides, if Minayo were to be the killer,

23
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,654
how could she have moved a dead body weighing 90 kilograms

24
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:40,154
to the trash dump?

25
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:44,154
And, what were the three sounds "crash, thud and rattle-rattle"

26
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:48,754
that we heard when the dead body was found?

27
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:57,654
"Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony (Part 2)"

28
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,754
Conan!

29
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,854
Everybody's leaving, let's go too!

30
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:04,163
Okay!

31
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,754
What're those desks and chairs?

32
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:19,954
Maybe over-sized items that are to be disposed of are gathered there,

33
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,354
so that they can be picked up

34
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:24,183
during the next over-sized items trash collection day?

35
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:27,954
Minayo sure is scrupulous, isn't she?

36
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,354
Because, look...

37
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:32,654
She has the old newspapers and magazines all separated,

38
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:36,195
and all the cardboard boxes are nicely folded compactly and tied together.

39
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,554
Come on, let's go!

40
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:39,154
Okay!

41
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:48,854
Why...

42
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,954
You drove through this narrow back road on your scooter?

43
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,954
Yes. There's usually nobody here, so...

44
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,219
What's with him calling me repeatedly?

45
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,354
-Don't you have to answer the call? -Huh?

46
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:07,554
I'll bet it's one of your beautiful woman childhood friends.

47
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:09,254
Yeah, sorry, so what!

48
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:12,754
Oh boy! Why does it always turn out like this?

49
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,235
It's the convenience store over there.

50
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:24,243
It's opposite the trash dump where the body was found.

51
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,247
The traffic sign pole...

52
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:31,354
It's dusted off and there are thin lines on it.

53
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,354
What are these lines?

54
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:39,354
Cigarette butts and trash are collected in one place.

55
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,261
Why?

56
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,954
Is this the place?

57
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,854
The trash dump next to the convenience store

58
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:52,271
that you came to throw out your trash?

59
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,854
Yes.

60
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:56,954
What do you guys want?

61
00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:58,954
You work for this convenience store?

62
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,054
Yes.

63
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,554
We're the police.

64
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,254
Huh? The police?

65
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:09,554
Just a while ago, I heard that something happened in the neighbourhood.

66
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:11,554
Yes. Regarding that incident,

67
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:15,154
I wonder if you can tell me what time she came here tonight?

68
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:18,654
Huh? What is this? Are they suspecting you, Minayo?

69
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:22,754
-Yes. -Well, we're just confirming things.

70
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:27,554
I think it was at about 20:30.

71
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:30,309
I guess I can check the receipt and tell you for sure!

72
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,654
Because Minayo's the only customer who bought a bag of rice tonight!

73
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,654
It says 20:28.

74
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:44,323
Do you know how long she was here back then?

75
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,854
About 4 to 5 minutes, I think.

76
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,554
I guess we can check the surveillance camera.

77
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:53,954
Then, I guess she couldn't have committed the murder after all.

78
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:58,337
She left me saying that she had something to do at 20:20.

79
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,854
After doing what she had to do, she came back at 20:30.

80
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:06,345
She came to this convenience store between 20:23 to 20:24,

81
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:09,954
If she left after finishing shopping at 20:28...

82
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,454
The time she could've used to commit the crime

83
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,154
would be 3 to 4 minutes before going to the convenience store

84
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,054
and 2 minutes after leaving the store.

85
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:22,154
It's too short a time to carry the dead body over to the trash dump!

86
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,754
When she came here tonight,

87
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,254
she was carrying a trash bag, wasn't she?

88
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:31,754
Yes, 2 to 3 bags.

89
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:35,554
Maybe one of the bags had a dead body in it, and not trash?

90
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,375
Dead body?

91
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:38,854
Please, dear...

92
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:40,654
No, I guess you want to say that

93
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:43,954
she carried the dead body over with the scooter, but that's not possible!

94
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:45,054
Impossible?

95
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,754
Because Minayo's scooter is so junk

96
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:51,854
that the engine stopped before she came to the store!

97
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:53,554
-It stopped? -Yes.

98
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:57,954
Just when I went out to throw out the trash, in front of the store.

99
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:59,754
Just as Minayo was coming out of the back road

100
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,554
where her house is to where she came out to this road just about here.

101
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,954
I saw it jerk to a halt!

102
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,405
After that, you got off your scooter

103
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,254
and came here pushing it along, right?

104
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,411
Yes. But it started to move after a while,

105
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,413
so I drove it back home.

106
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,554
Now you know, that she's not the one!

107
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,054
She's my precious beautician,

108
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:22,754
so will you please stop hassling her?

109
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,154
Right, good work.

110
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,429
Protect me good, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

111
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:35,454
Huh? There's blonde hair stuck by your stomach, Miss!

112
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:38,437
No... no way?

113
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,654
I made sure I changed clothes.

114
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:44,443
Another good look and it's brown hair!

115
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,854
It's Ms. Kisaki's hair!

116
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:49,754
Yes.

117
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:51,554
The way she just reacted...

118
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,453
She's the killer after all.

119
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,454
But I can't figure it out.

120
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:58,457
From Minayo's beauty shop

121
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,454
to the trash dump where the dead body was found,

122
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,654
it's true that it's very close if in a straight line.

123
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:06,054
But she went shopping at the convenience store

124
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:09,154
that's opposite the trash dump.

125
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:13,454
If so, the time left for her to commit the crime is really slight.

126
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:15,554
With just so little time left, how did she move

127
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:18,477
the body of a man who weighs 90 kilograms?

128
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,954
You're hurt after all!

129
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,254
Hurt?

130
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:28,054
I wonder where I got hurt?

131
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:31,654
Remember, when dad slammed on the brakes...

132
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,754
I get it! Sudden braking!

133
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,554
If my deduction is correct,

134
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,554
it should be somewhere here.

135
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,854
Just as I thought, after all.

136
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:02,054
I've figured everything out!

137
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:07,254
A dreadful trick that sent a man on a death...

138
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,554
plunge to the pits of hell!

139
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,537
Not again.

140
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,754
Like I've been saying for some time already.

141
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:24,543
Ms. Hasaka couldn't have committed the crime!

142
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:26,554
But, Ms. Kisaki...

143
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:31,454
The fact that Ms. Hasaka was not with you between 20:10 to 20:30

144
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,454
which is the estimated time of death,

145
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,354
for some reason really bothers me.

146
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:41,854
Right, right. Ms. Hasaka is after all his ex-girlfriend, too.

147
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:45,054
That's irrelevant right now, isn't it?

148
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,854
The image on the surveillance camera also shows that

149
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:53,554
she was unmistakably in the shop for 4 minutes between 20:24 and 20:28.

150
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:55,454
The only time she had to commit the crime

151
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:58,577
was 4 minutes from 20:20 to 20:24

152
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:01,754
and 2 minutes from 20:28 to 20:30!

153
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:04,054
Just how do you propose that she carry

154
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:08,054
the dead body of a man who weighs 90 kilograms

155
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:10,589
to the trash dump that is two slopes below?

156
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,354
Or, is it that you're giving her a hard time

157
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:16,354
because she's my beautician?

158
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:19,354
Don't be ridiculous!

159
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,054
Hey, mom!

160
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,154
You're taking it a bit too far!

161
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:34,613
Dad actually came here today to come pick you up, you know?

162
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:38,054
I knew that to begin with.

163
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:41,654
Then, why?

164
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:44,623
It just annoys me that,

165
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,954
that guy doesn't bother to say a word about it to me!

166
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:51,454
Then, why didn't you ask him yourself and say,

167
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:54,354
"Did you come to pick me up?"

168
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,354
What're you talking about?

169
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,654
Are you telling me to win the favor of that mustached chauvinist?

170
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:02,254
No way!

171
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:04,254
Gosh.

172
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:07,754
-Ms. Hasaka. -Yes.

173
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:12,154
May I have your permission to check inside your house, just to be sure?

174
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,653
What? But...

175
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,654
No way!

176
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,354
Under Article 35 of the Constitution!

177
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:21,954
The right of all persons to be secure

178
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,854
in their homes, papers and effects against entries,

179
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:28,654
searches and seizures shall not be impaired,

180
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:33,954
except upon warrant issued for adequate cause

181
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:40,154
and particularly describing the place to be searched and things to be seized!

182
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,354
If you insist on investigating,

183
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:45,754
please do so after getting an arrest, search or seizure warrant

184
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,454
from a competent judicial officer, will you?

185
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,689
But...

186
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:52,454
Well, with circumstances showing that

187
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:53,754
she couldn't have committed the murder,

188
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,695
it would be hard to get what's needed though.

189
00:11:56,854 --> 00:12:01,454
Good. Very well done, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

190
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,754
I was perfectly correct

191
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:07,154
in choosing you as the one to testify my alibi.

192
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:10,709
Okay, you want me to prove it?

193
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,654
That she too, could've committed the murder.

194
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,454
My, you sure sound like you're ready to prove it?

195
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:25,054
Oh, no, well, it's not me, you see...

196
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,454
-It's... -Come!

197
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,054
-Sleeping Kogoro! -Sleeping Kogoro!

198
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:45,954
I'm glad I had Dr. Agasa make me a spare voice changer bow-tie.

199
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,754
Hold it!

200
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:51,654
Didn't you just say, "It's not me" or something like that?

201
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:55,354
So... I was going to say,

202
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:58,757
it doesn't have to be me explain this super simple trick!

203
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,254
The simple trick that Ms. Hasaka used, first killing Mr. Eisaku

204
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:05,654
then throwing him out in the trash dump two slopes below!

205
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,543
Inspector!

206
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,543
Will you please get ready a strong fishing line used for big catch

207
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:21,443
as well as cement bags that can be used as substitute for the victim?

208
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:24,543
-Officer Takagi, get them ready, will you? -Yes, sir!

209
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:29,143
And before we start, please take some pictures first.

210
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,443
Some pictures?

211
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,843
Take a picture of the stand of the guard rail

212
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,443
right above the trash dump where the body was found

213
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:39,843
and the tiny thin lines that are on the pillar of the traffic sign

214
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:43,743
that is around the corner on the way to the convenience store,

215
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:46,143
as well as the little amount of trash that is gathered in a circle

216
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:48,807
on the road near the traffic sign!

217
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:57,543
Mr. Mouri, everything's ready.

218
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,643
Let's begin, then.

219
00:13:59,643 --> 00:14:04,043
First, please put down the chair that is on the desk over there.

220
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,843
The first thing that bothered me was that chair.

221
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:13,943
The height of the chair is set as the highest it can go.

222
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,643
Yes, true.

223
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,837
Minayo seems to be a scrupulous character

224
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,243
judging from the way she separates old newspapers

225
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:21,743
and old magazines like they should be,

226
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:24,843
as well as folds cardboard boxes compactly and ties them together.

227
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,543
Nonetheless, it bothered me that

228
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:31,243
only that chair was left as is, at its highest position.

229
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:34,343
I guess I just happened to overlook it.

230
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:37,343
No! In order to make your trick work,

231
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,643
you needed to keep the chair at its highest position!

232
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:44,443
I'll redo the trick for you right now!

233
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:46,865
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

234
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,867
First, tie the fishing line that you got ready

235
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,143
onto the spindle of the chair!

236
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:52,143
Make sure you tie it on tightly

237
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,873
so that it doesn't come off even after pulling on it!

238
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,243
Next pass the tip of the line

239
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,743
through the other side of the pillar of the guard rail

240
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,943
where the trash dump where the dead body was found

241
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,343
is in view right ahead below and come back.

242
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,943
Then adjust the length of the line from the chair to the guard rail

243
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:15,343
to almost the same as the distance from the back of the beauty salon

244
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:18,143
to the road where the convenience store is,

245
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:22,443
and tie it on to the scooter that is parked at the backdoor.

246
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:23,649
All done!

247
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,853
Then, please tie another line to the back of the scooter,

248
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:29,553
but this time, make the length of the line

249
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,653
a little longer than the distance

250
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:34,153
from the guard rail to the road leading out to the convenience store

251
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:36,915
and tie it on to the spindle of the chair.

252
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:39,453
Then finally place the bags of cement on the chair

253
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,153
as substitute for the dead body and all is set!

254
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,453
All that's left to do is

255
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,925
to head for the convenience store on that scooter.

256
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:51,953
Hey, are you ready over on that side?

257
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:52,953
Yes, sir!

258
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,153
Just as you ordered, all the onlookers have been evacuated!

259
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,753
Okay, I got it!

260
00:15:57,753 --> 00:15:59,653
Officer Takagi!

261
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,653
Yes, sir!

262
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:04,353
At first, go slow so that the cement bag doesn't fall off

263
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,553
and gradually accelerate!

264
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:08,253
All right, sir!

265
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,453
Inspector Megure!

266
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:32,971
The cement bag fell into the trash dump!

267
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,453
Okay!

268
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,553
If the chair crashes into the guard rail with force,

269
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:40,053
through the law of inertia,

270
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:42,453
the dead body that is on the chair should fly off

271
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:46,253
and fall into the trash dump two slopes below.

272
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:48,053
Then from the impact of the crash,

273
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,053
the first line that was tied is severed.

274
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:54,153
If the scooter is pushed as is, all the way to the convenience store,

275
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:56,995
the chair is pulled with the line that was tied on later

276
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,353
and is returned to the back road where it was to begin with.

277
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,753
The law of inertia...

278
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:09,853
So, the crash, thud and rattle-rattling sounds that we heard were these.

279
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,653
The thin lines on the guard rail and the traffic sign were marks

280
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:17,015
left behind by the line scrapping against them.

281
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,153
But if the dead body were to be seated on the chair,

282
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,153
wouldn't its legs be sandwiched between the guard rail

283
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:24,053
so that it wouldn't fly all that far?

284
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,753
In order for that not to happen,

285
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,027
the victim was probably seated cross-legged.

286
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,029
The seat was probably adjusted to the highest possible position

287
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:35,033
to avoid the dead body from getting stuck by the guard rail.

288
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:38,353
Then, what about the trash that was gathered in a circle on the road?

289
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:41,039
When Minayo came back from the convenience store,

290
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,041
the line that she was dragging along scrapped

291
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,853
and gathered the trash on the road.

292
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:48,253
The scooter stopped moving suddenly

293
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:53,051
because the chair bumped into the guard rail causing it to stop.

294
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,653
Do you have proof?

295
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:57,753
Proof that I killed him!

296
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,953
It's so rude to treat me as if I were a killer

297
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,553
despite having no proof.

298
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,753
Isn't it, Ms. Kisaki?

299
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,753
The evidence is most probably...

300
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:15,073
Oh no! He got up at the worst timing!

301
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:20,753
And, where's the proof?

302
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,053
Proof?

303
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,753
Civil Code Article 239!

304
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:26,453
Ownership of movables without an owner

305
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:31,753
shall be acquired by possessing the same with the intention to own!

306
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:34,853
In other words, trash that is once thrown into the trash dump

307
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:39,953
becomes the possession of whoever finds the trash necessary.

308
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,653
Maybe if we have them check the trash

309
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,101
that you threw out on the way to the convenience store,

310
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,103
everything will come to light?

311
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,653
If you're the killer, you would most probably want to

312
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,853
dispose of the blood smeared cape and towel

313
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:54,553
as soon as you possibly can, right?

314
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:02,753
Judging from the looks of it,

315
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:05,453
I don't think we need to do further checking.

316
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:07,125
It's so sad

317
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,853
to think that you would use me to establish your alibi.

318
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:16,553
You probably called Mr. Eisaku over to your house before I came,

319
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,753
and used the 10 minutes that was needed

320
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:22,453
to set the dye into my hair to kill Mr. Eisaku.

321
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,253
Then you used the trick explained just now

322
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:26,753
to throw the dead body over.

323
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:29,453
When you retrieved the line,

324
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,149
you forgot to adjust the height of the chair

325
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,953
to its original low position, in your haste.

326
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:36,553
You threw the dead body into the trash dump

327
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:38,453
because you wanted someone to find it quickly,

328
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:42,853
so that the span of the estimated time of death wouldn't be too great.

329
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:46,253
You held that bad a grudge against Mr. Eisaku, eh?

330
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,167
I don't hate him that much.

331
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:53,553
I hated the RV talent who got engaged to him.

332
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:55,453
She had the nerve to lure him into having an engagement with her

333
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:56,953
during the time that he and I were having a fight

334
00:19:56,953 --> 00:20:00,553
and decided not to see each other for a while. It's her that I hate!

335
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:02,953
Then, why did you kill him?

336
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,453
Do you know?

337
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:09,187
When he first debut as a wrestler, he had short black hair.

338
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:10,653
That woman's the one who changed his hair

339
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:12,953
to blonde medium length hair.

340
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:15,453
I just couldn't stand myself

341
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:20,353
doing as that woman ordered.

342
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,201
I couldn't stand him watching contentedly

343
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,203
while she did as she pleased.

344
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,853
You should've refused then.

345
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,453
When I became a beautician,

346
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:33,853
I promised that I would cut his hair through his entire life!

347
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:37,953
Yes. I didn't want to let anyone cut his hair.

348
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:40,353
Nor, did I want to cut his hair myself either.

349
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:43,221
So, I had no choice but to do what I did.

350
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,953
Well, we'll hear the rest of your story at the Police Department.

351
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,053
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

352
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:02,853
Ms. Kisaki, you'd better be careful too.

353
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:05,753
You're fighting with him over trivial matters.

354
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,853
Being stubborn with each other

355
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:10,853
may lead to irredeemable consequences.

356
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,953
Come on, let's go.

357
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,253
It's really too bad that I won't be able to hear any more

358
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:22,553
lovey-dovey stories of you and your husband!

359
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,153
Lovey-dovey?

360
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:26,153
No! It's not what you think.

361
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,753
It's not lovey-dovey stories.

362
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,353
Is that true?

363
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:32,953
You idiot! Of course not.

364
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:35,273
Is it true?

365
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,369
Yes, it's true!

366
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:14,853
Does it bother you?

367
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,353
You really won 1 million 200 thousand yen betting on a dark horse?

368
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,553
-What? -Well, congratulations!

369
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,353
We must toast to your win tonight!

370
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,381
What? You're drinking already?

371
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:26,453
I'll be right over! Hold on!

372
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:31,053
That phone call just now?

373
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:33,391
It was from one of my horse racing buddies

374
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,853
that kept calling me from some time ago.

375
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,153
He kept calling persistently

376
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:39,397
because he wanted me to join him drinking in celebration of the win!

377
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,405
Huh? What?

378
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:50,353
Who cares!

379
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:54,353
And? What with the case?

380
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,253
Who cares.

381
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:58,653
Who cares, same here.

382
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,172
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:06,120
"Eisuke Hondo"

384
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,540
The stage for the next episode is at a Karaoke booth.

385
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,740
I may sing off tune, but my deductions are never off.
