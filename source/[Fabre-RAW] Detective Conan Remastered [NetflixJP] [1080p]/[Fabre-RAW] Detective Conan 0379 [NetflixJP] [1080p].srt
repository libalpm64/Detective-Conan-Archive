1
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:24,347
Today's stage is an inn.

2
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,047
Is it a ghost or just the work of some human?

3
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:27,847
The outdoor bath is the key to this question.

4
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:29,447
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,247
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:33,147
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,300
"The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 1)"

8
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,100
My stiff shoulders are killing me these days.

9
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,700
Our hot spring is really good for stiff shoulders.

10
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,200
Excuse me, mister. Is this tonight's desert?

11
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry. This is actually for the other guest.

12
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,500
She loves cake. I heard she is a famous writer or something.

13
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,800
I see.

14
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
You were going to eat it, weren't you?

15
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,300
What? No.

16
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,800
Welcome to Kotoya Hotel. We've been expecting you.

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
You must be cold. Now, please come in.

18
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,100
It's a beautiful kimono.

19
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,200
It's a big garden, too.

20
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,900
Hey! Isn't that Eri Akechi, the love romance writer?

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
-Dad. -That hurts!

22
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Excuse me, sir. Are you the famous detective,

23
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Kogoro Mouri?

24
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,300
Mouri?

25
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,500
You are Mr. Mouri, right?

26
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,300
Yes. That's me.

27
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,800
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,600
I never expected to see a famous person like you in a place like this.

29
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,500
My name is Kyoichi Bando. I'm a producer at Nichiuri TV.

30
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,800
All right.

31
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,500
Well, why don't we sit and talk?

32
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,100
Now tell me, what kind of meeting is this?

33
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,900
Actually, we are planning to make a TV series drama

34
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,500
together with Daigakukan Publishing and us Nichiuri TV.

35
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,800
So I have asked Ms. Eri Akechi over there to write the story.

36
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,700
The story is about three young women trying to make their dream come true.

37
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,600
So we've been interviewing women in different careers.

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
And this time,

39
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I asked Yoriko to get some people from her university.

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,500
Now, here they are.

41
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,100
She's a famous model in Paris and the New York fashion scene.

42
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,900
Asuka Shibasaki.

43
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Hello.

44
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,400
Beautiful!

45
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,500
And, she's an oil painter and the winner of the new face award, Ema Anzai.

46
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Nice to meet you.

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Charming!

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,200
And, this girl is now causing a bit of stir in the music industry.

49
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
The singer songwriter,

50
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Ms. Harumi Fukatsu, right?

51
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm a great fan of yours!

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,100
Thank you.

53
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Somebody's getting pretty famous although she has only one hit song.

54
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,200
It's not going to last long.

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,900
You know, there are many one hit wonders out there.

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,500
Very interesting!

57
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,500
You've all got unique characteristics and are also beautiful!

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
This way, please.

59
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,800
There's a kimono here, too.

60
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
Can I ask you something?

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,900
I saw it everywhere in this hotel.

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,500
How come kimonos are hanging on the wall?

63
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
People worship the Spirit of Kimono as a guardian deity.

64
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
You can see those not only in this hotel,

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but also in ordinary houses and homes.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
It's custom.

67
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
I see. Spirit of Kimono.

68
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,700
I'm so excited about your new stuff, Ms. Akechi.

69
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,500
Oh, no. Call me Eri, please.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,800
Actually, my mom has the same name.

71
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,900
So it feels kind of weird calling you Eri.

72
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,100
The kanji is different though.

73
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,400
Well, but if you call me "Ms. Akechi", it sounds like I'm a detective.

74
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,100
It feels weird.

75
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,900
So I heard people here worship the Spirit of Kimono, am I right?

76
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,700
Yes. This Spirit of Kimono is a guardian deity

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,200
but also have a dark side of face. People call it Kimono Demon.

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,100
Kimono Demon?

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,700
It's an old folklore told in this village.

80
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,300
Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Ohana in this village.

81
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,300
She was a kind, hardworking woman.

82
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,800
One day, Ohana found a samurai, who broke his leg. She helped him.

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,700
As a token of gratitude for her help,

84
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,600
the samurai gave Ohana tons of beautiful kimonos and sashes.

85
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
Being envious of Ohana's fortune,

86
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,700
the village mayor's daughters made a false charge against her.

87
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,200
Ohana was arrested and the daughters took her kimonos.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
That night, Ohana was executed.

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,600
The daughters enjoyed the beauty of the kimonos.

90
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,700
All of a sudden,

91
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,300
the lights went out and...

92
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,400
Hearing the scream, the householders came,

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,900
but what they found were the dead bodies

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,800
of the younger daughter lying on the kimonos

95
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,300
and the body of the older one tangled with many sashes in a pond.

96
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,200
Realizing the graveness of Ohana's grudge,

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,300
the villagers built a small shrine

98
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,400
and worshipped her as a guardian deity of the village.

99
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Ever since then, people in this area

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,500
have worshipped Ohana as the Spirit of Kimono.

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,500
And that is the Great Shrine of the Kimono Spirit.

102
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,600
You must've studied this place a lot.

103
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,000
No, I just stay in this hotel a lot when I write. That's all.

104
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Isn't that Harumi?

105
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,300
You're right. Harumi!

106
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,000
This tree is called Kimono Sakura. It's about 500 years old.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,400
When spring comes, those branches will be covered with flowers.

108
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,100
It looks just like a beautiful kimono.

109
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,800
Harumi, do you know about this place a lot, too?

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
No.

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,800
My friend in university loved this cherry blossom.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,400
She told me about this before.

113
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,100
It crossed my mind, so I came here to see it.

114
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Ran.

115
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,100
What is that small shrine?

116
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Hey, kid! Don't run around.

117
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,300
That's actually the shrine for Kimono Visit.

118
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,200
Kimono Visit?

119
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,400
The Spirit of Kimono is also a deity of vengeance.

120
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,500
Vengeance?

121
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
It's been said that if you wear a kimono

122
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,200
and visit this small shrine at midnight,

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,100
the Spirit of Kimono will take revenge for you.

124
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
And in dedication of the Kimono visit,

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,300
people leave a paper doll in this shrine.

126
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,500
Look! There are new ones!

127
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,800
There are a couple of them.

128
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,900
What?

129
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,900
So somebody came here recently for Kimono visit?

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,800
That means there're two people that this visitor wants to take revenge on.

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,400
Forget about it. It's just a prank.

132
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,700
Don't worry about it, Ran.

133
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,100
Hey. Isn't that a shrine, too?

134
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Come on.

135
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,900
It's just a guest room.

136
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,000
Actually, it's a shrine of the Spirit of Kimono, too.

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,900
Don't tell me there are paper dolls in it, too.

138
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,600
No way, it can't be.

139
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
But something's bugging me.

140
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Please, Dad. Go and check it.

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
Me?

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,900
I don't understand why she's so scared.

143
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,900
There're no paper dolls here.

144
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,800
Right, see?

145
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,400
Right.

146
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,100
Here's nothing!

147
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,600
Good! Thanks!

148
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,000
It's amazing!

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
It just looks like the one on the pamphlet, doesn't it?

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,200
This is paradise.

151
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,800
It's beautiful!

152
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,100
Cheers...

153
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,500
Everyone, thank you so much

154
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000
for your cooperation with our four day interview.

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,900
Eri, make my model character stand out in your drama, will you?

156
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Well, I still don't know what kind of story it's going to be.

157
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,100
So I'm giving you ideas right now!

158
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,900
Mr. Bando,

159
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,000
how about if Harumi sings the opening theme of the drama?

160
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,400
That's a good idea!

162
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Harumi, could you do that?

163
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Only if she's around until then though.

164
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,800
It's good, isn't it?

165
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,900
Oh, my! Is it empty before I even open it?

166
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
How could that be possible?

167
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,600
Ran? Another bottle?

168
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,400
All right! One last bottle, okay?

169
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,800
It'll be the last one, Ran.

170
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,300
No!

171
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
No! Conan, it's not fair!

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
Excuse me?

173
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes, come in.

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,500
Hi, Harumi!

175
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
There's something I would like to discuss with Mr. Mouri.

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,300
Dad.

177
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,600
Yes?

178
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,300
Dad!

179
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
Discuss?

180
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:29,345
It was five years ago. I was in third year in college.

181
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:33,745
There was this illegal drug that a lot of students on campus were using.

182
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:36,645
Somehow, people started to suspect a female student as the drug dealer.

183
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,545
Although she denied the fact that she was the drug dealer,

184
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:42,545
the drugs were found in her locker.

185
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:47,145
She killed herself by jumping off the university building,

186
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,445
saying she was innocent.

187
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:52,545
That person's name is Sakurako Suzuka.

188
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,645
I told you about her under the cherry blossom tree.

189
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:58,045
She was a very kind person, who loved cherry blossoms.

190
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:03,845
There's no way that she was selling the drugs. It just can't be her.

191
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,745
So please, Mr. Mouri!

192
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:09,245
Could you reinvestigate this case again? Please?

193
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:14,045
This was five years ago though.

194
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,745
Actually there was a rumour that the drug dealers

195
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,645
were some other female students.

196
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:19,745
What?

197
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:24,645
But those students were from a family who had a lot of authority.

198
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:28,245
So no one could go against them.

199
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:30,545
Students?

200
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,945
They are Asuka Shibasaki and Ema Anzai.

201
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:37,445
Asuka is a daughter of a parliamentary deputy.

202
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:42,245
And Ema is a daughter of the major construction firm, Anzai Global.

203
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,945
Those two girls didn't get along with Sakurako

204
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:46,745
because of her strong sense of justice.

205
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,845
Mr. Mouri, please look into this!

206
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:54,945
Alright! I'll see what I can do, okay?

207
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:57,945
Thank you so much!

208
00:13:57,945 --> 00:14:01,445
You must like her a lot.

209
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,645
I lost my parents when I was young.

210
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,045
My uncle and aunt raised me.

211
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:11,045
Sakurako also lost her parents by fire,

212
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:13,445
and so she was very kind to me.

213
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,445
You guys are going to the bath now?

214
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,345
You're done already, Ms. Akechi?

215
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:34,745
Yes. I got a little cold.

216
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,745
Then, why don't we have some drink together?

217
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:41,645
I'm sorry. I got some work to do.

218
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,445
Okay, later!

219
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,345
Huh? It's reserved.

220
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,345
You're right.

221
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:54,645
It's locked.

222
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,745
Well, what can we do? It's only 30 more minutes.

223
00:14:57,745 --> 00:15:00,045
Why don't we go upstairs and play some ping pong?

224
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,645
Alright.

225
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:09,245
Somebody's going pretty wild over there.

226
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:11,945
I wonder what Ran and the others are doing?

227
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,845
Here we go!

228
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,845
Yes!

229
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:22,545
You guys already got out?

230
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:25,245
No. Actually, we haven't even got in yet.

231
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,145
It was reserved.

232
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:32,045
Huh? You're wearing glasses.

233
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:34,245
I wear contact lenses usually.

234
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:35,845
I took them off for the outdoor bath just now.

235
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,545
It's past 11.30pm now.

236
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,845
The bath should be open by now.

237
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:52,145
Yes. Let's go.

238
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:57,445
Where are you guys going?

239
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,745
To the female bathroom!

240
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,645
What?

241
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:04,345
Still reserved.

242
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,245
It is locked.

243
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:09,945
What is this?

244
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:12,445
There was nothing when we came here last time.

245
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:18,045
It's weird. This thing is kind of cold.

246
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:22,845
What is this?

247
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,445
What's the matter?

248
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:25,845
Kimono Demon.

249
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:33,245
Pops, break down the door!

250
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,845
Okay! Let me do it!

251
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,645
Dad!

252
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,945
This just got me really sober.

253
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:53,045
Conan, is anybody there?

254
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,845
Yes, but in fact...

255
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:03,945
Asuka!

256
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:08,045
Asuka!

257
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:10,245
Asuka, are you alright?

258
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:14,645
She's stabbed in the chest.

259
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,945
The folklore of the Kimono Demon.

260
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,045
Oh, no.

261
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,545
Hey, Conan! Where are you going?

262
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:24,345
In the folklore, two sisters are killed.

263
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:31,345
Hey, what's going on?

264
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,645
Asuka is...

265
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:35,545
What's the matter?

266
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:36,945
In the outdoor bath, Asuka was found dead.

267
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:39,645
Actually, it was a murder.

268
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,145
What is it?

269
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,745
Oh, my God.

270
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:43,745
Where is Ema?

271
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:47,345
I think she went over there about an hour ago.

272
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,045
Are those the footprints of Ema's boots?

273
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:03,345
Is she in there?

274
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,445
Please don't step on the footprints.

275
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:08,745
I know that! Did you forget that I'm a detective?

276
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:27,545
So it is the Kimono Demon.

277
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:30,745
She's stabbed in her chest, too.

278
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:34,745
Outside, only Ema's footprints and nothing else was found.

279
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:38,445
In other words, this is a locked room closed off by the snow.

280
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,445
Excuse me, sir!

281
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:44,745
I suppose you're Detective Mouri.

282
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,045
Yes, I am.

283
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:50,745
I am Ogura, the police officer of this village!

284
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:51,745
Did you contact the prefectural police department?

285
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:54,245
Yes, I did.

286
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,045
But the road condition is not good because of the snow.

287
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,245
So I suppose they won't be here until tomorrow morning.

288
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,045
Tomorrow morning.

289
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,445
No choice then.

290
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,945
I guess we have to do the on-site investigation on our own.

291
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:09,845
Miss? Could you bring me some bath towels, please?

292
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,645
Sure!

293
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,745
Please wait in the hall.

294
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:17,145
Yes...

295
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,545
Do it slowly, Mr. Ogura.

296
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:26,645
Yes, slowly. Cover those footprints.

297
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:30,945
This pass under the eaves leads to the back door.

298
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:36,645
Yet, there are no footprints whatsoever.

299
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,345
Wait a minute.

300
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,545
Something's wrong.

301
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,245
What is it? Something's wrong.

302
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:48,045
Hey, don't move it!

303
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:50,245
I don't want the footprints to be covered with snow!

304
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:55,145
There you are.

305
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:58,345
Sorry, we decided to sit rather than stand. It's was Eri's idea.

306
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:00,445
Did you find anything?

307
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:07,245
Yoriko, you said Ema passed this lobby around 10.30pm.

308
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,145
Yes, I did.

309
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:11,345
Did you see anybody else?

310
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,945
No, I didn't.

311
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,945
It's getting more complicated.

312
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,845
What do you mean by that?

313
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,745
First of all, around the shrine where Ema was murdered,

314
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:29,245
there were no footprints found other than hers.

315
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,445
So, did Ema killed herself?

316
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:32,945
I don't think so.

317
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:36,045
There were no weapons found in there.

318
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:37,645
No way.

319
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:41,345
Secondly, in order to go to the outdoor bath where Asuka was murdered,

320
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:45,645
you have to go through the recreation hall.

321
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:52,045
We were there after 10.30pm, but didn't see anybody passing through.

322
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,845
What about climbing the cliff and going to the outdoor bath?

323
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:56,045
I already checked it.

324
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:59,045
There were no suspicious traces found on the cliff.

325
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:03,745
Then, Asuka was murdered before 10.30pm?

326
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:08,145
We found a dagger and a stun gun in the bathtub.

327
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:12,145
The murderer most likely attacked Asuka with the stun gun first,

328
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,345
then killed her in the outdoor bath.

329
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:17,945
The dagger in fact had a nacre decoration in its hilt.

330
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,145
I asked the staffs about it.

331
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,645
She said it was the votive dagger dedicated to the shrine in the garden.

332
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,245
The votive dagger?

333
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,645
And one more thing.

334
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:30,245
Ema's bandana was also found in the outdoor bath.

335
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,845
There was blood on that bandana.

336
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:34,445
What does that mean?

337
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:36,845
That means...

338
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:41,545
Assuming that both victims were murdered with the same dagger,

339
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:46,045
it's plausible to think that Ema was killed before Asuka was.

340
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,745
Furthermore, Ema was alive until 10.30pm.

341
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:53,345
So theoretically, Asuka was killed after 10.30pm.

342
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,545
How did the murderer get into the outdoor bath, though?

343
00:21:56,545 --> 00:22:00,545
There were no traces in the shrine of the garden, right?

344
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:04,545
Give me a break. You got to be a ghost or something to do that.

345
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:05,545
It's the curse.

346
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:08,845
It's the curse of the Kimono Demon.

347
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:11,145
What do you mean?

348
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:13,045
We saw it!

349
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:18,445
I saw a couple of new paper dolls dedicated to the shrine!

350
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:22,445
The Kimono Demon's curse killed Asuka and Ema.

351
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,945
No, it can't be.

352
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:28,145
A curse did not kill the girls. It's obvious.

353
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:33,445
But what was the trick that the murderer used?

354
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:34,572
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:36,372
"Sash"

356
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:38,172
Hey, Ran! Do you have a sash?

357
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,372
A black one for karate though.

358
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:41,076
That's what I thought.
