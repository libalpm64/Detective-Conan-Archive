1
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,395
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,195
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,795
The relationship between master and apprentice has been broken.

4
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:10,795
But the story of saury will reconcile them.

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,195
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,795
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:15,595
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:59,378
Sand and fish under the water.

9
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:01,478
The end of clouds and waters.

10
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:03,178
What we eat and where we sleep.

11
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:06,678
Where we sleep...

12
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:11,078
What we eat and where we sleep...

13
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:12,578
And where you live!

14
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:15,778
5-39 Beika Town!

15
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:18,778
I'm not talking about your home.

16
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,078
It's the next line.

17
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,678
You forgot it already?

18
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:23,178
It's been almost for a week.

19
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:25,078
I can't believe he still haven't memorize the lines.

20
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,378
Yabura-koji and Bura-koji.

21
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:31,678
Paipo, paipo.

22
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,578
Paipo, paipo!

23
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:37,878
Paipo, Paipo's hooligan.

24
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,778
Hooligan's Shaolin boxing.

25
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,578
It's Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

26
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,878
Shuringan's Gurindai.

27
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:49,878
Gurindai's Popokopi and Ponpokona.

28
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,578
Now, the name is Chokyumei Chosuke.

29
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:54,978
Mouri,

30
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:57,578
maybe you want to forget about it this time.

31
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,778
I don't think you are the kind of person to do memorization.

32
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,178
Don't say that, Inspector.

33
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,878
Well, I think I know why you're doing this.

34
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,178
It's about all-you-can-drink, isn't it?

35
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,678
I understand, but it's not worth embarrassing yourself.

36
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:14,678
Well, it's not that.

37
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:17,278
Mr. Mouri, are you going to the hall already?

38
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:18,978
You're all pumped up, aren't you?

39
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,278
"Nagaro Uwajima (50)" -The famous Detective Mouri

40
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:24,078
is going to do rakugo storytelling. People are talking about it, you know.

41
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,078
He's Nagaro Uwajima, my facilitator.

42
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:29,478
Did you hear that, Inspector?

43
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:31,978
Would you still say that I should quit rakugo storytelling?

44
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,878
All right, all right.

45
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:35,878
I'll teach you a story, but it's a short one,

46
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,178
so you can memorize it easily.

47
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:39,778
Dear! Please look ahead while you're driving.

48
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,478
There's no deer on the road.

49
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:46,578
Oh dear, you're talking about that deer.

50
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,378
Now, that's the right one for him.

51
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:57,578
"Meguro Saury"

52
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:03,778
Hey, it's Master Manrakutei Ichimatsu.

53
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,978
Master Ichimatsu, are you ready for today?

54
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:09,978
"Manrakutei Ichimatsu (55)" -Yes, Nagaro.

55
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,578
No worries.

56
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,178
He is my childhood friend.

57
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,878
Who was that boy earlier?

58
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:19,478
Well, he wanted to be my apprentice,

59
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,778
but I told him to come after graduating from school.

60
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,478
Master, tea is ready.

61
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,978
Hi, Uwajima.

62
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,078
Nagaro, why don't you have tea with us?

63
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,078
And you too, please.

64
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:34,178
Well, what is the master of rakugo storytelling doing here?

65
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:36,078
He's a helper for this restaurant.

66
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,778
A helper?

67
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,478
Who is that lady then?

68
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:41,878
Spring has finally come to master.

69
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:44,478
And now he is out from his bachelor life.

70
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:52,178
"Miya Meguro (30)" -What kind of fish is that?

71
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,578
It's saury.

72
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:56,178
That's a lot of saury.

73
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:57,978
I get it.

74
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:02,478
Master, your storytelling for today is "Meguro Saury", isn't it?

75
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,878
Yes.

76
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:06,978
Your "Meguro Saury" is amazing.

77
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:11,978
People are going to come here to eat saury after your performance.

78
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,078
That's what it's for, isn't it?

79
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:16,778
Hey, what is "Meguro Saury"?

80
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:19,378
"Meguro Saury" is a rakugo story.

81
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,078
Long ago, there was a king who was brought up protected from the world.

82
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,678
One day, he went out to Meguro to hunt birds.

83
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,978
There, a farmer served him a meal which was a saury,

84
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:30,278
which he had never eaten before in his life.

85
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,678
Being so impressed with its taste,

86
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,278
the king ordered a saury again when he went to a different place.

87
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,978
However, the saury that was served

88
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,078
was mealy and flaky because his servant steamed and broke it into flakes

89
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:44,078
to make it safe and healthy to eat.

90
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,178
Since the saury tasted so different,

91
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,878
the king asked what kind of saury it was.

92
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:52,478
"It was saury that just landed in Boshu", said the servant.

93
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,178
And then, the king said...

94
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,878
-"Meguro Saury is the best!" -"Meguro Saury is the best!"

95
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,278
What happened?

96
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,278
It hurts...

97
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,678
I think I cut my finger with the broken cup.

98
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,478
You're bleeding!

99
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:10,478
Hey, I'm alright.

100
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,978
People are watching us.

101
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,778
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,078
You're going to be on stage tonight.

103
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:17,978
You have to take care of yourself.

104
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:33,078
Thank you for the tea, Miya.

105
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:37,678
Master, the party after the show is at Meruhen at 7 o'clock, okay?

106
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,178
All right. Meruhen at 7 o'clock, I got it.

107
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,878
Okay, we're going to head to the hall now.

108
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:48,678
She is the wife of Master Ichimatsu's apprentice?

109
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:51,878
Yes. His name is Manrakutei Kisaburo.

110
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,178
He is a famous rakugo storyteller, right?

111
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:56,478
She's his wife?

112
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,578
She's actually divorced with that man

113
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:02,378
and Master Ichimatsu is looking after her now.

114
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:03,978
This is just my guess,

115
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:08,178
but it looks like Master Ichimatsu has been helping her out financially.

116
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,078
What a gentleman he is.

117
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:15,178
Well, I'm more worried about him because she might just be using him.

118
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:16,878
What do you mean by that?

119
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:20,978
How could a wife be intimate with someone who ousted her husband?

120
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:24,378
People are saying that Master Ichimatsu has made a lot of money.

121
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:27,878
So I thought that she's getting close to him just for that.

122
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,578
Looks can be deceiving, is that what you mean?

123
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:35,278
I guess people are humane only in rakugo stories.

124
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:39,778
"Talent Show"

125
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:47,978
Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

126
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,878
Shuringan's Shuringan's...

127
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:53,478
The short one!

128
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,178
Change it to the short story.

129
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:56,878
Oh, okay.

130
00:07:56,878 --> 00:08:00,778
There's no deer on the road.

131
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,278
Gosh!

132
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,478
How could he say the ending first?

133
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,078
Look ahead! Look ahead!

134
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:09,278
Look ahead?

135
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:10,778
Oh, I see!

136
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:14,978
Dear, please look ahead while you're driving.

137
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,578
There's no deer on the road.

138
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,278
Master Ichimatsu, please.

139
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,278
Okay.

140
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,078
So, how did it go, Mr. Mouri?

141
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,478
I didn't know I was that talented.

142
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,078
You should've seen the way people were laughing.

143
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:39,278
They were laughing at you, not your story.

144
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:40,278
Is that right?

145
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,378
Maybe you should teach me how to do rakugo storytelling?

146
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:55,578
Is this a saury?

147
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,878
Tell me where you bought it.

148
00:08:57,878 --> 00:09:00,278
It is from the riverside of Nihonbashi.

149
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,878
I chose the freshest one, my Lord.

150
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,378
You dunderhead. Meguro saury is the best.

151
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:22,178
Master, we're going to drink all night!

152
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,178
Next time, I'll get the first prize!

153
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,678
Hey, hey. He's going to do it again?

154
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:30,078
Excuse me, my friend may be visiting me.

155
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,378
So why don't you go ahead?

156
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:35,078
There's some work left for me too,

157
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:37,278
so could you wait for me outside just a little while, please?

158
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,778
Uwajima is a busy man.

159
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:01,878
Looks like he's done.

160
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:04,478
Master, we'll head out to the party place now.

161
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,978
Sorry to keep you waiting long.

162
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,778
Where's Master Ichimatsu?

163
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,178
His friend hasn't come yet, so he said he'll catch up later.

164
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,378
I see.

165
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,478
This is Megure.

166
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:22,178
What? Master Ichimatsu has been stabbed?

167
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:28,678
It was an anonymous call?

168
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:29,878
It was a man's voice,

169
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,878
saying that Master Ichimatsu had been stabbed in this dressing room.

170
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:35,078
It's a lot of blood.

171
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,878
He was lying unconscious when he was found.

172
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,778
Is he going to make it?

173
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,078
I don't know.

174
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,878
What is this?

175
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,978
Megurono?

176
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,478
Isn't that about the rakugo storytelling, "Meguro Saury"?

177
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:56,278
He wanted to write "Meguro Saury", but he couldn't finish it.

178
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,878
Speaking of Meguro, I need you to see this.

179
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:00,178
Look at the handle of this knife.

180
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:03,178
It's kind of scraped off, but it says "Meguro".

181
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:04,578
Meguro...

182
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:06,378
Meguro Saury...

183
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:07,678
Saury Lunch...

184
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,878
Inspector Megure, I got it!

185
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,778
The culprit is...

186
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,678
Miya.

187
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,678
She's the lady at Meguro Restaurant.

188
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,278
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,478
It was me.

190
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,478
It was me who did it.

191
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,978
This is your knife, right?

192
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,378
Yes.

193
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:29,278
But why did you do it?

194
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,578
Let me explain instead.

195
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:33,078
You had some financial trouble.

196
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,878
You owed Master Ichimatsu money,

197
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:39,678
but if you kill him, you don't have to pay it back.

198
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:41,878
Wasn't that what you thought?

199
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:43,578
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,778
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

201
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:46,878
To the station, please.

202
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,178
Wait a minute!

203
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:49,878
She didn't do anything!

204
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:51,578
Excuse me, who are you?

205
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:56,678
You are...

206
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:59,078
Manrakutei Kisaburo.

207
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:00,878
Master Ichimatsu's apprentice.

208
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:03,178
"Manrakutei Kisaburo (30)" -It was me who did it.

209
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:07,178
I'm Manrakutei Kisaburo, the one that was ousted a year ago.

210
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:11,378
I stole the knife from Miya's restaurant

211
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,778
and I stabbed Master Ichimatsu.

212
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,378
Why did you do that?

213
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:18,778
He may not be your master now, but at least he was before, right?

214
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:20,078
Inspector!

215
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,878
He is lying just to protect me.

216
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,778
It was me who did it.

217
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,078
I became pretty popular and got bigheaded.

218
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:29,278
So I skipped a show, had some debts gambling.

219
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,778
I also had some love affairs.

220
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:36,778
But I don't think he should have kicked me out!

221
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:38,278
So that's your motive?

222
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:39,678
That's a lie.

223
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:42,578
He loves rakugo storytelling more than anything.

224
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,878
He must be longing to come back on stage again.

225
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,878
Such a person wouldn't do that kind of thing.

226
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:51,378
Then how do you explain these words that master wrote?

227
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,278
"Meguro Saury."

228
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,578
It's my favourite story.

229
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:56,978
Then it's been cleared.

230
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:58,678
Mr. Mouri, no!

231
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,078
He didn't do anything!

232
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,978
It was me! I did it!

233
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,978
You shut up, got that?

234
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:05,678
These two think that the other is the culprit

235
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,078
and they're protecting each other.

236
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,578
Anyway, what's the meaning of this message?

237
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,278
Come to think of it, Master Ichimatsu said...

238
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,578
Excuse me, my friend may be visiting me.

239
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,778
So why don't you go ahead?

240
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:26,478
Who was the master waiting for, anyway?

241
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:40,278
Party at 7 o'clock.

242
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,578
Meruhen?

243
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:43,578
Wait a minute!

244
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:48,778
I got it!

245
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:52,278
That must be it!

246
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:02,023
Okay, we will find out the detailed facts in the station.

247
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:03,323
-Let's go, Chiba. -Yes, sir.

248
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,523
What are you doing there?

249
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:10,523
Let's go!

250
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,923
Inspector, please wait.

251
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,223
Those two have nothing to do with this crime at all.

252
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:27,023
Kisaburo, you visited Master Ichimatsu's dressing room.

253
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:31,223
Around the time when we were heading down to Restaurant Meruhen.

254
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:33,623
Probably a little before 7 o'clock.

255
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,623
He was already down on the floor.

256
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:43,323
And there, you found a knife that had a familiar name on it.

257
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:47,423
So you thought Miya did it. Am I right?

258
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:49,123
That's why you...

259
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:54,623
On the other hand, Miya saw Kisaburo going into this room.

260
00:14:57,423 --> 00:15:02,323
As soon as he found Master Ichimatsu lying on the floor, he left the room.

261
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:10,223
When she saw this, she thought Kisaburo murdered Master Ichimatsu.

262
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,423
You saw me there? Now, I understand.

263
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:15,323
Well, what else could I think?

264
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:18,523
And also, I am your biggest fan.

265
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:21,423
If the police come, I thought I should...

266
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,023
I see.

267
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,823
But you really thought I killed Master?

268
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,523
How could you even think that?

269
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,623
Well, how could you think that I killed him, too?

270
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,923
I would never hurt him, ever!

271
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,923
Guys, please!

272
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:38,423
Mouri, who stabbed Master Ichimatsu?

273
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:44,023
Master Ichimatsu actually wrote the name of the murderer on this board.

274
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,523
You mean this "Megurono"?

275
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:48,723
This can't be a person's name.

276
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:53,723
Officer Chiba, do you see Master Ichimatsu's bag under the whiteboard?

277
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:56,523
Would you please take the notebook out of it?

278
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,923
Now, I would like you to read Master Ichimatsu's schedule for tonight.

279
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:04,223
Party at 7 o'clock.

280
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:05,223
Naruheso?

281
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:07,823
Naruheso?

282
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:10,823
What is Naruheso?

283
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,323
Yeah, it does say "Naruheso".

284
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,623
Now, please remember.

285
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:19,623
Master Ichimatsu cut his right finger. We saw it.

286
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:24,123
He probably used his left hand to write "Meruhen",

287
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:25,823
but it got deformed.

288
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:30,923
So "Meruhen" turned into "Naruheso".

289
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:35,523
Inspector, tilt your head to the side

290
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,323
and look at the word on the whiteboard.

291
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:42,323
If you tilt this letter "me", it becomes "na".

292
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:44,623
Likewise, "gu" becomes "ga".

293
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:48,623
"Ro" stays the same, but "no" could be a long vowel.

294
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,423
Now, guess what we got?

295
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:56,323
Nagaro?

296
00:16:57,823 --> 00:17:00,623
Uwajima, where do you think you're going?

297
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,723
I got some stuff to do so.

298
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,723
Well, you need to hang out with us a little longer.

299
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:10,723
Uwajima, I think Master Ichimatsu wanted to write your name.

300
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:15,623
Yes, he wanted to tell us that you were the culprit.

301
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,023
Are you kidding?

302
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:18,423
When did I do it?

303
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,823
I didn't have enough time to do it, Mr. Mouri.

304
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,923
You know that, right?

305
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:25,823
Officer Chiba, please search at the hole on the ceiling.

306
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:28,423
All right.

307
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,223
There's a bag under the roof.

308
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,823
I asked Conan to search for it a while ago.

309
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:44,923
It showed that this room and the office are connected under the roof.

310
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:47,323
Now, please check what's inside.

311
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:48,323
Yes, sir.

312
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:56,023
You're selling this at your store.

313
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:58,023
Women usually put this doll in their room

314
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:00,423
so it looked like a man is with them.

315
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:02,423
For the sake of their own safety.

316
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:04,123
You actually put this by the window,

317
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,523
so it looked like you were doing some work.

318
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:08,423
What you were actually doing during this time,

319
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:10,923
you come into this dressing room through the space under the roof,

320
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,423
pick up a knife that you put there beforehand and killed Master.

321
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:15,423
Uwajima...

322
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:19,723
You joined us like nothing happened,

323
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,023
and headed out to Meruhen together.

324
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:23,223
No. That's nonsense.

325
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:24,523
It's not me.

326
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:25,523
Where is the evidence?

327
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:28,223
Do you have anything that proves that I stabbed him?

328
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,323
Officer Chiba, do you see the speaker on the wall?

329
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:33,523
Speaker?

330
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:37,123
-Yes. -Will you search around the speaker?

331
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,923
There should be a MD recorder.

332
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:41,623
A MD recorder?

333
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,023
Please take a look.

334
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:46,623
The power is on in order to record what is going on in the hall.

335
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:50,223
Master Ichimatsu asked me something just a while ago.

336
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:52,923
So, how did it go, Mr. Mouri?

337
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:57,223
That means he wasn't listening to my storytelling.

338
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,323
The MD recorder wasn't on.

339
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:00,623
But now it is...

340
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:01,923
On.

341
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,623
Who turned it on?

342
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:04,923
Probably by somebody

343
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:10,423
who wanted to wiretap Master Ichimatsu's "Meguro Saury".

344
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:13,323
It was on the speaker.

345
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:17,323
Officer Chiba, could you please rewind and play it?

346
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:24,223
You dunderhead. Meguro saury is the best.

347
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:31,323
Uwajima, recorders today are not like the ones before.

348
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:34,323
It can record much, much longer.

349
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:38,223
Officer Chiba, the moment of the incident should be recorded in the tape.

350
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:41,123
Please fast-forward it to that part.

351
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:42,123
Yes, sir.

352
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,723
Nagaro, what are you doing? Nagaro!

353
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:50,623
Shut up! Getting conceited after being called master!

354
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,923
It's all because of you that Miya doesn't listen to me!

355
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,623
Stop talking nonsense!

356
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:58,523
Miya is waiting for Kisaburo to come back.

357
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,723
Darn it!

358
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:03,423
Please stop it!

359
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,823
Stop. It was me.

360
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:08,923
I stole the knife from Miya's restaurant

361
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,123
and I stabbed him.

362
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:24,623
Hey, kid.

363
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,323
This is master's recording tape. You can have this.

364
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:31,423
This has "Meguro Saury", so forget about your MD.

365
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:34,323
I understand that you like master's storytelling,

366
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,323
but you can never record it like that, okay?

367
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:38,023
Okay! I'm sorry!

368
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,023
Miya! Kisaburo!

369
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,723
I just got a call from the hospital.

370
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,223
They said Master is going to be fine.

371
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:51,023
But, how could you think that I stabbed Master

372
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:53,523
just because you saw me coming out of his room?

373
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:57,123
-Yeah, because you were holding a knife in your hand. -A knife?

374
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,623
Conan, the knife she saw might be that.

375
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,823
Yes. I think so, too.

376
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,223
You brought this, right, Kisaburo?

377
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:11,723
So it was there?

378
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,423
It was the freshest saury I found this morning.

379
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:17,023
I got it for Master.

380
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:19,523
You thought this was a knife, didn't you?

381
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:24,023
It was kind of dark and you had a languishing look on your face.

382
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:28,623
You are so stupid!

383
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,923
How could a saury look like a knife?

384
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,423
Come on, guys.

385
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:35,823
In Japanese, you write "autumn", "sword" and "fish",

386
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:37,123
and you read it as "saury".

387
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,223
It's understandable that you made the mistake.

388
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:42,923
Now, no need to worry about Master Ichimatsu.

389
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:46,623
Why don't you eat that saury together, like you used to do before?

390
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,923
Well, I wouldn't mind that.

391
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,623
Me neither.

392
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:53,623
But we have to go and see Master first.

393
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:58,223
Why don't you ask him to let you work as his apprentice again?

394
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:00,123
You think he'll forgive me?

395
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:02,323
He will,

396
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:05,823
because he's been waiting for you to come back.

397
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,723
I was daydreaming again.

398
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:45,923
Conan, you're crying because of my story, aren't you?

399
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,823
Storytelling usually gets kids bored and sleepy, but mine doesn't.

400
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:53,223
I think that tells how good I am.

401
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,923
I'm not sleeping

402
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:58,023
because you're sitting where I'm supposed to be sleeping.

403
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,180
"Evil Message"

405
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,760
What? Next week the two detectives are going to do an hour show?
