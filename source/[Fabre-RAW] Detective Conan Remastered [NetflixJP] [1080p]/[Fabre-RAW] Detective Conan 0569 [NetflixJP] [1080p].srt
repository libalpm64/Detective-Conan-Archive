1
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:07,129
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Shiratori at the movie theater

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,329
and heard of his memory

3
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:10,229
of a fateful encounter with a girl during his childhood,

4
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:12,729
who he thought was Officer Sato,

5
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:16,229
that triggered his desire to become a police officer.

6
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:18,729
The woman that

7
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,229
"Nami Kasakura (27)" -he gets to know at the theater

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,829
named Ms. Nami Kasakura,

9
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,829
like the girl in his memory,

10
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,329
decorated the cup of coke with a strip of paper flower

11
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,129
that she made out of the wrapper of a straw.

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,729
Could it be that Nami is the girl in his memory?

13
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,829
Hearing that Nami was troubled by a stalker,

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,829
we went to visit her condo along with Inspector Shiratori,

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,429
and found her boyfriend Mr. Yoshiro Somei,

16
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:48,029
killed by someone and lying dead.

17
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:50,229
Did the stalker commit the crime?

18
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,529
Or did Nami commit the crime

19
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,929
making it look like the work of a stalker?

20
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,829
But, her alibi was proven by none other than

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,929
Inspector Shiratori and ourselves.

22
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,229
If she is the one who did it,

23
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,729
what kind of trick did she use to commit the crime?

24
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,529
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

25
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,329
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

26
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,329
Encounter and goodbye,

27
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:15,529
the season of cherry blossoms.

28
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:17,729
Inspector Shiratori is about to fall in love.

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,429
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,429
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,329
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:08,435
"Inspector Shiratori Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 2)".

33
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:15,735
We verified Ms. Kasakura's alibi,

34
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,335
and although we looked inside the room,

35
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,935
no wiretap or camera was found.

36
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:24,635
No traces of a stalker having been in the room were found, but...

37
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:29,735
Takagi is speaking.

38
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,035
Did you find anything?

39
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,435
Well, the thing is,

40
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:35,335
there seems to have been quite a lot of people who left the theater

41
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:37,035
during the movie to go to the restroom.

42
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:40,835
Nobody seems to remember who went in and out.

43
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:43,035
Today is Sunday and it's really crowded,

44
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,635
so I think that's to be expected.

45
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,935
I see.

46
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:49,435
-Takagi. -Hey.

47
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,535
There's a trash can on that floor, isn't there?

48
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:55,735
Yes, although they're about to dispose of what's inside right now.

49
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,335
Then, go tell them that you're a police officer

50
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,635
and retrieve it, won't you?

51
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,735
There should be a cup that is wrapped with

52
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,835
a strip of paper shaped in flowers made of the wrapper of a straw

53
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,035
inside the trash.

54
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:09,635
A strip of paper flowers made out of the wrapper of a straw?

55
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,535
I found it!

56
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:15,735
Will you take that to forensics?

57
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,035
Just to be safe,

58
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:19,735
take the other cups inside the bag together with it too.

59
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:22,535
Check the fingerprints on the cup

60
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,335
and substance inside the drink of the cup.

61
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,635
-Yes, sir. -And...

62
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,135
And?

63
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:35,335
And...

64
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:43,935
No, that'll be all.

65
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:49,435
Let me know as soon as you get the results.

66
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:54,735
I'm sorry that I asked him to do things for me without asking you first.

67
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:56,935
No problem.

68
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:32,735
Hey.

69
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,935
Why didn't you ask about the wrapper of the straw?

70
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:41,835
It could've served as conclusive evidence, and yet...

71
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,035
Just what're you talking about?

72
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:48,335
Don't tell me it's because she's beautiful

73
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:51,235
and you finally got to know her.

74
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:54,035
I sure hope you're not going to say something dopey like that.

75
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:57,735
Personal emotions are to be left out when investigating,

76
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:01,235
right, Inspector Shiratori?

77
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,535
Indeed.

78
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,235
Exactly.

79
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,335
Buy a drink at this store?

80
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:22,835
I'm not thirsty, though.

81
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,935
Never mind, just buy one

82
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:27,335
and do as I say from now.

83
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:28,535
Hey.

84
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:31,435
I've figured out

85
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:35,435
the reason why Inspector Shiratori hesitated.

86
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,635
I measured it as you told me to.

87
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:47,435
And? How long is it?

88
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,535
Isn't it a bit short?

89
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,835
No, it was exactly the same.

90
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,735
I see.

91
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:00,735
So, it was the same,

92
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:03,535
It seems he got the answer he was looking for.

93
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:05,435
Yeah.

94
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:09,935
The answer to a sad result.

95
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:12,435
But the cherry blossom mark

96
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,935
is what all police officers have on them!

97
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,535
It's strong, kind and awesome,

98
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:19,735
a flower of justice!

99
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,435
Taking into consideration Ms. Kasakura's testimony...

100
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:33,435
While she was watching a movie at the theater today,

101
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,335
the stalker came into this room,

102
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:39,035
and killed Mr. Yoshiro Somei

103
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:42,035
who was waiting in her room for her to come home.

104
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:46,435
I guess there's no doubt that he fled the scene after that.

105
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:48,235
I can't really come to any conclusion

106
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:51,135
unless we question the people in this vicinity.

107
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:53,235
What about the children?

108
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,935
I've asked the elementary school teacher

109
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,935
to come pick them up.

110
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:02,135
Since both Dr. Agasa and Mr. Mouri weren't home.

111
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:06,335
Do you still have something you want to confirm with the children about?

112
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:08,035
No.

113
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,135
Inspector Shiratori.

114
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:14,135
Well, then, Ms. Kasakura,

115
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,035
please come to the station with me,

116
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,035
so that I can ask you some questions on the case.

117
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:22,935
But could I be given permission to spend some time alone?

118
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,835
I'm quite shocked over his death, you see.

119
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,635
I guess so.

120
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,435
Then, after you've gotten yourself together again,

121
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,235
-I'll send one of my men over to pick you up... -No.

122
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:35,535
Please have her come to the station right away.

123
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,535
Not as a material witness,

124
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:41,335
but as a suspect of this homicide case.

125
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:56,045
The one who murdered Mr. Yoshiro Somei in this room...

126
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:59,345
is you, isn't it, Ms. Nami Kasakura?

127
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,745
Hey, hey. Just what're you talking about?

128
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:10,345
From the estimated time of death of the victim,

129
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:13,645
the crime was around 14:00 today.

130
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:17,945
At that time, Ms. Kasakura was seated in the theatre next to you

131
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:20,845
watching the movie, isn't that what you said?

132
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:23,645
Moreover, the victim had called Ms. Kasahara on her cell phone

133
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,745
just before he was murdered.

134
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,745
And the children who were sitting behind you

135
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:32,645
saw that she received the call, you know?

136
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,445
Yeah! We saw it. It was pitch dark,

137
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:38,345
but there was a flash of light in the seat in front and it got bright.

138
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,545
I saw that lady who was wearing a hat.

139
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:45,345
That flash of light meant that she received a call.

140
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:48,745
Right? Conan, you saw it with Ai too, didn't you?

141
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:49,845
Yeah.

142
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,345
I did see it.

143
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:55,345
The knitted hat that she was wearing.

144
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:01,145
Right. It's not that we saw her in person.

145
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,245
What we saw

146
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,245
was the person who was made to wear the hat

147
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,645
and was shined on by the light of the cell phone.

148
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:09,845
The person who emerged in the dark.

149
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,645
In other words, what we saw was the silhouette of Inspector Shiratori

150
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,145
who was sitting in the seat next to her.

151
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:18,645
That's right, isn't it, Inspector Shiratori?

152
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:19,745
Yeah.

153
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,045
But, even if the cell phone emitted light,

154
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:26,345
if it's not near the face, isn't it hard to see it?

155
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:29,245
It was on top the cup of coke.

156
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:33,245
If the cell phone is placed opened on the cup, then...

157
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:36,545
it would be the same distance as

158
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,345
when you pick it up by hand, when it shines.

159
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:43,045
Of course, the vibe and ringtone were both switched off.

160
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:45,645
But if so, wouldn't the people in the surrounding seats

161
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,845
think that something funny is happening?

162
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,245
If there were people right near our seats,

163
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,745
then maybe they would have doubts,

164
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:55,245
but the aisle was behind our seats

165
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,245
and the seats to both of our sides were empty.

166
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,345
It is highly possible

167
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:04,345
Ms. Kasahara also bought the tickets for both the seats on the internet.

168
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,245
Sitting just one seat away,

169
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:10,245
it is virtually impossible to see what anyone is doing in the dark.

170
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:16,145
Which means that you just happened to buy

171
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,545
the seat beside her that she didn't buy?

172
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,745
Yes.

173
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,945
Even if I didn't buy it,

174
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:22,945
since it's the seat of a movie that is popular

175
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,045
and more so, it being Sunday,

176
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,445
the seat would've eventually been taken by someone right away.

177
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:30,645
If the ticket is bought on the internet,

178
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:31,845
it's possible to see on screen

179
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,445
the number of seats that are already taken.

180
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,245
Ms. Kasakura who saw that the five seats

181
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,545
behind the seats that she had purchased were taken,

182
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,645
in order to verify that the seats belonged to the children,

183
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,545
were watching them from near the ticket vending machine

184
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,445
before the movie started.

185
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,045
Then, she deliberately pretended to forget her wallet

186
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,545
in front of the children.

187
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:47,845
After making sure that the children sees her wallet,

188
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,745
she befriends them.

189
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:52,345
Then after watching the movie,

190
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,845
she takes the children with her to her condo,

191
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,145
and pretends to find the dead body together with the children.

192
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:59,345
She probably wanted the children to prove her alibi.

193
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:03,145
No way.

194
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:07,245
I'm pretty sure that after finding out I was a police detective,

195
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:11,645
she decided that taking me along with everyone would clear things faster.

196
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,245
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

197
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:19,945
But, unless you happened to fall asleep like you did,

198
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:21,645
she couldn't have committed the crime.

199
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,545
I just did not happen to.

200
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:28,245
It's most likely that in the cup of coke I drank from,

201
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:31,445
she poured in some sleeping drug or something.

202
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,145
Sleeping drug?

203
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:35,745
The thing is, before I went to my seat...

204
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:37,345
Seeing me searching for my seat

205
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:39,745
while looking at the half portion of my ticket,

206
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:42,745
after confirming that I was going to be the one sitting next to her

207
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,745
that she was going to place the hat on,

208
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,545
she deliberately bumped into me,

209
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,645
and spilled my coke.

210
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,045
She put the sleeping drug inside the cup that she brought back to me

211
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:53,345
in exchange for the coke she had spilled, and gave it to me.

212
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,245
Of course,

213
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,645
you can never tell if the sleeping drug would be effective

214
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,945
in a short amount of time

215
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,945
because that differs from person to person.

216
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,645
But if she were trying it over and over,

217
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:03,945
she would eventually run into someone like me

218
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,945
who would fall asleep completely.

219
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:10,645
Well, I guess we can figure that out by looking at

220
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,345
the history of the tickets she purchased.

221
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,945
We would probably find that she bought tickets

222
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:16,645
for the three seats in question

223
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,045
at the movie time on Saturday that is most crowded.

224
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:21,545
If not,

225
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,645
there is no way she would know in such detail

226
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:27,745
about the contents of the movie that she didn't get to see today.

227
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,945
Today is the first time I saw the movie!

228
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:32,245
The seat I bought for before was for a friend!

229
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,645
I invited the friend to come many times

230
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:36,045
but was turned down because something else came up.

231
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,145
Right! Please check if there is any sleeping drug

232
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,745
inside your coke cup.

233
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:44,545
It should be easy because your cup has something on it.

234
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:49,245
Are you referring to this flower?

235
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,645
The strip of flower you made

236
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:54,945
out of the paper straw wrapper that you stuck on my cup.

237
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:58,345
In fact, I tore one off

238
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:02,145
and have it stuck between the page of my notebook to remember you by.

239
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,945
So, if we check my cup that I threw away

240
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,345
into the trash box of the theater...

241
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,245
Here it is.

242
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:13,145
Then, please tell us about

243
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,445
the length of the strip of flower once again.

244
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:16,645
Yes, sir.

245
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:20,145
The length of the strip of flower

246
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:23,545
and a brand new straw wrapper was the same.

247
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,645
The same?

248
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,045
Strange.

249
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,745
Since Inspector Shiratori had torn off a piece,

250
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,745
it should be a bit short.

251
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,345
That's because...

252
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:36,545
When you left the theater once,

253
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:39,945
you took the cup with the sleeping drug inside it with you,

254
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,345
and when you came back in again,

255
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:45,545
you pasted a new strip of flowers onto the new cup.

256
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:48,045
So, she presumed that she would be investigated on it later.

257
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,645
Yes.

258
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,945
In other words, the crime was committed this way...

259
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,145
First, she becomes friendly with someone

260
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:54,345
who has come to watch the movie before it starts

261
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:57,045
in order to get herself an alibi.

262
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,345
She inserts a sleeping drug into the cup

263
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:00,645
of the person who sits next to her.

264
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,845
After confirming that the person had fallen asleep,

265
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,845
she places her hat on that person's head

266
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:07,645
then switches her cup

267
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,745
with the one the sleeping drug is inside,

268
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:12,245
and places the cell phone on the cup.

269
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,345
She takes the cup with the sleeping drug inside

270
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,845
out of the theater when she sneaks out.

271
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:19,745
She returns home on a cab,

272
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:22,845
and strikes Mr. Somei who is waiting there to death.

273
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,045
Right after that,

274
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,545
she call her own cell phone

275
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,745
that she had left behind at the theater,

276
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:29,045
using Mr. Somei's phone.

277
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,645
Then she makes the people

278
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:33,345
who will establish her alibi watch this

279
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:35,345
so that they will testify for her.

280
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:36,645
Then all she has left to do is to dispose of the cup

281
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,445
with the sleeping drug inside it and the murder weapon somewhere,

282
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,345
go back to the theater by cab,

283
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,945
take her hat off the person who is sitting next to her

284
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:45,845
and switch the cup that has her cell phone on it

285
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,845
with a new cup with the strip of flower on it.

286
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:54,845
She went out of the way to stick a new strip of flowers on the cup

287
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,545
because I tore the strip of flower off

288
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:00,445
not from the edge, but from part way.

289
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:04,145
It's most likely that she mistakenly thought that

290
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:06,745
she had torn off a part of the strip when she was sticking it on.

291
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,145
If she left it cut off as is,

292
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,245
when she is investigated,

293
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:12,145
it would disclose that the cup had been switched.

294
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:15,445
That's probably why she stuck a new strip on.

295
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:18,045
What's the big fuss about a measly strip of flower?

296
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,045
If you want to set me up as a criminal,

297
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,445
why don't you bring the cab driver

298
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:25,045
who drove me over here right this minute?

299
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,845
I'm sure they'll find that driver soon.

300
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,045
Because there's no doubt

301
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:34,845
that you rode a cab while the movie was playing.

302
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:36,545
I mean, you didn't know

303
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,745
that there was an earthquake during the movie, right?

304
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,545
Earthquake?

305
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:42,845
There was one, wasn't there?

306
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:45,745
Yeah! A pretty big one too.

307
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,945
It was right after the scene where Gomera's organs came in view.

308
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,845
I was so scared, I clinged on tight to Conan!

309
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,245
Well, it's no surprise if you were riding a car

310
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,845
and didn't notice the earthquake, though.

311
00:16:57,845 --> 00:17:00,545
I... I just forgot to mention it!

312
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:03,645
Because I was upset over his death.

313
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:07,645
What? What's with all of you?

314
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:10,845
Why this sudden change in attitude?

315
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:14,245
Even you stood up for me in the beginning!

316
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:15,645
Hey!

317
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,345
When Inspector Megure asked me

318
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,945
about your alibi a while ago...

319
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:24,145
No.

320
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:27,945
I seem to have been sleeping just then.

321
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:29,645
I found the yarn from your hat on my hand

322
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:33,145
after I scratched my head.

323
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:37,145
That's why there's a high possibility

324
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:40,245
that you'll find my hair

325
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,545
on the inside of your hat.

326
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:52,845
Is that so?

327
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,145
Go ahead.

328
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:58,145
Then...

329
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:04,945
Go ahead and check it if you want to!

330
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,645
I'm sure you'll find what you want.

331
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:11,945
The frizzy hair of that police detective that puts on airs!

332
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,845
You admit that you committed the crime, then?

333
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,545
Yes, I killed him!

334
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,545
That revolting swindler!

335
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,645
Swindler?

336
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:29,045
I started going with that guy seven years ago.

337
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:31,445
When I was 20.

338
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,245
That guy was always in need of money

339
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:38,745
and who knows how much I gave him.

340
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:42,245
When I told him I had no more money I could give him,

341
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,445
he started saying that he wanted to

342
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:45,945
take the accessory I had to the pawn shop.

343
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:48,345
I gave it to him once,

344
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:49,945
but since it was my mother's keepsake,

345
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:52,245
I went to the pawn shop to get it back,

346
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:56,045
but was told that no one turned something like that in.

347
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:59,645
I got suspicious and followed him.

348
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:03,145
And that's when I saw.

349
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:07,545
A woman wearing the ring that was my mother's keepsake.

350
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:11,045
I found out later that she had been going with him from two years

351
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,645
before I even met him,

352
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:16,645
and that she was engaged to him too.

353
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:19,945
Why didn't you report it to the police?

354
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:23,245
That's indeed a case of swindling.

355
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,245
Telling the police would only get that guy arrested.

356
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:30,745
I won't get back the seven years that I lost.

357
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:34,945
That's why I put an end to that guy's life!

358
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,745
As punishment for wasting seven years of my young and beautiful life,

359
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:41,145
as well as spending all my cash!

360
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:46,345
Well, I never thought that the police was of any good,

361
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:49,045
so I figured I had to do it myself.

362
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:55,545
Okay, let's go.

363
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:57,145
It's too bad.

364
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:04,245
You were not like that before.

365
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:08,145
Huh? Did you know me before?

366
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:12,345
Yes. I doubt you remember, though.

367
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:21,745
Let me tell you then.

368
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:26,045
It's a man's ego that makes them think that women don't change!

369
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:29,245
But, we do. Depending on what happens,

370
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,945
we go from angels to devils!

371
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:37,145
Like they say, a woman's heart is as changeable as the autumn sky!

372
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:43,145
That lady is really cruel.

373
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:44,645
She really went overboard.

374
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,545
What's an ego?

375
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,545
It's being selfishly one-track minded.

376
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:57,245
Are you all right?

377
00:20:57,245 --> 00:21:00,545
Inspector Shiratori has so many things going on at once.

378
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:03,845
Hey, do you want me to go call Officer Sato?

379
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,045
I know her phone number.

380
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,145
No, please don't do that.

381
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:14,745
Never mind. Just leave me alone.

382
00:21:14,745 --> 00:21:16,445
Here you go.

383
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:17,645
Huh?

384
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:20,245
It's a reward for arresting the criminal.

385
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,545
I made it with a straw wrapper a while ago!

386
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:24,945
This is...

387
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,545
cherry blossom.

388
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:28,945
A cherry blossom

389
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:31,945
is the mark that all people of the police have on them!

390
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:34,845
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

391
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,945
a flower of justice!

392
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,645
Who told you that?

393
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,545
Ms. Kobayashi!

394
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:46,945
She taught me how to make it the other day.

395
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:48,445
Excuse me.

396
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,745
Who's Ms. Kobayashi?

397
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:53,145
I heard that the children of my class are here,

398
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,045
so I've come for them.

399
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:21,961
It's Ms. Kobayashi!

400
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:24,561
Then, please take care of them.

401
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:26,961
Yes, sir. I'll take the cab and see them home.

402
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:28,961
No.

403
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,461
If it's okay with you, let's take my car.

404
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,861
Yes, sir.

405
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,061
Thank you.

406
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:40,861
On top of the children having been a bother,

407
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:43,261
thank you so much for driving them home.

408
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:46,061
No problem at all.

409
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,361
An unexpected happy ending I'd say.

410
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,261
Yeah.

411
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:55,461
Cherry blossoms bloom, as they say.

412
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,540
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,380
"Nail art".

414
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,800
The next title

415
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,440
refers to a crime that cannot be solved, right?

416
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,740
What?
