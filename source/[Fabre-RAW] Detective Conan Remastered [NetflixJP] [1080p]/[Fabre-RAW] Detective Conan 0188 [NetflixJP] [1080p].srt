1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,940
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,840
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,540
Today's episode is the first in a series of mind boggling mysteries.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,240
We'll start with the adventures of these guys.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,390
Not once, but twice.

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,590
Who are you, brave sir who has rescued me?

10
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,390
Valiant nameless knight dressed in black.

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,290
If you wish to grant me my wish,

12
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,390
please remove that jet black mask

13
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,090
and show yourself to me.

14
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,590
If that is what the princess wishes,

15
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,790
I will reveal my ugly scarred-face to you

16
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,590
beneath the light of this moon!

17
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,990
Good grief! Dad, be serious!

18
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,690
There's not too much time left before my school play!

19
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,090
Give me a break!

20
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,090
Nobody can say these lines

21
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,090
with a straight face, it's so unnatural.

22
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,290
Who in the blazes wrote this syrupy script reading the script anyway?

23
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,190
It was Sonoko!

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,990
She said she wrote the part for the black knight with Shinichi in mind.

25
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,090
That Sonoko...

26
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,790
Hey, wait a minute!

27
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,290
It says right here that the knight and princess kiss passionately!

28
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,690
What?

29
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,990
Oh, come on. It's just pretend, don't worry about it!

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,490
Hey, Ran.

31
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,690
Who's going to do it? You know, that knight's part.

32
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,090
Why, are you that curious?

33
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,390
Well, just a little...

34
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,190
I'll bet you got some goofy kid to do the part.

35
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,390
Actually, it's somebody you both know very well.

36
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,590
Remember, you met him during one of your cases.

37
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,190
It's our school doctor, Dr. Araide.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,290
All the boys in our school were too embarrassed to do it.

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,190
So, we asked Dr. Araide when he came by to give us our physical exams.

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,490
-Huh? -Huh?

41
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,790
It seems he played a lot of leads in school plays in his days,

42
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,090
that's why he's so good at it.

43
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,890
He says the lines well and he knows how to handle women.

44
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,890
Hey! I won't allow it!

45
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,090
No, no! Don't do it, Ran

46
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,490
Just kidding.

47
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,690
He's just overlooking our rehearsals.

48
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,990
Sonoko's going to dress like a man to play the part of the knight.

49
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,790
Oh, I see.

50
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,890
How stupid.

51
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,190
Oh, no! Look at the time.

52
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,590
I've got practice in the morning, so I've got to take a bath.

53
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,490
The bath is not working.

54
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,390
What? I wanted to take a bath, too

55
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,090
Then, why don't you two go to the public bath?

56
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,890
But I'm sure it's closed today.

57
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,890
Why don't we go and ask Dr. Agasa to let us use his bath then?

58
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,590
I was going there tonight anyway to talk about our camping trip this weekend.

59
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,090
Really? Come on, let's go!

60
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,690
I'll go get my change of clothes.

61
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,490
Me, too.

62
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,790
Good grief.

63
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,800
You don't want to trouble the man too much,

64
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,990
so take your baths together and come home right away, you hear?

65
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,290
You...

66
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,590
You've got to be kidding!

67
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,390
Why do I have to take a bath with Conan?

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,890
I meant to say that it wouldn't be proper.

69
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,790
Isn't that night, Conan?

70
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,990
I guess...

71
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:44,190
"Perilous Return: Detectives In The Cave"

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,890
Something's strange.

73
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,990
Lately, Ran has been...

74
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,390
Huh? What are you talking about?

75
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,290
Sometimes I can feel it

76
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,190
Something Ran's eyes and the way she treats me,

77
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,090
it isn't way a person treats a seven year old,

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,490
it's like...

79
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,390
Come on now, Shinichi.

80
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,090
Well, it could just be my imagination I suppose.

81
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,190
Maybe she knows?

82
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,890
About who you really are.

83
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,690
Ai...

84
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,990
I have something to do in the basement, it'll take me until morning.

85
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,590
So, don't disturb me.

86
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,190
Hey, what if Ai is right...

87
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,290
Impossible.

88
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,090
If she was suspicious, why wouldn't she ask me about it?

89
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,790
That's the way Ran is.

90
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,990
Huh?

91
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,390
What about me?

92
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,490
Well, no...

93
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,090
By the way, where is Ai?

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,290
Ai is in the basement.

95
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,890
I think I'll go say hello.

96
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,990
Hey, Ran.

97
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,890
Wait.

98
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,790
Hello!

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,690
Ai...

100
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,190
Hey, why don't you say hello?

101
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,290
It's all right, Doctor. I shouldn't have bother her.

102
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,090
Well, I'll see you later, Ai.

103
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,690
Could it be...

104
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,190
that I'm running away?

105
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,090
That's ridiculous.

106
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,490
"It's the new century"

107
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,190
Let's start again. One, two..

108
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,590
Hey, Doc.

109
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,590
About our conversation the other day regarding Ran...

110
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,490
Can you make a handy robot just in case of an emergency?

111
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,390
What kind did you have in mind?

112
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,190
You know, something that moves and sounds

113
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,290
exactly me like a robot.

114
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,790
If I could make something like that,

115
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,490
I'd already be a millionaire.

116
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,290
I guess you're right.

117
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,290
There, the tent is up.

118
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,990
We didn't forget the tent today.

119
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,290
Ai and I will build stove,

120
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,290
so why don't you kids go get some wood for the fire?

121
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,090
Okay!

122
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,690
Tonight we're going to have barbeque, a barbeque.

123
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,790
You guys! I think we've got enough, let's go back!

124
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,790
-Okay! -Okay!

125
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,190
Hey, guys! Come over here.

126
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,990
I found something interesting.

127
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,790
It's just a limestone cave.

128
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,990
The sign says "Do Not Enter-Danger".

129
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,990
The words on this is what caught my attention.

130
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,490
Follow the dragon's path

131
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,690
and a glow of supreme bliss will shine on you.

132
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,590
Glow of supreme bliss?

133
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,190
A glow that makes you very happy.

134
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,590
Do you think it means...

135
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,190
Treasure?

136
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,690
Oh, here we go again.

137
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,990
The catch is this big "to" carved in the stone.

138
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,890
To... tokujo Unaju.

139
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,090
-Topaz. -Tonneru (tunnel).

140
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,090
Tokugawa buried treasure.

141
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,790
I was just kidding.

142
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,890
Hey, come back here guys.

143
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,290
Don't worry, we're just going to check it out!

144
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,190
Oh, for goodness sakes.

145
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,290
This sure is a huge cave.

146
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,190
It's a limestone cave.

147
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,090
I didn't think it'd be so big inside.

148
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,390
Cigarettes?

149
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,390
The filter is still damp.

150
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,290
I wonder if someone besides us is in here?

151
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,090
What's keeping them?

152
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,490
Where did they went off to?

153
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,290
They probably exploring the forest.

154
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,590
After all, their leader's very curious detective.

155
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,290
Anyway, never mind them. Give me a hand here.

156
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,990
Look at that, it's a light.

157
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,590
Somebody's over there.

158
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,890
Could it be the person who was smoking?

159
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,390
Maybe somebody's already found the treasure before us?

160
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,790
-Seriously? -Genta!

161
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,290
Darn it, we should've come in here earlier.

162
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,190
Then, the treasure would've been ours.

163
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,390
What's the matter, Genta?

164
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,390
A... body.

165
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,690
Huh?

166
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,290
-Why you... -A gun?

167
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,490
Get down!

168
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,790
Hey! What's going on?

169
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,690
Kids! Some kids saw us!

170
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,790
Good grief, you think their parents are with them?

171
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,690
No, it was only the four kids.

172
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,890
Darn it! What a run of bad luck.

173
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,290
First, we robbed the bank, but one of us gets our face seen.

174
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,590
So we had to kill him and we figured if we buried him in here, nobody would find out who we were.

175
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,790
But now, those kids saw us.

176
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,290
Never mind, we've got to get those kids!

177
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,690
Darn it! Where did they go?

178
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,490
Hey, what are we going to do when we find those kids?

179
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,190
Isn't it obvious?

180
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,690
We're going to put them to eternal sleep here in this dark tomb.

181
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,790
We'll blow a hole through their little heads.

182
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,290
You get to the entrance!

183
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,490
Both of us will search around here a little longer.

184
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,390
Hey, Haibara! Can you hear me?

185
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,490
Haibara?

186
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,490
Haibara! Answer me!

187
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,490
Haibara!

188
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,290
Answer me if you can hear me, Haibara!

189
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,890
Haibara!

190
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,290
Look at this, I don't believe you've been cooking your own meals.

191
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,690
Don't tease me!

192
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,290
I wonder what they're doing?

193
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,690
Maybe the switch is off?

194
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,690
I know! I'll go tell those guys that we didn't see anything.

195
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,390
That won't help!

196
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,090
Conan will think of a good idea...

197
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,490
Isn't that right, Conan?

198
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,890
-Conan? -Conan...

199
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,580
Conan...

200
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,180
What's the matter? Why are you bleeding?

201
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,680
Don't tell me that the bullet he shot hit you?

202
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,780
Conan, we've got to get out of here right away

203
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,580
before those bad men come back.

204
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,480
Wait... Ai and Doctor are out there waiting for us.

205
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,680
Sooner or later, they'll come in this cave to look for us.

206
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
If they come in not knowing what's happening,

207
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,480
those bad men will kill them.

208
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,080
We've got to warn that this cave is dangerous.

209
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,480
But how do we that?

210
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,780
If we write a note and those bad guys find it,

211
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,680
they'll just rip it up!

212
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,880
I guess we'll just have to keep going deeper inside

213
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,280
and keep trying to reach them ith the badge.

214
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,380
Don't be stupid!

215
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,780
If we go in any deeper,

216
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,480
the radio waves won't reach that far.

217
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,580
Then, what are we going to do?

218
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,180
We're going to use these transmitters,

219
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,580
the ones we use to track criminals.

220
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,580
There's a seal on the back, we can peel back about 10...

221
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,180
But what are we going to use them for?

222
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,880
I don't have time to explain.

223
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,580
Just do what I tell you.

224
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,480
Now hurry, take this...

225
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,280
Where did those kids go?

226
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,780
Hey! Did you find them?

227
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,680
No, it didn't look like they made it to the entrance

228
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,480
or to the outside.

229
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
That's strange.

230
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,880
We already searched around here.

231
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
The only place we haven't looked

232
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
is the way that goes deeper in the cave.

233
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,880
That saves us the trouble of going after them.

234
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,580
Those kids are dead.

235
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,980
I hear the inside of this cave is a giant maze,

236
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,680
a lot of people have died without ever finding their way out.

237
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,980
No, we're going to go after them!

238
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,180
We've got take care of all loose ends.

239
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,880
And it looks like those kids did head inside.

240
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,080
-Glasses? -Those could be...

241
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,480
from somebody else who got lost in here though.

242
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,480
You fool! Look at this.

243
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,880
Blood! It's blood!

244
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,580
Yes, and it's still damp.

245
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,780
I get it.

246
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,980
That means we'll catch up to those kids in no time.

247
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Yes, that's right.

248
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,180
Hey.

249
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,780
Don't you think they're too late?

250
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Huh? I guess so.

251
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,580
I'm going to go look in the woods.

252
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Hey, wait!

253
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,680
Ai!

254
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,280
Are you all right, Conan?

255
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,580
Yes, fine.

256
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,880
Now that I put a huge bandage on it.

257
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,480
By the way, Genta, can't you walk any faster?

258
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,180
Those guys might going catch up to us.

259
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,780
But...

260
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,280
I thought it'd hurt if I rocked you too much.

261
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,580
This is all my fault.

262
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,380
If I hadn't come inside

263
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,080
and said it wouldn't hurt to check it out,

264
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Conan wouldn't have got hurt.

265
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,380
No, it's not your fault, Ayumi!

266
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,580
I started it, I shouldn't found this cave in the first place.

267
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,380
You dummy! You know it was my fault.

268
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,380
I got carried away and happened to see those guys with the body.

269
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,080
Idiot.

270
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,180
If you hadn't come inside this cave,

271
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,780
a murder would've gone unsolved.

272
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,080
But thanks to you, we know who the killers are.

273
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,980
Now, as soon as we get away from those guys,

274
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,180
we've got a barbeque to cook!

275
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,580
Let's be optimistic about this!

276
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,780
Right...

277
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,180
Everybody, come quick!

278
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,980
It splits into two here.

279
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,380
You're right.

280
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,880
What should we do?

281
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,780
Let's use rock-paper-scissors to decide.

282
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,680
Genta, hand me the wristwatch light.

283
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
Come on, hurry!

284
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Oh, sure!

285
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,380
Hey, kids! Where are you!

286
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,580
Hey, answer me!

287
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,480
Look. It's wood for the fire.

288
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,280
What?

289
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Four piles stacked neatly in front of the cave.

290
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,980
That means those kids

291
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,780
are inside this cave.

292
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,880
What's this, the road splits?

293
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,180
Darn it! Which way did they go?

294
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,380
Hey! What's that?

295
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Something's shining.

296
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,580
It's a wristwatch with a light.

297
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,280
Those kids have fancy stuff.

298
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Then we're on the right track, those kids went this way...

299
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
Wait.

300
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,180
It's a trap.

301
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,680
Think about it.

302
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,880
They may be only kids

303
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,180
but do you think they wouldn't notice

304
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,580
if they dropped something with a light?

305
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,680
And they were thoughtful enough to tuck the belt away.

306
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,080
They made it look like they went this way,

307
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,980
but actually, they went that way.

308
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,380
Darn it!

309
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,780
Those kids think they're so smart.

310
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,180
I'm getting curious,

311
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,980
I can't wait to see what those kids look like.

312
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,180
Yes. Their faces full of fear,

313
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,680
begging for their life!

314
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,680
Are you sure it'll work?

315
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,180
You know, deliberately leaving the watch

316
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,080
showing them we came this way.

317
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,680
Yes, I'm sure those guys are going the other way.

318
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,080
Those men robbed a bank,

319
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm sure there's at least one smart guy among them.

320
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,080
But what happens if they split in two groups

321
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,580
and come this way, too?

322
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,880
It won't happen.

323
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,680
They can't even use a transmitter in this cave,

324
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,480
they know it could cost them their life if they split up.

325
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
Look, a fish!

326
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,880
What?

327
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Hey, does that fish have eyes?

328
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,680
Yes, it does.

329
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,280
I think it's a sweetfish.

330
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,380
What? What was that?

331
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,580
Are we going to eat it?

332
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,180
No, you silly!

333
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,780
We're not running away without thinking up a plan.

334
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,180
Huh?

335
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,280
Fish that live in caves have no eyes,

336
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,780
if this fish has eyes,

337
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,280
there's a good chance it swam in here from some river.

338
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,580
I'm saying that if we move upstream his underground river...

339
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,380
Maybe we'll find a way out...

340
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
That's right.

341
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,980
These are Kudo's, aren't they?

342
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,080
Yes.

343
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,280
Then, they must have gotten Iost in here after all.

344
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,780
But why did he leave them here?

345
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,680
This is terrible, we've got to find them right away.

346
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,180
Wait!

347
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,880
Something's on the ground around here a lot of them.

348
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,080
What?

349
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,680
These are the button shaped transmitters.

350
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,880
Don't touch them!

351
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,680
I think they form a shape.

352
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,580
A shape?

353
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,780
Let me reduce the transmission area.

354
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,980
This is...

355
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,780
An emergency?

356
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Hey, what is this? It's a dead end!

357
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,080
Those kids!

358
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,780
They pulled one on us!

359
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,180
Hurry, let's head back and find them!

360
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm going to kill them!

361
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
No way...

362
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,080
I don't believe this...

363
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,580
We couldn't possibly get out through there.

364
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
The fish does seem to come from here though.

365
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,580
Does that mean we'll never get out alive?

366
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,880
No way!

367
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,080
It's too early to give up hope.

368
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Huh?

369
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
Look, the roots of a tree are growing through the roof of the cave.

370
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
That means we're right under the surface of the ground.

371
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,480
The way out is probably very close by.

372
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
But I don't see any way to get out.

373
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,280
It's an egg!

374
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,480
There's something like a giant egg here.

375
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,180
It's just an egg shaped rock on top of another rock.

376
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,180
What a bummer.

377
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
We've come to a very strange place.

378
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,280
Yes, the path splits into five.

379
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,980
I wonder which one leads to the way out.

380
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,180
That's strange.

381
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,580
It isn't natural for a rock Iike that to rest on another rock.

382
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,680
Someone put it there deliberately.

383
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,380
But for what reason?

384
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,280
Look at that!

385
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
Something's carved on it.

386
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,580
"Those lost in the darkness, follow the dragon's path

387
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,480
and a glow of supreme bliss will shine upon you."

388
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,080
Those lost in the darkness?

389
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,180
It's almost the same words we found

390
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,080
on the stone monument outside.

391
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,980
Bats!

392
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,380
Oh, no!

393
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,880
Those voices...

394
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,580
No doubt about it, it's those kids!

395
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,780
They're close by. Hurry!

396
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,980
Let's go!

397
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,280
Go away!

398
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,580
Don't move! Just keep still!

399
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,180
Bats that live in caves eat bugs.

400
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,180
That's why they respond to slight movements and sounds.

401
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,180
Ayumi, don't go finding anymore weird things.

402
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,280
-But... -No, we're lucky you did.

403
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,780
Bats that live in caves

404
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,780
nest no more than 300 meters from the entrance.

405
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:58,280
That means the way out is very close by.

406
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,680
-Are you sure? -Are you sure?

407
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,980
But...

408
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,880
Our problem is, we don't know which one of tunnels

409
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,980
leads to the way out.

410
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,480
If my deduction is right,

411
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,080
the dragon's path will show us, but...

412
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,980
Darn it, my eyes are getting fuzzy.

413
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,980
The key to the puzzle is

414
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,280
the huge "to" carved on the stone in front of the cave

415
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,880
and the words dragon's path,

416
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,380
and the egg shaped rock on top of the other rock.

417
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,280
"To", "dragon's path" and "egg"?

418
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,080
Then, let's try each of the tunnels.

419
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,580
No, we're only going to one.

420
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,480
Huh?

421
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
The words,

422
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,380
those lost in the darkness refers to those lost in the cave.

423
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,480
Glow of supreme bliss means the light of the way out.

424
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,780
That means the carvings on the stone in front of the cave

425
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,880
and on that rock are hints as how to get out of here.

426
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,380
The dragon's path that leads out is...

427
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,980
Is that...

428
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,780
Conan?

429
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,580
-Conan? -He's bleeding so badly!

430
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,680
-Footsteps! -Oh, no.

431
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,080
Those guys are coming!

432
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,280
What should we do?

433
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,460
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,100
"Shogi"

435
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,360
Next time, that person will do something crazy!

436
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,400
I think it's time to wake up from your dream.
