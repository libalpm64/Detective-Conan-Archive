1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,870
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,770
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,570
The mystery centers around the table.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,370
What's wrong with Ran?

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,160
With a dinner coupon that Ran won in a shopping mall lottery,

9
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,260
we are heading toward Chinatown in Yokohama.

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,360
There, we met people in the movie industry.

11
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,960
Mr. Kaizo Isogami, film director.

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,460
Mr. Motohiro Ito, assistant film director.

13
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,360
Mr. Keigo Kitaura, author of the book.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
And the producer Mr. Shiro Kawabata.

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,760
Circumstances led to us having dinner with them.

16
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,160
But, suddenly...

17
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,360
Mr. Kawabata died.

18
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,160
Poison was not found in his clothing.

19
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,560
Because chemical reaction was found on the plate

20
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,160
and towel that he used,

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Pops who sat beside him was suspected of planting cyanide.

22
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,560
This is ridiculous!

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,060
Why do I have to kill a man I met for the first time

24
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,760
at a restaurant I came for the first time?

25
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,260
What you say sound suspicious already!

26
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,960
What's superb timing for your daughter

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
to be asked to appear in the movie

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,260
at a restaurant you came for the first time!

29
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,760
It is true!

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,160
We came to this restaurant just by coincidence...

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,660
Huh?

32
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,960
Are you all right?

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,860
You look pale.

34
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm okay!

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,260
I was just a bit dizzy.

36
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,860
Why don't just sit over there?

37
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,660
Uncle will solve the case soon.

38
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Yeah. Thanks.

39
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,960
We're in trouble.

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Ran looks really sick.

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,160
We need to take her to a hospital soon.

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,660
"Chinatown Dejavu In The Rain (Part 2)"

43
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,060
Anyway, the killer replaced that poisoned towel.

44
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,360
After the soup was spilled, and the victim changed seats.

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,860
That means,

46
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,360
you were sitting to his right at that time

47
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,860
and are the prime suspect!

48
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,260
Hey, hey.

49
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,860
Hey, Inspector.

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,660
-Ran... -Inspector!

51
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,560
This bottle believed to have contained the poison was found

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,960
in the restroom.

53
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,260
What?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,160
I see. The towel was brought into the restroom

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
and laced with the poison.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,960
That's why, it's not me!

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,760
In that case, Uncle Kogoro is not the culprit!

58
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,160
'Cause Uncle hasn't been to the washroom since he arrived here.

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,960
So that's why, Inspector!

60
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,560
Also, Mr. Kawabata changed seats,

61
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,060
holding his towel he used to wipe the soup off.

62
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,860
That's why, nobody could have switched towels.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,760
No, there must be something to wait.

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,960
A way to switch without people noticing.

65
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,660
I see!

66
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,660
The killer used the rotation of the turntable.

67
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,260
If the cyanide-laced towel

68
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,160
is placed at the edge of the turntable

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
and it is rotated cleverly,

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,160
it can fall right in front of Mr. Kawabata.

71
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,460
How's that?

72
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,960
But, how?

73
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,760
If something like that falls, everybody will find it strange, right?

74
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,360
So, that's why it has to be done cleverly so nobody notices.

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360
If nobody sees it,

76
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,160
the speed with which the turntable

77
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,460
has to turn to drop off the towel

78
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,160
would make all the plates fall off, too.

79
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,560
In the first place,

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,160
who'd use such a towel when you have one yourself?

81
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,060
You're right.

82
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,260
Wait.

83
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,560
I remember when I tried to get the soy sauce and the chili oil,

84
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,360
the turntable rotated so many times, that they were hard to get.

85
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,160
The order of the dishes that were placed on the turntable

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,260
was in the clockwise direction.

87
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,760
The pork dish.

88
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,260
Beef and green peppers.

89
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,660
Crab and eggs.

90
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,260
Pitan.

91
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,560
Sweet and sour pork.

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,860
And the steamer lid.

93
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,560
The soy sauce was between the sweet and sour pork and the pitans,

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
and the chili oil was between the pork dish and the steamer lid.

95
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,860
At that time, the order of the seats was...

96
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,160
Starting with the victim Mr. Kawabata, in the clockwise direction.

97
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,260
Me, Ran,

98
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,860
Mr. Kitaura,

99
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,260
Mr. Ito, Mr. Isogami, and Pops.

100
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
And the soy sauce went back in front of Pops again and again.

101
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,360
And the chili oil went back in front of Mr. Kitaura.

102
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,660
Oh, yes, Mr. Kawabata said...

103
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,760
Actually, I'm allergic to eggs

104
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,560
and hate even the sight of it.

105
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,260
Hate even the sight of it?

106
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,560
Okay, work on this area with caution.

107
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,660
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,160
Excuse me, officer.

109
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,860
There's something I'd like to ask you.

110
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,360
What's that, kid?

111
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,560
If you checked the food, you must have checked the plates

112
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,760
-and the top of the table as well, right? -Yeah.

113
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
Then...

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,360
Did you check places like that?

115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,660
No, not yet.

116
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,160
Then, Uncle Kogoro is asking you to check it right away.

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,060
What? You mean Sleeping Kogoro?

118
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,260
Yes, also,

119
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,960
did you find anything funny on the towel with cyanide?

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,660
Huh? You mean other than the cyanide?

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Oh, yes!

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
There was a light brown stain!

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I sniffed it, and that's soup for sure.

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,060
You must have seen it, right?

125
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,560
Mr. Kawabata spilled the soup on his jeans

126
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,360
and wiped it with the towel, right?

127
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,860
It's a stain from the spill.

128
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,160
-Anything else? -What?

129
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,460
You found nothing else?

130
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,860
Oh, no.

131
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,460
Nothing special.

132
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Really?

133
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,660
Nothing else, right?

134
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,060
Then, I'll tell that to Uncle Kogoro.

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,860
I was right.

136
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,960
Mr. Kawabata was not killed by

137
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,360
switching his towel with the poisoned one.

138
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,260
The towel was switched after he was killed.

139
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,960
By that person.

140
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,460
If that is right, the evidence must still be there.

141
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,760
On that table.

142
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,160
Anyway!

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
The killer is the one who laced his own towel

144
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,960
with cyanide in the restroom

145
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,960
and switched it with the victim's towel at the table.

146
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,860
Yeah,

147
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,760
without attracting the attention of

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,660
Ran, Conan and me sitting on both sides.

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,160
But how? How can you do that?

150
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,860
Oh, yes! All three suspects are in the movie industry!

151
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,960
Maybe he used an invisible line used in special effects

152
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,460
to move the towel.

153
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,860
For goodness's sake.

154
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,460
They've got to turn down the air conditioning.

155
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,560
What is it, Inspector Yokomizo?

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,060
Well, there's something I heard from my brother.

157
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,460
Kogoro Mouri makes bizarre, out-of-place comments at first,

158
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,560
but it's only to fool people.

159
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,560
His attitude changes abruptly with a weird voice and dance.

160
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,160
As if a spirit takes hold of him.

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,960
But, of course, he can be exaggerating.

162
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,660
Oh, but...

163
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,460
Is that what your brother mean by...

164
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,460
a weird dance?

165
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,460
So, enough joking around.

166
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,660
Now, I would like you to take your seats.

167
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,560
At the same table the crime took place.

168
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,060
There was Mr. Ito, Mr. Isogami and Mr. Kitamura.

169
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,260
Then, I'll be able to tell you everything,

170
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,960
what happened during dinner.

171
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,160
It's happening! The Sleeping Kogoro detective show!

172
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,060
First, I would like to have

173
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,760
Inspector Yokomizo take a seat where the victim sat.

174
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,660
From his right, in the exact same seating arrangement,

175
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,460
there's me and Mr. Isogami.

176
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,560
Mr. Ito and Mr. Kitaura.

177
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,460
Next, at Ran's seat,

178
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,960
I'd like another police officer.

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Why?

180
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,460
My daughter is a bit indisposed.

181
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm all right.

182
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,960
I can do it.

183
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,960
Ran.

184
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,860
And Conan sits between Ran and the victim.

185
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,860
Now that all the seats are taken,

186
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
I would like to hear an exclamation

187
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,760
of a mysterious incident that took place immediately

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
before the crime.

189
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
A mysterious incident?

190
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,760
Yes, the table. Somebody was moving the turntable,

191
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
trying to give me a hard time.

192
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,960
Look! Do you see the bottle of soy sauce

193
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,460
on the turntable right in front of Uncle Kogoro?

194
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,260
I moved the turntable to get the soy sauce.

195
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Each time I tried to get it,

196
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,460
it will return immediately in front of Uncle.

197
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,360
No matter how many times I do it.

198
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,860
The same thing happened

199
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,160
with the chili oil in front of Mr. Kitaura.

200
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,060
Each time the bottle came close to me,

201
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,060
it would go back to where it was right away.

202
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,360
This means that someone was having fun, giving me a hard time, right?

203
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Hey, Mr. Detective.

204
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,360
Is what the kid is saying related to the crime?

205
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,960
Hey. Tell me.

206
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
It's all right.

207
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,160
Uncle Kogoro said we don't have to do anything

208
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,660
for the culprit will expose himself.

209
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,460
Expose himself?

210
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,760
Here you are, little boy. Your bun!

211
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,560
Wow! Thank you!

212
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,460
Hey. Why now?

213
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,060
Oh, yes.

214
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,660
Detective Mouri ordered Chinese bun for this little boy.

215
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,960
Thank you! First, a big bite!

216
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
Stop!

217
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,660
What is it, Mr. Isogami?

218
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,160
Think!

219
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,560
Somebody got killed just now at this table!

220
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,360
Poison might still be found somewhere on the table!

221
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,360
And you allow a kid to eat with his hands here?

222
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,960
But, the forensics have already checked

223
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
-and did not find cyanide anywhere... -No!

224
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,060
Mr. Isogami is right.

225
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,260
There might still be cyanide.

226
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,760
Somewhere where we cannot see.

227
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,210
Don't fool around with me! Get to the point!

228
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,710
Who's the culprit, and where's the cyanide?

229
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,110
How would you turn it?

230
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,110
-What? -The turntable.

231
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,910
How? Of course, you place your hand like this.

232
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,010
Then, what would you do if plates are crowded

233
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,010
like this egg and crab dish and the pitan?

234
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,210
Well, in that case,

235
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,410
I'll pick up the edge of the turntable with my fingers.

236
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,510
Don't tell me that...

237
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,710
The cyanide is under the turntable?

238
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,710
No, wait.

239
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,510
There are a lot of problems here making the victim touch this.

240
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:53,010
What is Mr. Kawabata didn't like these two dishes?

241
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,810
What if he hates even the sight of them?

242
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,510
Is that right?

243
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,610
Yes.

244
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,210
Mr. Kawabata was allergic to eggs.

245
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,810
Now, Inspector Yokomizo, please check.

246
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,410
Right in front of you, seated at the victim's chair.

247
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,010
are the two dishes.

248
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,910
Now, where is the chili oil?

249
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,510
In... in front of Mr. Kitaura.

250
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,710
Yes, of course.

251
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,110
That's why, when the kid tried to get the chili oil,

252
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,810
the turntable was returned to the original position.

253
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,910
The victim would try to avoid the two dishes

254
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,410
and hold the table to moving around, again and again.

255
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,310
Well, it might be true for the chili oil.

256
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,810
But this time, the soy sauce is in front of the kid.

257
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,010
Why then did the table turn when he tried to get the soy sauce?

258
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,810
To get the victim to touch the cyanide,

259
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,810
you have to get the cyanide on that spot, right?

260
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,210
In addition, the cyanide must be

261
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,310
applied immediately before the Peking Duck is served,

262
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,810
a dish you have to eat with your fingers.

263
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,710
If you do that earlier, somebody might touch it accidentally.

264
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,010
Then, when the kid tried to get the soy sauce,

265
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,110
he had not applied the cyanide yet?

266
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,510
Right.

267
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,810
Most probably, the culprit tried to apply cyanide

268
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,110
on the underside of the turntable where the two plates were placed,

269
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,210
when the waiter could be seen bringing the Peking Duck.

270
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,210
He couldn't apply the cyanide

271
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,310
and turned the turntable again and again,

272
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,710
because Conan would rotate it.

273
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,810
You mean the person who had the two plates in front of him

274
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,710
when the soy sauce was in front of you is the...

275
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,710
Yes.

276
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,210
That person

277
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,310
killed Mr. Kawabata...

278
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,610
Here. Tonight.

279
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,410
Mr. Isogami!

280
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,610
Then, what was that towel with so much cyanide?

281
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,010
That was Mr. Isogami's towel.

282
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,060
He brought the towel to the restroom,

283
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,560
poured cyanide on it, and returned to his seat.

284
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,860
He applied the cyanide on that spot.

285
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,760
In the chaos that ensued when Mr. Kawabata lost consciousness,

286
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,560
he switched towels.

287
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,160
To make sure nobody notices the switch,

288
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160
he drenched his own towel with soup.

289
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,460
He wanted to make the towel look identical

290
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,560
to Mr. Kawabata's towel after he wipe the soup of his pants,

291
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,860
but you missed one small point

292
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,760
that Mr. Kawabata was wearing jeans.

293
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,360
Yes.

294
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,360
On Mr. Kawabata's towel that you switched,

295
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,660
along with the soup stain,

296
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,460
there was a blue stain from his jeans.

297
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,860
I get it.

298
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,660
If that towel is right in front of Mr. Isogami,

299
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,460
that is proof that he is the killer.

300
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,060
No. That towel is not proof enough.

301
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,160
There is the possibility that the towel

302
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,260
was placed there to frame Mr. Isogami.

303
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,260
But, you will confess, won't you? Mr. Isogami?

304
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,160
When Conan touch the place with cyanide just a while ago,

305
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,860
and he tried to eat the bun with those hands,

306
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,060
you stop him.

307
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,860
There is enough conscience...

308
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
left in you.

309
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,260
Conscience?

310
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,260
If that scoundrel who let Rika die had a bit of conscience,

311
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,460
I wouldn't be doing this.

312
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,160
Rika? You mean the girl who died a year ago?

313
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,660
But, that was an accident during the shoot.

314
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,160
It was no accident.

315
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,560
That was full-fledged murder.

316
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,860
He knew all along that Rika took over the stunt

317
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,660
in the last scene from the stunt pro.

318
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,760
Really?

319
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:40,460
He told me that he made her wish to do it on her own come true.

320
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
He said the movie became a hit, thanks to her,

321
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,460
grinning that evil grin.

322
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,660
We had so many opportunities to stop that.

323
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,260
But why?

324
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,560
You yourself snubbed her for being such a ham.

325
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,460
You're still green.

326
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,460
A director's job is a sad one.

327
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,360
When you keep on looking at the actress through the camera lens,

328
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,960
you fall in love with her.

329
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,260
No matter how amateurish.

330
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Or uncouth.

331
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
It just happens.

332
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,460
You'll never get to direct a film, if you don't understand that.

333
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
Okay, let's go.

334
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,460
We'll talk to you at the station.

335
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,360
Mr. Detective,

336
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sure you had already wiped off the cyanide.

337
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,860
But, what were you planning if I had pretended

338
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,460
not to know and let him die?

339
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,060
If I was a man like that scoundrel?

340
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,460
Then, I was planning to say something different to corner you.

341
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,460
And stop you from trying to make excuses.

342
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,460
I wanted to see that.

343
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:13,460
I have a gripe to whoever gave me this thing called conscience.

344
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,460
As a film director, I most certainly wanted

345
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,560
to see you interrogate ruthlessly.

346
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm not the one to believe in a god.

347
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,060
God?

348
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,060
Is there a god in this world?

349
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,960
That voice. Who?

350
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,660
That calm voice of a woman.

351
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,260
Who is it?

352
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,860
Ran?

353
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
Rain.

354
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,760
The noise of the rain is fading.

355
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,460
Should there?

356
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,660
I can hear.

357
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,660
Should there be a reason?

358
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,360
Should there be a reason?

359
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,160
Is there a god?

360
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,560
Japanese?

361
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,360
No. The angel did not smile at me.

362
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,760
Get out!

363
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,860
Not even once.

364
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,460
Sharon.

365
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,360
Yes.

366
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
That time,

367
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I met her.

368
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,260
With Shinichi.

369
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
That...

370
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Ran!

371
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,460
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,100
"Stage costume"

373
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,680
We are in New York, again.

374
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,680
A case from a while back.
