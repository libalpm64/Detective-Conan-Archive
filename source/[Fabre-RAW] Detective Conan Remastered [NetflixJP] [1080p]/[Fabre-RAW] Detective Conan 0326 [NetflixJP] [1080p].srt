1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,240
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,340
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,040
Extra-marital affair, fortune-telling and Three Kingdoms.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,240
Many things connect to the crime.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,060
Heiji, Pops and I will go to the residence of Ryoko Morozumi

9
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,560
on Haidocho 4-chome to conduct investigation

10
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,360
on behalf of Detective Kusukawa,

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,860
but she denied our help.

12
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
What?

13
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,960
You just said you're headed home because you finished the job!

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,660
Yeah, that's what we were planning to do,

15
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,760
but we passed a fire engine on the way back.

16
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
We got concerned and headed back to the residence

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,160
and found it blazing outrageously.

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
What?

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,360
The Morozumi residence...

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,460
"Red Horse In The Fire (Investigation)"

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,660
I tell you, what is that idiot doing anyway.

22
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,860
I bought him a t-shirt

23
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,260
that I thought would look good on him and then...

24
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,060
Come, come. They'll be home soon.

25
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,260
What's this key holder?

26
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,460
Remember? A kindly looking old man gave it us on the bus.

27
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,660
Oh, the man who gave us his seat

28
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,060
saying that we looked to be carrying a heavy load.

29
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,260
Thank you so very much.

30
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,860
Thanks.

31
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,060
Where are you girls living?

32
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,560
Are you trying to pick us up, mister?

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Kazuha, stop it!

34
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,960
No. I run an antique shop at Haidocho,

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,060
so I thought I'd like you to drop in one day.

36
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,060
Haidocho is nearby.

37
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,460
My house is right next to it on Beikacho 5-chome.

38
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,560
"Takanori Genda (42)" -Oh, 5-chome.

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,060
-Shall we go tomorrow? -Okay, let's!

40
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,660
Okay, I'll give you the catalog of my shop and a key holder.

41
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,460
Promise, okay?

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,860
I wonder what a key holder

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,260
that brings flourishing business is all about.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,460
"Police Headquarters" -Here you go, Mouri.

45
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,260
The four red horses that were found at the serial arson sites.

46
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,960
I went way out to ask the forensic officers for it,

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,760
so you'd better find some sort of a clue, or you're going to get it.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,560
Well, I'm not the one who want to see the horses, they do.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,060
Hey. I wonder why only the horse left at the first site

50
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,760
is burnt black like this?

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,660
And only this horse has a stand.

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,560
There's something written on the back of the stand.

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
Rabbit?

54
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,660
Hey. A red horse and rabbit...

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,160
Don't tell me that...

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,660
Hey. Isn't this Guan Yu?

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,360
Guan Yu is the military commander

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,860
who appears in the story "Three Kingdoms", isn't he?

59
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,060
Yes. And Guan Yu is also famous

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,160
for being the god of prosperity for doing business.

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,460
But, what a flashy colored horse he's riding.

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,960
Well, this is the Red Rabbit Horse.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,860
It's a super horse said to be able to run a thousand miles in a day.

64
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,560
Red Rabbit Horse?

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,260
Are you saying that this red plastic horse

66
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,460
is a famous horse that appears in "Three Kingdoms"?

67
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,860
Yeah, that's right.

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,460
Try looking at the stand of this horse

69
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,960
that was left at the first scene of the fire.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,260
You can't read the words above and under it because they're burnt,

71
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,260
but you can see the word "rabbit", right?

72
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,460
Yes, true.

73
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,860
The only red horse with the word "rabbit" to its name

74
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,960
is the horse that ran around battlefields

75
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,760
with its vicious military commander on its back, Red Rabbit Horse, right?

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,860
But, why did the arsonist put the legendary horse

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,160
that appears in an old Chinese story

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,760
at the sites he set fire to?

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Yeah, why?

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
China...

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,760
Feng Shui is also from China, isn't it?

82
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,760
The man who came to the Morozumi residence before the fire,

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,560
didn't he say anything to Ryoko about the old Chinese story?

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,060
He didn't say anything about the "Three Kingdoms",

85
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,060
but that Sensei of Feng Shui's got a perfect motive.

86
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,160
Huh?

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,560
He was looking for the video tape of his affair

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
with Ryoko Morozumi who died in the fire.

89
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
"Misao Soga (45)"

90
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,860
Don't tell me that you think he set the house on fire

91
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,460
in order to destroy the tape in the process?

92
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,160
Inspector Yuminaga.

93
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,660
Okay. If you find out anything more, please report to me again.

94
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,960
Yes, sir.

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,660
It seems that the ones with motive is not limited to that Sensei.

96
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,360
Keiko Gondo, the fortune-teller

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
that came to the house before the Sensei...

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,260
Seems that she's going to get a large sum of estate from her parents

99
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,760
being that she's Ryoko's older sister.

100
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,160
Come to think of it, that fortune-teller

101
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,860
was saying that their father just died.

102
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,860
But that lady came to borrow money from Ryoko.

103
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,660
If she was going to inherit the estate of her father anyway,

104
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,460
why would she do something like that?

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,160
Her father was left to live alone when her mother died.

106
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
His only living relatives were his two daughters, Ryoko and Keiko.

107
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,660
He seems to have left a will saying that

108
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,960
he would leave his entire estate to Ryoko who had taken a husband,

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,460
who took after their family name Morozumi.

110
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,860
I see.

111
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,960
So if Ryoko disappears,

112
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,260
the estate that she originally couldn't inherit would be hers.

113
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,360
Yeah.

114
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
Because there was nothing on the death note that said,

115
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,760
if the younger sister dies, don't give it to the older sister.

116
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,460
If so, Ryoko's husband is clean.

117
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,960
If his wife dies, he loses the estate and all.

118
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,360
No, we can't assume that.

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,060
Her husband Akira Morozumi is a psychiatrist,

120
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,160
and wanted to demolish that house that they were living in

121
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,060
and build his own hospital.

122
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,560
But since Ryoko was opposed to it,

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,960
he seems to have been in a fix.

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,460
He seems to have been given that land and house by Ryoko's parents.

125
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,160
On top of that, if he knew that

126
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,560
his wife was having an extra-marital affair,

127
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,460
he would have more than enough motive.

128
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,260
The problem is all three of them have an alibi.

129
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,460
Yeah. The time the arsonist set fire

130
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,960
and put this horse at the site was around 7:30 pm.

131
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,260
Her husband came home about 10 minutes before that,

132
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,860
but after that, before even a minute had passed,

133
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,360
he went out drinking with the Sensei of Feng Shui.

134
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,260
And at that time, the fortune-teller

135
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,960
was telling fortunes in a building in front of Haido Station.

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,460
The only suspect left is

137
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,860
the man who was at the front door

138
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,260
of the Morozumi residence when we got there.

139
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,060
The man who tried to leave the catalog of the things in his store

140
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,460
and key holder that would help business prosper,

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,060
but was asked to leave.

142
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,760
The owner of the antique store, that timid looking man...

143
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
Unless we can figure out who and where he is...

144
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,860
Hey. I wonder what this is?

145
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,060
See, this horse that was found at the first fire site,

146
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,260
only this horse has a strange protrusion on its body.

147
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,560
Isn't this the feet of a human?

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
It's melted from the heat of the fire,

149
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,460
but maybe somebody was mounted on this horse.

150
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,360
The military commander that was riding the Red Rabbit Horse was...

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,060
Who was he?

152
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,960
Guan... Guan Yu!

153
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Guan Yu?

154
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
He's really suspicious after all,

155
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,460
that timid man with the round rim glasses.

156
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Guan Yu is the god of prosperity in business.

157
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,260
The key holder box that the man tried to give away

158
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,460
is just the right size for this, too.

159
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,260
There's no doubt about it.

160
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,460
Huh? The guy that was riding the Red Rabbit Horse was...

161
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,960
We don't have time to waste!

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,460
Let's call all the antique shops in the vicinity of Haidocho!

163
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,560
We'd better hurry or he'll get away!

164
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,260
I hope that the man you guys say you saw isn't him.

165
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,360
Oh, no! It's already past 23:00!

166
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,560
We're all supposed to go to Tropical Land tomorrow and yet!

167
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,460
Maybe they aren't planning to come home?

168
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,260
Really, what are they doing dragging Conan around with them

169
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,060
till this hour of the day?

170
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,360
They get me so mad!

171
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Let's just forget about those guys and go to sleep.

172
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,760
Wait.

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Why don't we hang this sunny boy doll out

174
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,060
on the veranda of dad's room so that it doesn't rain tomorrow?

175
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,460
Although it didn't seem to work last night.

176
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,260
I'm going to wish with all my might tonight so that it works.

177
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah.

178
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,460
I've found them.

179
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,260
I've finally found them.

180
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,860
What? He once came up as a suspect?

181
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,260
Are you serious?

182
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,560
Yeah. His name is Takanori Genda.

183
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,460
He's running an antique shop in Haidocho, just as you assumed.

184
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,560
But why'd you suspect him?

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,360
He was among the crowd of onlookers at the fire site at Rizencho.

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,960
He was mumbling something strange while watching the fire.

187
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
He was saying, "Father..."

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
Father?

189
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,760
His father used to be a firefighter.

190
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,360
When he was still in elementary school,

191
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,060
his father tried to save a person

192
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,660
who couldn't make it out of the fire in time,

193
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,560
and was swallowed by the flames.

194
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,460
Don't tell me that the man is...

195
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,960
Yeah. We, the police thought so, too.

196
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,460
That he set fire in memory of his father.

197
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,960
That, maybe he thought that if he caused a fire,

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,360
his father would come dashing to the scene.

199
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,960
I see. So, not being able to give up hope,

200
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,560
he started setting fires from 1-chome in sequence,

201
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,260
and kept chasing the illusion of his father.

202
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,860
What? At 5:00 in the evening,

203
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,560
he stopped by at the shop once and then went home?

204
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,760
Yes, he said he was tired.

205
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,560
He's been distributing catalogs of our store and key holders

206
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,960
to people in the neighborhood from morning, so...

207
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,560
Is that key holder the one with a person riding a red horse?

208
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,060
Yeah. It's his work of effort of the statue of Guan Yu.

209
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,960
But he changed it to another key holder

210
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,760
because it didn't take too well to others.

211
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
What? He changed it?

212
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,560
Yes. The key holder that he distributed today

213
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,760
should've been one of a beckoning cat.

214
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Is something wrong with the shop owner, officer?

215
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
No, not really.

216
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,960
Don't get so angry, Ran.

217
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,860
We can't go home for a while longer.

218
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,160
Gosh.

219
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You were pretty knowledgeable about the story "Three Kingdoms", right?

220
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,660
What? Yes.

221
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,360
The military commander who was mounted on the Red Rabbit Horse

222
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,260
was called Lu Bu, right?

223
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,360
Right. But later, the horse was given to Cao Cao

224
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,860
and in the end, it went to Guan Yu, who was the last to own it.

225
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,960
Are you sure about it?

226
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,460
Yes, because the key holder I was given of Guan Yu today

227
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,860
-is also riding a Red Rabbit Horse! -What?

228
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Somebody gave you a key holder of Guan Yu riding the Red Rabbit Horse?

229
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,160
Yes.

230
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,960
Hey, Pops! What's the address of your detective agency?

231
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,260
I'm asking you what's the address? What chome is it on?

232
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,960
Fifth chome.

233
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,660
Okay, I got it.

234
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,160
What did Pops say?

235
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,660
I'm not sure,

236
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,460
but he said he's on his way home now, and told us to not go outside.

237
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,160
Great.

238
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,860
I've been hearing strange noises from the front door from a while ago,

239
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,460
and it's giving me the creeps.

240
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,640
What? Genda lives in Rizencho?

241
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,340
Yeah. What about it?

242
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,640
When Ryoko's husband came back home at about 7:20 pm,

243
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,640
we saw Mr. Genda near the house in Haidocho.

244
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,740
The bus that Ran rode is probably the one

245
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,740
that goes from Haidocho via Beikacho and then to Rizencho.

246
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,240
Although it's true that Mr. Genda intended to go home once,

247
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
for one reason or another, he returned to that house.

248
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,640
Rizencho is the place where the first fire occurred, right?

250
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah. The house that burned was right near his home.

251
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,140
The inhabitant seems to have been a good friend of his parents,

252
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,940
as well as a good customer of his shop.

253
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,840
Which means that the real reason he set fire to the house

254
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,040
was to hide the fact that the item that he sold was fake,

255
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,440
and before anyone found out, he burned the house down.

256
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,240
Yeah.

257
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,840
But I don't understand.

258
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,340
Why didn't you detain him at the station

259
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,140
being as suspicious as he was?

260
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,640
I guess the intuition of a police detective within me

261
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,240
has gotten rusty.

262
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,940
The police car has arrived in front of the detective agency.

263
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,140
Hey, don't tell me that...

264
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,340
Genda?

265
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,940
-Heiji. -What is it? What happened?

266
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,640
After the phone call just a while ago, that man came here,

267
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,540
and asked to have the key holder that he gave us in the bus back.

268
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,940
We asked him why, and he said...

269
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,840
There's going to be a fire.

270
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,040
I'm going to set fire again!

271
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Then, he broke down in tears.

272
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,140
Having no choice, I called the police, but...

273
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Hey, Genda. Is it true?

274
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,240
Did you really do it?

275
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
I'm sorry!

276
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,740
Inspector Yuminaga!

277
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,640
We'll take the suspect over to the Beika Police Department for now.

278
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,540
Yeah.

279
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,140
Judging from the looks of it,

280
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,440
it seems he'll spit it out right away.

281
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,940
Hey, Hattori.

282
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,440
Doesn't this seem familiar?

283
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing.

284
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,040
The renown Detective Poirot series, a masterpiece of all masterpieces.

285
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,640
It's just like "The ABC Murders".

286
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,140
The killer kills people who have the same initials

287
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,040
as the name of the place

288
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,840
and kills them off one by one in order of ABC.

289
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Then, an ABC time schedule is placed near the corpse

290
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,340
to make it look as if it were the doings of a serial killer.

291
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,140
And finally, he kills the actual target "C" that he is after.

292
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,440
He hides the orderliness of a planned murder

293
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,340
under the guise of a disorderly random murder.

294
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,040
It sure is similar!

295
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
Moreover, that timid man, the arsonist,

296
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,840
who was taken away by the police just a while ago.

297
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,040
In that novel, he is arrested once because the real arsonist

298
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,240
puts him under the illusion that he is the one committing the crime.

299
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,040
Genda sure resembles that character.

300
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,840
It seems that we'd better look into this a little deeper.

301
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Yeah. We'd better check out the sites of the fire of 4-chome

302
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,740
that smells of tricks involved.

303
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,040
What? You're going to Haidocho 4-chome

304
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,640
where the fire occurred last night?

305
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
You mean now?

306
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,840
Yeah. There's something bothering me.

307
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm thinking of taking him along, too.

308
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,840
Never mind the fire!

309
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,340
We're all scheduled to go to Tropical Land today, aren't we?

310
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,740
I don't know if it's topical or pickles,

311
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,340
but this case is sure going to put us in a pickle

312
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,540
if we don't solve it fast.

313
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,940
Case?

314
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,040
But the arsonist was arrested last night, wasn't he?

315
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,940
Yeah! The man with the round rimmed glasses

316
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,840
that gave us the key holder of the red horse.

317
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:57,340
No. Maybe that man is being mind controlled.

318
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,640
Mind controlled?

319
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Think about it.

320
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Mr. Akira Morozumi is a psychiatrist.

321
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,540
Mr. Misao Soga is a Sensei of Feng Shui.

322
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,040
And Keiko Gondo is a fortune-teller.

323
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,940
All three of them seem to be able to manipulate the hearts of people,

324
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,140
and have the motive to cause the fire.

325
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,840
Don't you think something smells?

326
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,440
But those three have alibis.

327
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,640
Right, so let's go and check it out again.

328
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Maybe a super delicious story is hidden behind all this, right?

329
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,140
It's kind of eerie.

330
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,840
Really, I can't understand the feeling of somebody

331
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,140
who wants to come to a scary place like this.

332
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,840
Don't come then!

333
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,240
I can't help it!

334
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,740
I want the case to be solved as soon as possible,

335
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,440
and go to Tropical Land.

336
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,140
We were a bit concerned about the case, too.

337
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,440
Hey, hey.

338
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
You've got a huge family accompanying you today, don't you?

339
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,940
Hello.

340
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,140
And, did Genda confess?

341
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,440
His answer is an unchanging, "I don't know".

342
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,340
"I don't know"?

343
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,440
Yeah. According to him,

344
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,440
he says there's another him within himself,

345
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,040
and that guy may be going around setting fire.

346
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,540
He seems to have had the habit of sleepwalking since he was a child.

347
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,040
And that habit seems to have reoccurred recently,

348
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,540
so he's been seeing a doctor for treatment.

349
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,740
And don't tell me his doctor is...

350
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,140
Yeah, Akira Morozumi.

351
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,340
He seems to have prescribed a tranquilizer and gave it to Genda.

352
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,640
But he looked really surprised

353
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,840
at hearing that Genda was the arsonist.

354
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,940
Come to think of it, the man called Soga also looked surprised.

355
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,040
Soga and Genda used to see each other a lot

356
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,240
at the antique marketplace.

357
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,840
And Soga seems to be the one

358
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,940
who recommended Genda to go to Morozumi's hospital.

359
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,240
Misao Soga is an odd character who quit the medical university part way

360
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,340
and got absorbed in Feng Shui.

361
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,640
The reason why Genda was in that area that day

362
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,740
was because Soga had told him that if he goes to the houses there,

363
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,140
the direction is good, so he might find some luck.

364
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,240
Then, just as Heiji had said,

365
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,040
he had some connection with Mr. Genda.

366
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,840
Which means that Genda may have some connection

367
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,540
with the fortune-teller Keiko Gondo, too?

368
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,540
No, I haven't gone that far yet,

369
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,040
but that lady smells fishy.

370
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,740
When Ryoko was found,

371
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,640
I saw her gripping this small cushion really hard.

372
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,240
I had them all come this morning to headquarters

373
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,840
and asked them if this looked familiar to them,

374
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
but only that woman Gondo turned pale

375
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,940
and left in the wink of an eye.

376
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,240
Isn't that a dying message?

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,540
Why did you let her go?

378
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,140
The arsonist had already confessed,

379
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,040
and that lady already had an alibi

380
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,040
so we couldn't detain her.

381
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,240
Well, that's only if the time of the arson

382
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,340
is correct as you both insist.

383
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Well, would you like to confirm for yourself?

384
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,640
The one who testified is the boy next door.

385
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,340
Really! It's really true!

386
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,940
I saw it!

387
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,540
When the opening song of Kamen Yaiba started,

388
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,740
I saw a large shadow of a horse on the curtain of the living room!

389
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,640
Is it true, madam?

390
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I wonder...

391
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
because I entered the living room at 7:30 pm

392
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
and turned on the lights right away,

393
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,240
so I'm not sure if there was a shadow there or not.

394
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm not lying!

395
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,540
Will you show us that room?

396
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,040
It's this room.

397
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,040
If so...

398
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,340
the shadow of the horse was projected on this curtain.

399
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,140
True.

400
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,140
But, why was your son watching TV in a dark room?

401
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,440
It seems all the kids in this neighborhood do so now.

402
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,040
It's like watching a movie and really cool!

403
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,440
But sonny,

404
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,540
make sure you turn on the lights when you watch TV, okay?

405
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,840
Otherwise, our eyes will go bad really quickly.

406
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
Just like him?

407
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,140
Maybe the shadow of the horse

408
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,240
was already projected before 7:30 pm.

409
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,040
The shadow that is created by flames get light and dark

410
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,140
and sways a lot too,

411
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,640
so you can't tell if it's a horse or not at times.

412
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,740
That's not true!

413
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,140
Because I was watching baseball all the while

414
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,940
until the clock on top of the TV struck the time for Kamen Yaiba, but...

415
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,240
It got really bright outside the window,

416
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,740
and I saw the shadow.

417
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,840
It was time for the Kamen Yaiba song.

418
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,840
Then, were you watching the baseball game with the room dark, too?

419
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Yes.

420
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,340
But if it's dark, you can't see the time of the clock, right?

421
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,740
I could see it

422
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,340
because it was dimly light outside the window.

423
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,240
Besides, the shadow of the horse wasn't swaying.

424
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,340
Hey, Heiji!

425
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,940
Conan!

426
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Look really closely for it, Hattori.

427
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,540
I'm sure it's somewhere.

428
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,240
Yeah. The evidence that will prove our deduction

429
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,840
is here some place for sure.

430
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,140
I found it!

431
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,240
It's an incandescent electric light bulb.

432
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,040
I've found one here, too.

433
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,540
Here and there in burnt places,

434
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,640
there are burnt remains of tissue paper.

435
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
Which means that...

436
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,940
Yeah. If this trick is used,

437
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,840
you don't have to be here to set fire to the place.

438
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
All we need to find out now is

439
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
how the culprit manipulated Mr. Genda.

440
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,340
We've got to find proof of that.

441
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,820
"Key holder"

443
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,220
In the next episode, Hattori and I will have a hot deduction.

444
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,700
It's hot! My butt's on fire!

445
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,980
Hey, hey.
