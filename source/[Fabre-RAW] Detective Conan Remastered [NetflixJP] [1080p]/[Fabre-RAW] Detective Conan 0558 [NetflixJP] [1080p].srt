1
00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:06,816
Dr. Agasa and Haibara go to introduce Doc's invention.

2
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:09,716
On their way back, Doc's car breaks down

3
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:12,016
and what's more he loses his wallet

4
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:14,416
so he can't even get on the bus.

5
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,316
Fortunately, they got a lift from a car that happened to pass by.

6
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,616
But there were bullet holes inside

7
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:23,716
and traces of where blood had been wiped away.

8
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:27,216
There was also a gun in the glove compartment.

9
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,016
The people in the car tell them that they are headed for

10
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:32,011
the Mouri Detective Agency. Who are these people?

11
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,716
I hope they're not from the Black Organization.

12
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:37,816
After getting Haibara's call...

13
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:41,716
I headed toward the drive-in diner where the four of them were.

14
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:44,616
The suspicious twosome

15
00:00:44,616 --> 00:00:47,516
are Inspector Kansuke Yamato and Officer Yui Uehara

16
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:50,029
from the Nagano Prefectural Police Department.

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,516
Talk about worrying for nothing.

18
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:57,416
But what on earth did the two come here for?

19
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:00,616
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

20
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:03,216
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

21
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,416
A new character from Nagano, Inspector Koume.

22
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,316
Together we'll unravel the mystery of the Red Wall!

23
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,016
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,716
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:13,516
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:56,155
"Mouri Detective Agency"

27
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,294
And?

28
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,494
Did anything happen in Nagano?

29
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,294
You couldn't have come all the way out here

30
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,094
just to deliver us the Bota Mochi, right?

31
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:04,994
Oh, the fact is...

32
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:07,394
We can't solve it, you see...

33
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:09,394
So, we came to ask you for help.

34
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,171
We can't seem to solve

35
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:15,194
the mystery about the blood smeared "Red Wall."

36
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:21,894
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Three Favors)"

37
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:32,191
Isn't there a better road to drive on?

38
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:35,094
After all, I, Kogoro Mouri, the famed detective

39
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:39,694
has come to offer you a hand immediately

40
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:42,894
regarding the murder case, don't you think?

41
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:46,205
Thanks to you, I didn't get to eat the Bota Mochi either.

42
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:47,994
I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,794
This road is the shortcut.

44
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:52,694
And? Isn't it about time you tell us

45
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:55,994
about the mystery of the blood smeared red wall?

46
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,794
Don't tell me that there's a place somewhere in the forest

47
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,794
where the walls are painted red with human blood?

48
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,221
No.

49
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,094
Although Kan-chan says that that it is smeared with blood,

50
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:08,227
-he actually means... -Hey, stop right there.

51
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,694
Kan-chan.

52
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:13,094
Preconceptions get in the way of deduction.

53
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:15,194
We went all the way out to Tokyo to pick you up

54
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:18,494
so that you could come to the site and look it over immediately!

55
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,241
And Uehara!

56
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,694
I'm your boss!

57
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:26,245
Don't call me Kan-chan.

58
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:30,249
Yes, Inspector Kansuke Yamato!

59
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:35,094
Well, I guess you can at least tell us where we're headed, though.

60
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:38,257
To an old house that is built beyond inside this forest

61
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,194
called the House of Hope.

62
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:44,994
House of Hope, what a nice name.

63
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:49,894
It was called by that name 20 years ago.

64
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:53,694
Right. Three years ago, a woman,

65
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,894
who had died a pitiful death

66
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,277
was found in the warehouse of that house.

67
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:02,281
And since then, I hear that the locals refer to it as...

68
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,283
not the House of Hope.

69
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,594
But, rather, the House of Death.

70
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:12,094
House of Death.

71
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:20,794
Although it's pretty old, it's a fine house.

72
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:25,194
It seems to have been the villa of some rich person originally.

73
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:26,305
Hey.

74
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,309
Isn't it sort of strange that Inspector Yamato

75
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,494
would ask Pops to help him with a case?

76
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:38,317
Oh, that's because someone that he doesn't want to admit defeat to

77
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,194
is involved in this case!

78
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,594
Which means that

79
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,694
the person he doesn't want to admit defeat to is from the police?

80
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:45,894
Yes.

81
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:50,329
But that person is not from the Nagano Prefectural Police Headquarters,

82
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,994
he is rather an officer whose jurisdiction is in this area,

83
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,494
an officer from the local Arano Police Department.

84
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:57,794
But if that officer's from the station with jurisdiction over this area,

85
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:01,094
why would an officer from the headquarters want to do him in?

86
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,894
That person is actually

87
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:06,094
Kan-chan's classmate since elementary school

88
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:09,594
and seems to be competing with Kan-chan about everything!

89
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:14,094
He graduated Tohto University's School of Law with as a top graduate

90
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:15,694
but didn't take the career test for what he specialized in.

91
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:19,294
He rather, entered the headquarters as a non-career worker.

92
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:21,594
He is a slightly queer man who got transferred

93
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:23,694
to the Arano Police Department after a certain incident.

94
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:26,894
Which means they were originally colleagues

95
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,294
-at the Nagano Prefectural Police Department? -Right!

96
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:32,794
And this person's also got a militaristic name like Kan-chan!

97
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,894
Hey, Uehara!

98
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,375
We're going in!

99
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,694
Oh, yes, sir!

100
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:42,381
Come to think of it. The name Kansuke Yamato

101
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,994
is so much like the name of Shingen Takeda's strategist,

102
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,385
Kansuke Yamamoto.

103
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,994
Anyway,

104
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:49,994
anytime this person competes with him,

105
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,594
Kan-chan seems to get upset

106
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,994
and since he's never experience victory yet,

107
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:55,794
please help him out, okay?

108
00:06:56,694 --> 00:07:00,694
It seems that Kan-chan's really not counting on Detective Mouri,

109
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:03,594
but, rather, you!

110
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:12,094
I'll tell you why this place was called the House of Hope.

111
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:14,794
A rich man who built this house,

112
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:18,694
after the house got old and he stopped using it,

113
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:20,194
decided to let talented young people

114
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:21,994
who didn't have money stay here

115
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:26,425
for rent that was almost like free,

116
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,194
until they realized their dreams!

117
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:34,433
Well, and that kindly rich man who used to come visit this house sometimes,

118
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:39,294
soon after finishing procedures to hand this house over to the inhabitants

119
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:40,694
died of an illness.

120
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,094
The people who lived here

121
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:46,445
went independent two or three years later and left the house too.

122
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:47,994
And since five or six years ago,

123
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,994
only a couple who met and got married at this house

124
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:53,094
seems to have been living here.

125
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,794
Hey, Uehara.

126
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:57,794
Show them the pictures of the people who used to live here!

127
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,994
Yes, sir!

128
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,494
Here are the six of them.

129
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:11,194
The topmost picture is Illustrator, Mr. Shusaku Akashi.

130
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:15,694
The next one is, Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, an actor.

131
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:20,094
The next is novelist, Ms. Aoi Kobashi.

132
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:24,494
Fashion designer, Mr. Shoji Yamabuki.

133
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:28,894
CG creator, Mr. Takuto Momose.

134
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:32,794
And lastly, musician Mr. Shiro Naoki.

135
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:40,194
The names are all ones that sound familiar and yet not.

136
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:41,694
By the way,

137
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,503
something's been bothering me from a while ago but...

138
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:47,394
What is this?

139
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,594
There's what looks to be the mark of colored paper

140
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,511
torn off from the door of the room.

141
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,494
Come to think of it,

142
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:56,294
there's a similar mark on the door of this room too.

143
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:58,517
That's probably...

144
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:00,519
Maybe they were marked by colored paper to tell them apart?

145
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,994
Colored paper?

146
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:07,494
I think that the people used the colored paper to tell the rooms apart!

147
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:10,529
Because all six people have colors in their names!

148
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,794
Stupid!

149
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:13,894
The names are pasted onto the pictures

150
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,994
but none of them have characters that mean color.

151
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:18,094
It's not the character, but sound of the name!

152
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,494
I get it!

153
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:22,894
Mr. Akashi is Red!

154
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:26,545
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa is Green!

155
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,547
Exactly.

156
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,549
Ms. Aoi Kobashi is Blue!

157
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,494
Mr. Shoji Yamabuki is Golden Yellow!

158
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,555
Mr. Takuto Momose is Peach color!

159
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,494
Mr. Shiro Naoki, the color White.

160
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:42,561
See, all six people have colors in their names!

161
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,994
Amazing, Conan!

162
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:48,567
Not only the rooms, but those six

163
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:53,394
seem to have categorized themselves by color for almost everything.

164
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,573
Look!

165
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,575
This came out of the warehouse of this house.

166
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,894
It's an old mealtime chore schedule!

167
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:03,494
Their names aren't listed but rather, only color.

168
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:09,594
It could be that they were all calling themselves by color.

169
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:11,194
And?

170
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,994
Where's the room where the corpse was found?

171
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,294
This way.

172
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,394
What are those cardboard boxes that are stacked up on that cart?

173
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:28,594
There are books inside and it's packed full.

174
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,594
It's really heavy too.

175
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,294
The door of this room that swings outwards

176
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:35,294
was blocked by this cart.

177
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,394
So that the person inside

178
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:40,619
couldn't come out until he died.

179
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,894
So, that room is the one in question...

180
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,194
Yeah.

181
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,294
When we got here,

182
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:51,194
he was already skinny and starved to death.

183
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:54,294
In this horrible...

184
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:57,494
room with red walls.

185
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:01,494
Don't tell me that this is...

186
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,641
Human blood?

187
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,494
-It's lacquer. -What?

188
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:10,094
See, the mouth of this lacquer paint spray can on the floor.

189
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:13,194
It's got the same color on it as the one on the wall!

190
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:18,294
But what's with this black and white chair?

191
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:19,894
Paint seems to have deliberately been put on it

192
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:22,661
and nailed to the floor to fix it in place.

193
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:26,294
The corpse was sitting on the white chair.

194
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,094
Don't tell me that

195
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,994
it's a message from the killer addressed to somebody?

196
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:33,594
No, that can't be.

197
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:38,294
In this room. The wiretap is still intact.

198
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,394
Wiretap?

199
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:42,681
I see.

200
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:44,683
The killer, wiretapped this room

201
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,694
and was confirming whether the victim was dead or alive.

202
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:51,094
And came to this room after no noise was heard at all

203
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,294
to confirm whether the victim had really died.

204
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:56,695
The wiretap would've been retrieved.

205
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,494
But since it's still here...

206
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:02,394
Yeah. The killer left the victim locked in here

207
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:04,703
and never came here.

208
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:10,494
In other words, the red wall and black and white chair are without doubt...

209
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:15,094
what the victim left behind as a dying message!

210
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:31,363
How about it? Did you figure it out?

211
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:34,733
It's so easy there's nothing to figure out. The message is red!

212
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:39,263
In other words, the color red is in the name.

213
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,863
Akashi, I think?

214
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:43,763
I hate to say this,

215
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,745
but the one who was found starved in this room

216
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:50,163
was that man, Shusaku Akashi!

217
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:56,763
By the way, Aoi Kobashi who was married to Shusaku Akashi

218
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,263
had the surname Akashi too but...

219
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,063
She died three years ago in the warehouse here.

220
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:06,563
Don't tell me that the person called Aoi was also killed?

221
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:10,263
No, she had a bad heart condition to begin with.

222
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:13,863
She had an attack while looking for something in the warehouse,

223
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:15,263
and died.

224
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,763
Her husband was in this room

225
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,263
creating a piece of work at that time.

226
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:24,163
It seems that he only realized that she was lying dead

227
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:26,785
after half a day had passed.

228
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,363
Oh no.

229
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:33,263
If so, it's not the color red in this name.

230
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:36,795
Red. Red hot...

231
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,063
I see!

232
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,799
Red hot story, maybe?

233
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,663
I didn't go all the way to Tokyo

234
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:46,263
to pick you up to hear something like that from you!

235
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:48,807
Attempting to meet a worthy man

236
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,763
without taking the proper course

237
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:54,813
is as if inviting him to come

238
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:58,263
yet barring the gate against him.

239
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,863
I see.

240
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:03,263
You didn't call the renowned detective by phone and summon him

241
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,825
but rather, went to pick him up. Up to there, it's acceptable.

242
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:11,263
But, what you just said to Detective Mouri

243
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:13,663
is utterly rude.

244
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:19,463
As an old friend of yours, I'm ashamed, Kansuke.

245
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,463
Why the heck are you here?

246
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:23,463
Local police stay out of this, you!

247
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:27,363
No, this is the jurisdiction of the Arano Police Department.

248
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:29,763
I can't possibly stay out of this.

249
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:31,463
Stop your far-fetched argument!

250
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,563
-Just plain logic. -What was that

251
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:37,263
about being relieved being covered with hair?

252
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:39,863
It's not covered with hair.

253
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,463
Those are the words of Gentoku Ryubei

254
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:45,963
who appears in the story of the Three Kingdoms who went out of his way

255
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:49,333
to pick up a wise strategist to invite him over!

256
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,869
Attempting to meet a worthy man

257
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,871
without taking the proper course

258
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,537
is as if inviting him to come

259
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,237
yet barring the gate against him.

260
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:58,877
In other words,

261
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:03,837
doing something improper as to summon a great wise man,

262
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,337
is like closing the gate to the wise man

263
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,437
despite asking him to come. This is what it means!

264
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:13,357
So, saying, Ryubei visited that man three times!

265
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:16,895
You knew nothing about Fuurinkazan,

266
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,663
and yet why do you know so much about the Three Kingdoms?

267
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,163
Who cares.

268
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:23,763
Anyway,

269
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:26,563
the unsolved mystery left in this room

270
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:31,663
are not only this red walls and the black and white chair.

271
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:35,263
That paneled boarded window has been cracked from inside.

272
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:38,663
And from that hole that had been opened, paint and lacquer,

273
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:42,063
anything that is used to paint color has all been thrown out.

274
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:44,463
The only thing left in this room

275
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:48,263
was this red colored spray

276
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:51,363
and the signature of the victim,

277
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:53,963
who bit off his own finger to write it

278
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:57,263
at the edge of the red colored wall.

279
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:00,463
Taking all these things into consideration, it is only proper

280
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,563
to ask the renowned detective once again of what he thinks.

281
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:08,163
Ryubei. Strategist. Three times?

282
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,951
Of course I will stand witness here.

283
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,953
After all, the fact that I thought that

284
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,663
there was something strange

285
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,957
about the large amount of paint that was scattered outside the house

286
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,963
was what lead to the discovery of the corpse.

287
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,563
Hey, don't tell me that the strategist is the famous...

288
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,967
Yes, the one who is always holding the feather fan.

289
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,663
You maybe from the prefectural headquarters,

290
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:34,973
but you can't possibly keep me out of this.

291
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,363
If I remember correctly, his name is...

292
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,963
Okay, I got it!

293
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,981
Stay as close as you want to your heart's content!

294
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:44,983
Shokatsuryo...

295
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:48,763
-Koume! -Koume?

296
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,993
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,563
My name is Takaaki Morofushi.

298
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:02,463
But, my nickname is read, Koume.

299
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,963
So, please call me that way from now on.

300
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,263
I see.

301
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:11,009
Instead of Koume Shokatsuryo...

302
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,663
He's local (Shokatsu) officer Koume.

303
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:23,021
And, how about it, Sleeping Kogoro?

304
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,363
This wall that is sprayed red with paint.

305
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:31,029
The signature that the victim wrote in blood on the edge of the wall!

306
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,363
The paneled window is cracked,

307
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:37,035
and from that hole painting tools are thrown out the window!

308
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,963
And, these two chairs painted black and white

309
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:43,863
that are nailed in place to the floor!

310
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,363
A guy that was confined to a room like this and starved to death.

311
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:52,063
Do you know what this man was trying to relay?

312
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:54,663
Do I know?

313
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,763
Even with the intelligence of a famous detective,

314
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,463
this mystery I see is difficult to solve.

315
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:03,061
Red, white and black.

316
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:08,163
He wanted to relay something using these three colors, right?

317
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:12,063
Because all the other colors were thrown out of the window.

318
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,863
Oh, who is this boy?

319
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:18,763
He's a kid that's staying with Sleeping Kogoro,

320
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:21,563
whose name is Conan Edogawa.

321
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,081
Conan Edogawa.

322
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,563
And...

323
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,363
The cardboard boxes that were stacked on the cart

324
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:31,563
that was blocking the door of the room from opening.

325
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:33,863
There seems to have been books inside them,

326
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,563
but whose books were they?

327
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,663
Aoi's books!

328
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,863
Like I just mentioned.

329
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,163
She's the wife of Mr. Shusaku Akashi

330
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,763
who was found starved to death in this room,

331
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:48,263
and the one who was found dead in the warehouse here of an illness,

332
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:50,663
maiden name, Ms. Aoi Kobashi.

333
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:54,563
A large amount of books from the bookshelf in her room were removed,

334
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:57,763
and were packed in those cardboard boxes.

335
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:01,119
She had a lot of books.

336
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,863
And, she herself was also a novelist.

337
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:07,563
Then, it could've been the doing of one of Aoi's family members

338
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,763
who wanted to avenge her death.

339
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:13,463
Because despite Aoi collapsing of a heart attack,

340
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:15,133
Shusaku kept on drawing

341
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,063
and didn't realize what had happened until half a day later.

342
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:20,563
But, what family member...

343
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,463
She was an only child,

344
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:24,763
and her parents had died when she was still young.

345
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:29,147
Then, maybe the four men who used to live here

346
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:32,063
with her in the past are to be suspected?

347
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:34,163
Huh? Why?

348
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:37,963
Because unless the culprit knew that there were many books in Aoi's room

349
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:41,163
as well as the fact that the door swings open outwardly,

350
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:43,563
the culprint wouldn't think of

351
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:47,163
placing a cart filled with books to block the door.

352
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:49,167
In other words, it is highly likely that

353
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,663
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa the actor,

354
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:54,963
Mr. Shoji Yamabuki, the fashion designer.

355
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:58,063
CG creator Mr. Takuto Momose

356
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,163
or the musician Mr. Shiro Naoki

357
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:04,163
is the culprit.

358
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,563
That's the picture, right? Pops!

359
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:13,763
Yeah.

360
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:21,199
I see. You see things more or less as we do until here.

361
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:25,203
But, you deliberately didn't remark on it

362
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:27,463
because you figured that such a simple deduction

363
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,763
-was not even worth mentioning? -Yes.

364
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,963
What? Are you serious?

365
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:38,363
Yeah, okay, I'll go check things out for myself then!

366
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,063
What's the matter, Kan-chan?

367
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,963
I mean, Inspector Yamato.

368
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,963
What's the matter, my foot!

369
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,463
I was lead to believe that the fingerprints found on the door knob

370
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,463
on the inside of the room

371
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:51,663
and the prints on the red spray

372
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:55,663
were that of the victim, Mr. Akashi but...

373
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,763
The prints found were actually yours, Koume

374
00:20:57,763 --> 00:21:03,241
and that of your fellow police officer!

375
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:09,247
I'm going to call that officer over to headquarters right now

376
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,263
and squeeze info out of him, but...

377
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:15,253
Well, I wish you wouldn't get to hard on him.

378
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:18,563
After all, he's still a green-horn officer,

379
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:21,763
I'm sure he got upset over seeing his first dead body

380
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,663
at the scene experience,

381
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:26,063
and inadvertently touched something.

382
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:31,063
So, you and the green-horn officer found the corpse together?

383
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:35,763
Yes. I asked him to come to this house in the car on our way back

384
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:40,463
from another incident we going around asking questions about.

385
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:42,663
Because I wanted to offer flowers

386
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:45,283
and place them in front of the warehouse here.

387
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,963
Flowers?

388
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:50,063
Oh, I forgot to mention it,

389
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:53,063
but Inspector Morofushi and Inspector Yamato

390
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:57,295
were classmates with Aoi who died in this warehouse three years ago.

391
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,763
-Class... -Classmates?

392
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:03,301
Inspector Morofushi was classmates with Ms. Aoi Kobashi

393
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,763
who passed away in the warehouse of this house three years ago?

394
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:09,307
Is it just a coincidence that the same inspector turns out

395
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:13,663
to be the one to first discover the corpse of Mr. Shusaku Akashi?

396
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:17,963
The dying message that Mr. Akashi left behind.

397
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,319
The walls that were painted red with lacquer spray

398
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,263
and the two chairs painted black and white that are nailed to the floor.

399
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,963
What did Mr. Akashi want to relay using all this?

400
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:31,863
The mystery of the red wall.

401
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:35,663
The culprit who starved Mr. Akashi to death.

402
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:38,863
I'm going to get him no matter what!

403
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,118
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:05,423
"Chess"

405
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,460
They've come all the way from Nagano in want of my deduction.

406
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,740
He's really a happy-go-lucky man.
