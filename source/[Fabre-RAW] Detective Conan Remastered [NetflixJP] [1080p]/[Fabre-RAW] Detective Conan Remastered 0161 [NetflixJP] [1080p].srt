1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,960
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,560
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,160
Today's setting is an unusual restaurant,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,160
the crime arrives by water.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,760
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,060
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,280
"Murder at Ryusuitei"

9
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,320
"Ryusuitei"

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Gosh. We are 30 minutes early for our reservation.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,300
This is a very popular place.

12
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,300
If we are late, they will cancel our reservation.

13
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,300
I'm tired of waiting and I'm getting hungry.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
All right, Room 4's sake is ready!

15
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Got it!

16
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Okay!

17
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,200
I see. A restaurant where the food is served by boat.

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
No wonder it's popular.

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,100
Do you like it?

20
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,900
There are bigger boats too.

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,400
What happens to the boat once it gets to the room?

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
The customer takes the dishes off the boat

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
then pushes a button in the room

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,300
and it goes back automatically.

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
Wow, that's neat!

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,700
Excuse me.

27
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,700
-Yes? -We have reservations.

28
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,500
Mr. Kaneda, you reserved Room 8, didn't you?

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,900
Huh?

30
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,400
Hey, Kaneda.

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Not me. There must be a mistake.

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Hey, Kaneda, Arai!

33
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
You're late. I was getting tired of waiting.

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Sorry. Kaneda was late.

35
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,800
Go on, apologize.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
This wasn't my idea.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Come on! This is to celebrate your promotion to assistant professor,

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,200
the Professor's treat!

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Just because we were hired the same time

40
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
doesn't mean we're friends.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Starting today, address me as Assistant Professor Kaneda.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Understand?

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,100
And you're my assistant, Arai.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,300
Out of my way.

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Hey, you. What's the most expensive dish you have?

46
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,100
It's blowfish milt.

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,200
Then bring us three of those.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
You don't mind, do you, Professor?

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,700
No, it's fine with me.

50
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,500
Tonight is your night.

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,600
We'll have three orders of blowfish milt.

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
Yes, right away.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Let's go inside.

54
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Did you see that? That Kaneda's a real stinker!

55
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,600
I wonder why Professor Iwama always orders so much food?

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Maybe he likes a full table.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,400
But he usually leaves without eating much.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm dying of hunger!

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Those men are next door.

60
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,000
Here it comes!

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,900
What a huge boat!

62
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,700
Look at all the food! I won't be able to...

63
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,800
Huh?

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Gosh, it wasn't ours.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Professor, there sure is a lot of food, isn't there?

66
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,400
It's a celebration.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,000
By the way, I wonder where Kaneda went off to.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,900
He probably went to the toilet. He'll be back soon.

69
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,800
"Room 2"

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Delicious!

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
Conan, how's the sashimi?

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Yes.

73
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,200
Hey, where'd it go?

74
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,100
I dropped my contact lens!

75
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
Oh no, now I've done it!

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,600
Here. I found it! What a relief!

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
For a professor, he's quite a scatterbrain.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Boy, that was the best!

79
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,300
If there were geishas here, it'd be heaven!

80
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Dad!

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,400
Hey, hey. There's a child present.

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,700
I was kidding. It's a joke.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,900
Huh?

84
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,200
Hey, Ran. We're out of sake.

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Order me another.

86
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
One bottle is enough.

87
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
We're going to have a delicious dinner now.

88
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,500
Gosh. It's not just her personality,

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,300
now she's even beginning to sound like her mother Eri.

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,500
What?

91
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Somebody come quick!

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,400
What's going on?

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
What happened?

94
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,300
The customer is...

95
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,100
That's...

96
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,800
Ka... Kaneda!

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
He's dead.

98
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,800
This is a murder.

99
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
Notify the police immediately.

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Yes!

101
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,500
Professor Iwama, what happened?

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,100
Kaneda is dead in this room!

103
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,700
What?

104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Listen! A murder has just taken place!

105
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
Until the police arrive,

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,700
I want everyone to wait in their rooms!

107
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,200
The police will probably want to question everyone.

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Your cooperation will be appreciated.

109
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,800
Since he fell at this angle,

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
I guess Mr. Kaneda, who was sitting at the far end of the table,

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,700
greeted the killer

112
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,300
and was stabbed in the chest while facing him.

113
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,100
Then he fell onto the table.

114
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,800
If the killer came here by the waterway,

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,500
this room should be sopping wet

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,200
but it's not.

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
What is this black thing on his thumb?

118
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,600
This smell is...

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,000
How many times do I have to tell you

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,100
not to wander around the crime scene!

121
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
The victim is Keizo Kaneda,

122
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,100
assistant professor of science at Jomon University, 29 years of age.

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,400
He was stabbed in the heart with a dagger and died instantly.

124
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Time of death is estimated to be at about 19:50.

125
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Also, we have confirmed the alibis of all the restaurant employees.

126
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,400
This is Professor Iwama and Mr. Arai is an instructor,

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,100
both men work with the victim at the university.

128
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,200
We were celebrating Kaneda's promotion

129
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
to assistant professor tonight.

130
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,600
I thought he was in the toilet.

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,100
Who would've thought something like this was possible?

132
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,200
And a certain party just happened to be on the scene.

133
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,500
Yes! The famous private detective Kogoro Mouri here!

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,900
Inspector Megure!

135
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,100
And Kyoko Anzai, you were the first to discover the body.

136
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,300
Yes. The customer went into the room

137
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,900
but never placed an order,

138
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,000
so I went in to check on him. That's how I found him.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
But why was he in Room 8?

140
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Didnt he say he didn't make that reservation?

141
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,400
That's why I called out to him

142
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
when he started to head for that room.

143
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,200
But he said he was meeting someone there.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
So he was meeting someone secretly.

145
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,700
That person must have killed him.

146
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,100
Did you see anyone besides the victim enter the room?

147
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,600
No, no one.

148
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
You're positive?

149
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Yes. I was standing at the register

150
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,500
and looking out at the garden.

151
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,200
The front door is the only way to get in

152
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
and everyone has to cross the bridge to get to their rooms.

153
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Then how did the killer get into the room?

154
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,900
Inspector, from the waterway.

155
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,200
It was designed to go past each room,

156
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,600
so you can get to the room by using it.

157
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,800
I see. So you're saying this is an inside job.

158
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
All right, Takagi.

159
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,500
Ask all the customers if they saw someone using the waterway.

160
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Yes, sir!

161
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,700
"Room 4"

162
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,000
We were looking at the waterway a lot

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,400
but we didn't see anyone on it.

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
"Room 5"

165
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
No, no one like that.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
I didn't see anyone either.

167
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
"Room 6"

168
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,700
-No idea. -No one went by.

169
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,300
"Room 7"

170
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,800
If someone was walking in the water, we'd notice.

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,900
Only boats went by.

172
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,500
No one saw anything?

173
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,600
No. All the other rooms were parties of four or more

174
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
but no one saw anything other than boats go past.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,100
Maybe the killer went underwater?

176
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,000
No. The water's only about 50 centimeters deep,

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
it's not possible to swim underwater.

178
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Besides, if the killer went underwater,

179
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,500
the room would be sopping wet.

180
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Did you say something?

181
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,100
No, I was talking to myself.

182
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,500
Either way, since coming in from the outside is impossible,

183
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
it must be an inside job.

184
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,400
We've got to confirm everyone's alibi.

185
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,300
Mr. Iwama, where were you at about 7:50?

186
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,200
I never left our room, Room 3.

187
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,300
Isn't that about the time you were shouting?

188
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes, that's right.

189
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
While I was looking for my contact lens,

190
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,100
I knocked some dishes over.

191
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,900
After that, I saw the screen close in your room,

192
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,500
so your alibi is okay.

193
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,600
Mr. Arai, you came back to the restaurant after the murder.

194
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
After Kaneda left,

195
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,400
the professor asked me to buy him a pack of cigarettes

196
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,900
so I went to the convenience store.

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,900
I told him where to go.

198
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,300
We didn't have the brand he wanted at our register.

199
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,900
It took me about 10 minutes to walk there.

200
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,600
I have a receipt.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,600
The time on the receipt is 19:52.

202
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Which means these two men have perfect alibis.

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,000
The killer must be one of the other customers.

204
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,900
No. With the other parties of four or more,

205
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
the killer would have to fool the others

206
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,700
as well as Mr. Anzai to get to that room, so it's impossible.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,400
These two are the only ones who were able to be alone

208
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
and commit the crime.

209
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Takagi. Let's split up and verify the other customers' alibis.

210
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,300
Yes, sir!

211
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Madam, I want to see the boats.

212
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,900
Not now, Conan. It's a bad time.

213
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,000
It's all right. I have nothing to do now.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,400
Thank you so much.

215
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,700
See, this is it.

216
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,200
Is the door always locked?

217
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,500
Yes, that's right.

218
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,900
We don't want just anyone going in and out of here.

219
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,100
I'm the only employee with a key.

220
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,600
Here we are, go on.

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,100
Five boats altogether

222
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
and one of them is huge.

223
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,400
This is the same stuff that was on Mr. Kaneda's finger.

224
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,100
But he wasn't there when the food got to their room.

225
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,400
Was the whiskey and ice on this boat just now?

226
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Yes. The reservation specifically stated this boat was to be used,

227
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,600
the food was to be served at 7:30 and the drinks at 8:00.

228
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,400
A small motor and sensor...

229
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,500
There's a lot of space inside.

230
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,300
So all that's left is the alibi.

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
Thank you very much.

232
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,600
There's one wrapper missing.

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,300
This is...

234
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,100
I see.

235
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,500
So that's why that person did that.

236
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,700
I found it.

237
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,000
A tiny hole and a wet spot.

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,300
That person's alibi has just been cracked.

239
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
On top of that, I've got undeniable evidence.

240
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,290
Pops, may I talk to you?

241
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,690
Go away! You're bothering me!

242
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,090
I found something really weird.

243
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,790
Something weird?

244
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,690
What? I can't hear you.

245
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,590
Inspector, all the customers in Room 7 have alibis.

246
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,890
Excuse me. How much longer do we have to stay?

247
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,690
Yes, you're right. I suppose you two can go.

248
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,990
Not yet! It's too early.

249
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,290
What?

250
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,290
The truth is, I know how the killer got to the room.

251
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,390
You do? Why don't you explain?

252
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,290
We were right the killer did use the waterway.

253
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,190
-Come on. -Listen, Mr. Mouri.

254
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,990
All the witnesses agree there were only boats on the waterway.

255
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,590
That's right. The killer used a boat.

256
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,990
A boat?

257
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,990
A small person could hide in the big boat.

258
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,290
There's enough room.

259
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,790
First, the killer requests

260
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,090
that the larger boat be used to serve their complete meal.

261
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,190
He takes the food off and removes the clapboard

262
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,490
then he gets in.

263
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,390
The boat returns to its berth by sensor.

264
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,090
Before it gets there,

265
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,390
he turns the sensor off using his foot.

266
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,990
The boat's motor goes off

267
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,690
and it reaches Room 8.

268
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,990
Kaneda must have been really surprised at first.

269
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,690
But he wasn't worried after all.

270
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,890
He would never suspect a friend would come to kill him.

271
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,490
The killer used this element of surprise...

272
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,890
and killed him.

273
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,690
So no one would think he came in through the waterway,

274
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,090
the killer made Mr. Kaneda face the doorway.

275
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,890
I see.

276
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,090
But then, how did the killer get back into his own room?

277
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,890
It's simple.

278
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,690
He got back into the boat

279
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,190
and turned the sensor back on,

280
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,090
the boat will automatically go back to the dock.

281
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,490
All he needs to do now is wait.

282
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,990
As directed,

283
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,490
the boat would carry their drinks to the room at 8:00.

284
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,490
But unfortunately for the killer,

285
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,190
I noticed something.

286
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,290
What was that?

287
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,890
The waterline.

288
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,990
There was only that whiskey set on the boat,

289
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,890
yet the waterline was extremely high.

290
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,190
What it proves is that the killer had been in the boat.

291
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,990
Wait a minute!

292
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,390
The only one who could have remained in the room alone

293
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,290
and who was a friend is...

294
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,890
Yes. The murderer is Professor Iwama!

295
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,090
It could only have been you.

296
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,990
What?

297
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,690
Professor...

298
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,990
You probably told him

299
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,890
you wanted to speak to him in private in another room

300
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,890
and had him reserve Room 8.

301
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,890
And when the food arrived,

302
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,290
you sent Mr. Arai out to buy your cigarettes.

303
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,690
Deliberately asking for a brand they don't sell at the register

304
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,790
so he'd have to go to a convenience store.

305
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,790
Hold it right there, Mr. Mouri!

306
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,090
You yourself testified that

307
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,790
I was in my room at the time of the crime!

308
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,890
With that alibi, how could I have killed Kaneda?

309
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,690
You have a tape recorder, don't you?

310
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,990
Of course I do.

311
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,690
It's a small one I carry around in my bag for meetings.

312
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,090
Even if I could use it to tape voices and sounds,

313
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,290
how would I close the sliding door?

314
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,490
How about by using a rubber band, a pin,

315
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,890
a chopstick wrapper and ice?

316
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,090
First, you use the pin to hold the rubber band in place

317
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,090
to the sliding door and it's frame.

318
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,690
Then you stuff the chopstick wrapper

319
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,090
into the sliding door on the other side

320
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,690
and tack one end down.

321
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,490
Then you pull the door with the rubber band

322
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,790
attached to the chopstick wrapper

323
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,590
and pin it through the chopstick wrapper.

324
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,090
The finishing touch, you took ice from the food

325
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,790
and put it on the wrapper circle.

326
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,190
The ice will melt making the paper wrapper soft

327
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,590
and when it breaks...

328
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,090
the rubber band will snap back closing the door.

329
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,490
I see.

330
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,990
When you returned to the room, Mr. Iwama,

331
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,890
you got rid of the rubber band and tacks and erased the tape.

332
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,890
And if you threw the wrapper into the waterway,

333
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,290
there'd be no evidence left.

334
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,190
That's right. There's no evidence.

335
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,790
If you're accusing me of killing Kaneda,

336
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,290
show me the proof show me! Show me!

337
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,690
Mr. Arai.

338
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,690
When you took the food off the boat

339
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,290
did you spill the sauce for the blowfish milt?

340
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,290
Yes, I did.

341
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,390
I spill it on the clapboard.

342
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,890
Mr. Iwama.

343
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,690
When Miss Anzai screamed and you came out of the room,

344
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,090
you had your jacket on, didn't you?

345
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,290
No one would bother to put their jacket on in an emergency.

346
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,990
But you did because the sauce got on your shirt

347
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,690
when you got into the boat, isn't that right?

348
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,390
Mr. Iwama. Will you remove your jacket?

349
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,690
I do have a sauce stain on it.

350
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,290
But I got it when I spilled the sauce

351
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,090
while I was looking for my contact lens.

352
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,890
I wonder.

353
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,390
Mr. Kaneda left the room before the food arrived

354
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,590
but he had some sauce on his thumb.

355
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,190
What?

356
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,190
I wonder when he got it?

357
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,090
It... it can't be...

358
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,190
That's right.

359
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,490
When you stabbed him, he grabbed you there.

360
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,390
Right on that stain on your shirt.

361
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,690
Consequently, Mr. Kaneda's fingerprint is on your shirt.

362
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,490
Kaneda heard that in the past,

363
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,790
I had put my name on a student's thesis paper

364
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,390
and passed it off as my own.

365
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,190
He threatened to make it public

366
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,490
if I didn't recommend him

367
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,090
for the assistant professor's position to the selection committee.

368
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,890
On top of that, he wanted me to give him 5 million yen.

369
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,690
I couldn't put up with it anymore!

370
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,990
The blowfish milt was an unexpected order.

371
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,490
If he hadn't ordered it, I would have gotten away.

372
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,290
"Mouri Detective Agency"

373
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,290
Remenber "Ryusuitei"?

374
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,690
Since the murder, they've gotten popular again.

375
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,490
Hey, dad. Take us there again.

376
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,190
Sure, as long as there are geishas there.

377
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,090
How about if I serve you then?

378
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,490
No, no thank you!

379
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,890
Scary.
