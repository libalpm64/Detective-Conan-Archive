1
00:00:02,243 --> 00:00:04,943
Thief Kid who is after the big jewel, "Giraffe horns",

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:08,943
sends a letter of warning that he will be stealing it.

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,343
The giraffe horns cannot be taken out

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,643
unless the trick that Kichiemon Samizu had built

5
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:13,993
is undone by inserting the four keys

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,143
of the four pedestals into the keyholes at the same time

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,043
and turning them at the same time as well.

8
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,443
We, the members of the Detective Squad,

9
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:24,943
were appointed to guard the four pedestals.

10
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,007
But Conan was knocked out in the dark,

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:32,011
and the giraffe horns had suddenly vanished.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,943
The four pedestals each represented the four legendary gods,

13
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:37,043
the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,

14
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:40,843
Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon.

15
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:44,643
Maybe the words of Kichiemon Samizu that are carved on the pillar

16
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:48,643
where the giraffe horns are stored have something to do with this.

17
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:54,843
I guess we'll have to solve this mystery on our own!

18
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,643
Brooding over passing seasons

19
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,643
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

20
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:21,343
Thief Kid who is confined

21
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:23,543
disguises himself as that guy?

22
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,243
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:27,043
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,143
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:59,102
"Thief Kid vs. Four Gods Detective Squad"

26
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:02,161
What? You want to confirm

27
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,002
the sounds and images at the time of the black-out?

28
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,202
I want to make sure and see that

29
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:08,602
there are no strange sounds or images.

30
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,702
That's true.

31
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:13,502
Because in order to turn the keys of the four pedestals

32
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,502
in the dark at the same time,

33
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:18,602
some kind of signal would be necessary.

34
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:21,202
Let's check with the VTR!

35
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,502
Black-out?

36
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:27,802
Don't panic! It was to be expected.

37
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,202
It's the sound of the shutter breaking,

38
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:34,193
and the wind and rain blowing inside the room.

39
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:37,902
I was so surprised I put on my hood.

40
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:41,202
-Me, too! -Same here.

41
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:43,902
Be quiet!

42
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:45,902
Okay.

43
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:48,702
-It's our voices. -Yeah.

44
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,502
Right.

45
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,702
This is the sound of the electricity

46
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,702
that is flowing through the pedestals being cut off, right?

47
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:03,202
-It can't be? -This is the sound of the pillar

48
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,602
in the center rising and the giraffe statue coming out.

49
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,702
So this is the light of the stun gun...

50
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,231
Conan!

51
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,902
The light turned on.

52
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:15,902
I turned it on

53
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:19,002
because I was worried at hearing Conan's scream.

54
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:21,402
It's after this.

55
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:25,502
The giraffe horns are gone!

56
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:29,502
It seems that the giraffe horns were already stolen at this point.

57
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,251
They're on!

58
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,802
So, there were no strange sounds or lights after all.

59
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:41,502
No. To be precise, nothing was unexpected

60
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:43,002
other than the flash of light from the stun gun

61
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:46,602
when this little glasses boy was attacked and his scream.

62
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:51,902
The sound of the pillar moving was heard before the boy screamed.

63
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:55,702
But it could be that the sound was a fake that Thief Kid played,

64
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,002
and if at that point, Kid had finished

65
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,902
passing the keys around to his accomplices.

66
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:03,202
The moment we heard Conan scream

67
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,702
and moved away from the pedestal,

68
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:08,802
they could've turned the keys all at the same time.

69
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:10,702
That's true.

70
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,902
But are you sure all of you were guarding

71
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:17,302
the keyholes of the pedestal up until this time?

72
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:19,602
Yeah, we did!

73
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:21,902
With my hands spread out like this!

74
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:23,402
I was leaning against the pedestal,

75
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:25,402
covering the keyhole of the pedestal.

76
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:29,202
By the way, who was guarding which pedestal?

77
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:31,702
The one I guarded...

78
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,102
was that black pedestal!

79
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,602
I was in charge of the green pedestal!

80
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:41,602
I watched the white pedestal.

81
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:45,302
And I watched this red pedestal!

82
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:48,327
But, weren't you afraid?

83
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:49,702
Because although there was a black-out,

84
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:52,702
there was electricity going through the pedestals, you know.

85
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,102
Well, as for that...

86
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:57,502
Hey, gramps!

87
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,802
This floor is rotten here and there,

88
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:03,802
but isn't there an iron board inside like there is in the walls?

89
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:06,345
No. As to underneath the floor,

90
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:07,802
the ceiling and the pillars in the four corners,

91
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,702
I haven't touched them

92
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,502
because they were built intricately to begin with.

93
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:15,502
Well, he won't get away

94
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:19,002
because I've laid barbed wired all over underneath the floor!

95
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:21,602
Excuse me.

96
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:25,102
If you say that Kid's accomplices are among us,

97
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,902
I know someone who is suspicious.

98
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:29,602
This guy's who's in charge of audio!

99
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,102
What?

100
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:34,002
A young staff was supposed to come,

101
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,902
but he suddenly switched.

102
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:41,402
That's because I suddenly couldn't get in touch with him.

103
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,402
Talk for yourself too,

104
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,002
-then, you're just as suspicious as me! -Huh?

105
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:48,702
The person who was supposed to be in charge of the camera

106
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,202
was your subordinate in college,

107
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,391
but you forced your way to come here

108
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,302
saying that you are an old timer at this job.

109
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:54,902
What the heck are you talking about?

110
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,395
The one who called me saying that

111
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,397
he just got out of college and didn't have confidence

112
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,902
to handle a live broadcast is him, you know!

113
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:04,403
I heard so, too.

114
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,502
That advisor Suzuki went out of his way

115
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:06,802
to get the children uniformed parkas,

116
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,407
and that he also wanted a person

117
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,409
who was at home at the camera for this job,

118
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,411
so he switched cameramen.

119
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,902
I went out of my way

120
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:16,202
only because the TV station told me that

121
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,417
it would be more exciting that way.

122
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:19,602
Moreover, wasn't it you people

123
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,702
who told me the phone number to the company

124
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:24,423
who sells the parkas and introduced them to me? TV crew!

125
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,902
Huh? Me? I know nothing of it.

126
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:31,902
Did you call us over here

127
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,433
because somebody told you to do so, too?

128
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:39,502
No. It was written in post script in his letter of warning.

129
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,802
"Let's not resort to childish pranks this time,

130
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:45,302
and decide victory by adult means", you see!

131
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:49,402
So, I took it that he wasn't at home with children

132
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:53,102
and called the Detective Squad over here!

133
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:54,453
It's true

134
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,455
that if the phone call that the TV station received

135
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:59,102
was from Thief Kid,

136
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:00,802
he probably deliberately tried

137
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,102
to get rid of young people coming to this site.

138
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,502
But, if so,

139
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:09,602
why would he write something like that in postscript?

140
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,902
It's more than likely, judging from the personality of the advisor,

141
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,302
that if something like that were to be written,

142
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:17,302
he would most obviously call the Detective Squad over here.

143
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:22,002
But this case is full of mysteries.

144
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,602
It's strange that the treasure

145
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,485
that was taken is nowhere in sight either,

146
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,902
but the same goes for the four keys

147
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:31,402
that the advisor nailed to the wall.

148
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:35,802
If he nailed the keys on only slightly...

149
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,402
After using the keys,

150
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,902
if the keys were to be nailed back on to the wall,

151
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,902
the noise would be really loud.

152
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:46,505
But there was no such sound in the video that we just watched.

153
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,502
Maybe the fluorescent paint on the keys and the keyholes

154
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:50,802
are only tricks for diversion,

155
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:53,502
and the method explained on the pillar

156
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,515
that required using no keys was carried out after...

157
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:03,302
Gosh. How long to you intend to keep sleeping?

158
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:04,523
Lend me a hand, will you?

159
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:08,002
-White... -Huh?

160
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:10,302
Conan, are you up?

161
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,602
Not so loud.

162
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,537
Is the fact that you're up now a secret?

163
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,539
How come?

164
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:25,402
Idiot! This is the first time Kid ever passed me out.

165
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:29,402
How can I get up when I don't even know why he did that?

166
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,551
By the way, what's the beeping sound?

167
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,802
That's the sound of the electricity

168
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:38,102
that runs through the pedestals turning off!

169
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:40,902
It seems that the sound of the pedestals turn off

170
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:42,561
in the order of green, red, white and black.

171
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:45,302
That's why the Inspector asked us to guard the pedestals

172
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:48,567
according to the sound as they turn off.

173
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,502
And tell me the position of Kid's cards

174
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,602
that are stuck to the pedestals?

175
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,702
-The position? -Yeah.

176
00:09:57,702 --> 00:09:59,102
Only on the red pedestal,

177
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:01,702
the card was stuck right above the keyhole.

178
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,302
I can see from here that on the green pedestal,

179
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:07,402
it's stuck a little more above that,

180
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:09,802
but I can't see the black and white one.

181
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,902
The white is the same as the red,

182
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,702
and the card's right above the keyhole!

183
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:17,002
The card is more above by the black than the green!

184
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:22,302
I see. That's how it works.

185
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,402
Okay. Will you surround my body

186
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,602
so that nobody can see me?

187
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,702
This position that I'm in is killing me.

188
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:41,402
What we don't want to see will be exposed, too.

189
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:45,502
No, that was just coincidence.

190
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,502
Dirty brat.

191
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:49,302
Come off it, if I were really dirty,

192
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:52,302
I'd keep my mouth shut and continue looking.

193
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:55,902
Conan!

194
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:03,002
I got it! The reason Kid knocked me out.

195
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,202
No joke?

196
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,302
And of course...

197
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:11,602
who Thief Kid is disguised as, among them!

198
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,252
Won't you notify one of the riot officers for me?

199
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:23,552
I'm sure that somewhere on the temple grounds,

200
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:27,952
the person that Thief Kid had disguised as, is being confined,

201
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,052
so notify the riot police officers

202
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,252
and have them look for him.

203
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:36,252
But, which riot officer do we notify?

204
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:40,952
True. If Kid's accomplices are among the them...

205
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:44,452
No, none of Kid's accomplices are here.

206
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:45,852
What?

207
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:51,652
Kid stole the giraffe horns with amber in them all alone.

208
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:56,152
By taking advantage of his four henchmen that knew nothing!

209
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:58,452
Four henchmen?

210
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,952
Don't tell me...

211
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,352
Hurry and open that door up

212
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,552
so that the officers can pursue Kid!

213
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,707
No, I can't open the door.

214
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:09,852
Why not?

215
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:16,052
I can't help feeling that he's still here in the room somewhere.

216
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,252
I can't shake the feeling

217
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:21,452
that he's waiting for the door to open any minute.

218
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:25,452
Exactly. Don't open the door.

219
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:31,452
Because he's probably surprised at what a tough time

220
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,352
he's having trying to escaping and cold sweating

221
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,552
somewhere in this room where there are no accomplices.

222
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:39,752
No accomplices?

223
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:42,252
Hey, hey. Have you forgotten?

224
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:43,752
You've got to insert the four keys

225
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:45,952
into the four keyholes at the same time

226
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:48,747
and turn the keys a the same time too, you know.

227
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,452
There're going to have to be at least 4 of them all together

228
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:53,152
including Kid to do it.

229
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,852
And to begin with the four keys

230
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,452
were fixed onto the wall like this

231
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:00,759
by the old man before anything happened.

232
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,052
The keys have nothing to do with what happened

233
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:05,552
because Kid didn't use them!

234
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,452
I told you, didn't I?

235
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:11,952
That there was florescent paint on both the keys and the keyholes.

236
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:15,952
But you don't know when the florescent paint was put there, do you?

237
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:17,152
Right!

238
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:21,452
Thief Kid could've put it on the keys and keyholes

239
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,252
even before the black-out!

240
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:26,352
That's true.

241
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:30,052
But can the giraffe statue be taken out without using the key?

242
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,052
It's written at the foot of the pillar, see?

243
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:35,052
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

244
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,452
without using the correct method,

245
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:40,352
must move with the flow."

246
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,452
This is the after care that Kichiemon Samizu

247
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:46,805
left behind in case the keys are lost.

248
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,809
It means anyone who wants to get a hold of the giraffe horns

249
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,852
without relying on the keys, should go with the flow.

250
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,752
What flow?

251
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,815
The four gods...

252
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,552
The pedestals in the four corners,

253
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:01,652
each represent the legendary deities belonging to the pedestals.

254
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:07,552
This green pedestal represents the Blue Dragon.

255
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:09,652
The white pedestal, the White Tiger!

256
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,652
The black one is the Black Tortoise!

257
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:15,452
And this red pedestal represents the Vermilion Bird!

258
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:20,552
But I wonder if there was a specific order to the four gods?

259
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:22,841
-Seasons! -Seasons?

260
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,843
The Blue Dragon is Spring.

261
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,845
Vermilion Bird, Summer.

262
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,852
The White Tiger, Autumn.

263
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,152
And the Black Tortoise is said to stand for Winter.

264
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:34,552
If "must move with the flow", means...

265
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:37,852
move along with the flow of the seasons.

266
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,552
It means to move your body

267
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,952
in order of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter!

268
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:43,652
Move your body?

269
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:46,852
In other words, bring your body close to the pedestal like this

270
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,652
and tilt your body.

271
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,652
Next, it's you, Ai!

272
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:53,652
Yes.

273
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:55,252
Okay, Ayumi.

274
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:57,752
Yep.

275
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,552
Lastly, it's you, Genta!

276
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:00,879
Aye!

277
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:07,952
The pillar...

278
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,352
Is moving...

279
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:11,252
And closing.

280
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:18,152
It... It's closed!

281
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,752
Now you know

282
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,452
that you can make the pillar go up and down

283
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,052
even without the keys.

284
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:26,905
But it only blacked-out for a mere minute!

285
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,152
Are you saying that Kid during this time

286
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:31,852
ran around the room without any light,

287
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:35,752
stuck cards to all the pedestals and tilted them?

288
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:39,952
Kid didn't. We're the ones who tilted them.

289
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,921
Because we were told to guard keyholes of

290
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,352
the green, red, white and black pedestals.

291
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:50,352
Isn't that right, Inspector Nakamori?

292
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:54,352
Rather... Mr. Magician under the Moonlight?

293
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:57,252
I see.

294
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:59,352
In order to guard the keyhole,

295
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:01,752
you'd have to bring your back close to the pedestal,

296
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,352
and guard the surroundings.

297
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:06,552
Hey, hey.

298
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:08,947
Then just how in the world did I stick the cards on?

299
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,652
He made us do that, too!

300
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:12,951
By cracking the window,

301
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:14,652
letting the rain and wind come in

302
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,452
and making us wear our hoods.

303
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:17,952
He made us stick the cards

304
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,952
with a sticky seal on them that were hidden inside the hood

305
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,952
and stuck to our backs when we leaned against the pedestals!

306
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:26,965
As proof of that, the position the cards are pasted on,

307
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,967
each correspond to the height of the one

308
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,969
who was guarding the pedestal, right?

309
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,952
Now that you mentioned it...

310
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,752
Kid most probably called Advisor Suzuki

311
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:39,452
using the voice of the reporter told him

312
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:43,252
that he would introduce a company that sold the parkas,

313
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,352
and planted tricks on them himself.

314
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,652
But it's amazing how the cards were stuck

315
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,652
onto the corresponding pedestals in the dark,

316
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,991
without making a mistake.

317
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,352
As far as what was seen on the VTR,

318
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:58,352
there was nothing like a signal.

319
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,552
Sound...

320
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,552
He told us!

321
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:07,352
To wait for the sound of the electricity flowing

322
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:08,752
through the pedestals turn off,

323
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:11,352
then, to guard the pedestals in that order!

324
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:14,352
I didn't set up such a sound though.

325
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,252
Of course there was!

326
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,552
It beeped.

327
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:19,352
An irritating sound.

328
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,952
-Did you hear such a sound? -No.

329
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,452
Not at all.

330
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,023
What?

331
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,027
Mosquito sound.

332
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:31,852
A high frequency sound

333
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:35,352
that gradually becomes inaudible to people over the age of 20

334
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:37,452
because the ears start to age.

335
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:41,052
He played that sound that only the children could hear,

336
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:43,652
and let them know what order to tilt the pedestals.

337
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,152
If nobody mentions anything regardless of the sound being heard,

338
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:49,047
everything would seem normal.

339
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,652
That's why you removed

340
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,051
all the young staff from the TV crew, right?

341
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:55,752
To avoid having anyone else hear that sound.

342
00:17:55,752 --> 00:18:01,059
You told us nothing about that mosquito sound, though.

343
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,352
Sorry.

344
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:05,552
Then, where are the horns of the giraffe?

345
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,952
Oh, that's...

346
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,071
Inside the hood of my parka!

347
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,652
He pretended to take me,

348
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,352
who was knocked out by the stun gun to the hospital

349
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:21,079
and was planning to make it out of here, treasure and all!

350
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,652
Although, I realized right away when I got up

351
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:25,852
because of the weight of the treasure I felt.

352
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:29,087
By the way, he used the florescent paint

353
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,552
when the advisor handed over the keys

354
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:35,093
to show us the statue of the giraffe.

355
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:38,752
Back then, if he put florescent paint on the keys,

356
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,252
then the keyholes where the keys are inserted

357
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,352
will also have paint on them!

358
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:45,103
Then, where's the real Inspector?

359
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:49,107
Probably knocked out by a stun gun and around here some place.

360
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:52,752
Open the door!

361
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:56,452
The one that's inside is Kid disguised as me!

362
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,252
-Why not let him in? -Open the door!

363
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:03,852
But, if he came to get his accomplices out of here...

364
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,952
If he wanted to, he would've done that long ago!

365
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:10,352
-True! -Open the door!

366
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,952
The one that's inside is Kid disguised as me!

367
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,452
Okay, open the door!

368
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,752
How about it, Kid?

369
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:28,452
I've stamped all the adults except you.

370
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:32,052
Now you can't disguise yourself as someone else!

371
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:37,652
Because the one with no stamp on his face is you!

372
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:42,152
So, this is it, for you.

373
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:46,152
I wonder about that.

374
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,552
-Genta? -Turn on the lights!

375
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:01,652
Look for him!

376
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,252
The one that doesn't have a stamp on his face!

377
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:06,252
That's Kid!

378
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:08,152
But, Inspector.

379
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:11,189
Everybody's face is stamped.

380
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,652
Kid is nowhere in sight!

381
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:16,852
Impossible!

382
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:19,752
Where the heck did he disappear to?

383
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,352
He can't possibly disguise himself as a child.

384
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,852
Hey!

385
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:26,952
Help me!

386
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:28,652
Genta!

387
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:30,552
What happened? What's with that hole?

388
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:32,452
I don't know!

389
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:35,213
Somebody grabbed me in the dark

390
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:38,052
and I was shoved into this hole!

391
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,217
Come to think of it,

392
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:42,252
Kid disguised as Inspector Nakamori

393
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:44,552
was touching the floor.

394
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,852
He probably set up a simple bomb at that time

395
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,552
and opened a hole in the floor,

396
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:52,652
used Genta as the lid and escaped under the floor.

397
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,952
Okay! Kid is under the floor!

398
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:57,235
Open it.

399
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,237
Okay, I got it.

400
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,252
Genta, you stay right there and don't move, okay?

401
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:05,552
If somebody grabs your legs,

402
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:08,052
shout really loud and let us know, okay?

403
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:09,247
Okay.

404
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,552
Hey! Did you find him?

405
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,352
No, not yet.

406
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:14,152
Hold it.

407
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:18,152
Genta's 10 yen sized baldness, if I remember correctly...

408
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,752
Thief Kid!

409
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:30,952
I'll give this back to you.

410
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:33,271
It wasn't what I after to begin with!

411
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,273
When on earth did you...

412
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:37,652
What about Genta?

413
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,752
He's asleep under the floor.

414
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,852
Fast asleep.

415
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,281
I see.

416
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,552
So he just wanted to prove

417
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:47,852
that he could even disguise himself as a child.

418
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,287
Right!

419
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,289
I wanted to prove...

420
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:57,295
that nothing is impossible for Thief Kid!

421
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,052
-See you! -Hold it.

422
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,452
You've forgotten something.

423
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:07,852
That riot officer is Kid!

424
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,307
-Nab him! -What?

425
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,052
Kid?

426
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:14,852
If I make it into the woods in this disguise,

427
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:18,152
they wouldn't be able to tell me apart from the others.

428
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,052
"1 hour later" -Thief Kid detected!

429
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,552
6 kilometers west of the mountain temple.

430
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:50,552
It's Kid! There he is!

431
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:53,411
Why? How can they tell?

432
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,413
"I have obtained the Giraffe horns. -Thief Kid"

433
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:59,417
You're paying me back for passing me out, Kid!

434
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,092
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,423
"Scarecrow"

436
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,194
Next time he may become you.

437
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:09,427
Idiot, I'll never let him to that.

438
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,780
Really?
