1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,540
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,540
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,240
A mysterious separate building on the legendary pond.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,140
The windmill turns as the water changes color.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,790
Mr. Mouri? You mean that renowned detective?

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,790
Yes, well...

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,590
I got a notice from Mr. Shiro Suzuki of the Suzuki financial group

11
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,490
that someone else would be attending in his place,

12
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,490
but I had no idea that it would be you.

13
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,890
Don't be too hard on me, please.

14
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,190
Just as expected from the master of the tea ceremony.

15
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,490
What a splendid house!

16
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,190
A tea ceremony, what a drag.

17
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,490
I wonder why I came along.

18
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,790
Conan, let's go.

19
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,390
Okay.

20
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,690
I guess I'll have to go through with it.

21
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,990
"The Legend Of The Five Colored Water Palace (Part 1)"

22
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,890
How beautiful! Fantastic!

23
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,590
What a terrific scenic view it is!

24
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,090
How wondrous for it to be glowing golden.

25
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,390
You can say that again.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,790
Is this the first time you've seen a pond?

27
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,390
At this time of year, depending on the angle of the sun,

28
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,090
the surface of the water changes into five different colors.

29
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,390
I see.

30
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,690
So that's why your home

31
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,090
is called the "Five Colored Water Palace".

32
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,190
That's right.

33
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,090
By the way, may I ask what your names are?

34
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,190
Oh, how rude of me.

35
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,890
They are the master's disciples.

36
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,790
"Morio Yakura (42)" -This is Mr. Yakura, an antique dealer,

37
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,890
"Yukari Mimura (33)" -And she is a company owner, Ms. Mimura.

38
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,990
Hello.

39
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,590
He is the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri and his family.

40
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,290
You mean that famous detective?

41
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,090
What an honor.

42
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,290
"Yoshiko Hanasaki (40)" -Now that you are all here,

43
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,890
I will go and inform the master.

44
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,890
Master?

45
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,090
The master of the tea ceremony.

46
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,590
How interesting.

47
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,790
I wonder what sort of reception

48
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,990
the finicky master is going to give Mr. Renowned Detective?

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,790
That's why I didn't want to come here in his place.

50
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,190
I'm sorry, but Sonoko pleaded with me.

51
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,990
Huh? It's the maid.

52
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,790
Which means that the master is there.

53
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,790
Is that building in the middle of the pond the tea room?

54
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,790
Huh? Oh, I guess so.

55
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,390
The solemn atmosphere is just fantastic!

56
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,290
It is indeed the world of "Wabi Sabi"!

57
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,890
I'm sure that's the tea room!

58
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,390
Yes, that's right.

59
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,290
It is called the "Five Colored Retreat"

60
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,790
because it is built on top of the pond that changes color.

61
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,990
It was built to get away from worldly affairs

62
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,490
as well as to forget about time.

63
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,490
It's called the "Five Colored Retreat"?

64
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,690
What a wonderful tea room.

65
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,390
Hello, Ryoichi.

66
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,090
He is the master's son.

67
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,790
"Ryoichi Aonogi (28)" -Mr. Mouri.

68
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,190
Thank you for coming all this way.

69
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,590
Oh, you've already heard about him?

70
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,390
While you're at it,

71
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,290
why don't you tell him about the monster story, too?

72
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,490
Monster? What is that about?

73
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,690
Well, it is what you would call a superstition regarding this pond.

74
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,690
No, let's not talk about it.

75
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,690
I just came to say hello, so if you will excuse me.

76
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,490
Good grief.

77
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,690
Ms. Mimura, I think you gave Ryoichi a bad time.

78
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,890
Well, let me tell you about it

79
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,990
over some plain hot water over there.

80
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,990
I hear it was towards the end of the Edo Period.

81
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,290
This pond used to be filled with cold and clear spring water,

82
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,790
and was much larger than it is now.

83
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,190
Now, a beautiful woman appears near the pond.

84
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,190
She plays the flute and changes the color of the pond,

85
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,190
entertaining all who come to see her.

86
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,590
One day, a wealthy merchant fell for the woman.

87
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,890
He then built a house near the pond.

88
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,290
The woman married the man under one condition.

89
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,490
She said, "The pond is mine, and no one shall set foot on it".

90
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,090
However, the merchant breaks this promise,

91
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,290
and builds the bedroom in the middle of the pond.

92
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,290
Not only does he get angry at his wife

93
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,890
who clings to him and pleads him to move the bedroom away,

94
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,590
He kills her...

95
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,890
and sinks her body into the pond.

96
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,890
One night, however, a large serpent appears from the pond

97
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,390
and attacks the merchant.

98
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,190
The serpent turns out to be the woman.

99
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,690
She became the monster that resides in the pond.

100
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,490
Although the merchant is badly wounded,

101
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,890
he somehow makes it back to the bedroom.

102
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,690
Since there is a talisman for keeping away evil spirits

103
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,890
was posted in the room,

104
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,790
he was no longer in danger of being attacked.

105
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,390
However, the monster kept waiting day and night

106
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,190
for the merchant to come out.

107
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,390
The merchant was exhausted beyond capacity.

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,090
It is said to have hung himself in the building.

109
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,990
It is still said today that the pond changes color

110
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,390
because the monster changes into the figure of the woman

111
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,090
and appears to blow the flute.

112
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,390
To think that there is a story like that about the pond...

113
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,390
Everyone!

114
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,190
Thank you very much for waiting.

115
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,390
Please follow me to the tea room.

116
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,890
Huh? Isn't Ryoichi joining us?

117
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,890
Although he is the master of the tea ceremony's son,

118
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,790
he isn't the least bit interested on it.

119
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,590
Oh, that sure is a problem.

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,390
Anyway, I haven't said my greetings to the master yet.

121
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,090
Please excuse the rudeness.

122
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,490
The master rarely comes out recently.

123
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,490
He does not in particular, cross this bridge alone.

124
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,090
Master, I've brought the guests.

125
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,390
Master?

126
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,290
Maybe the monster ate him up?

127
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,690
Just what are you doing?

128
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,290
Monster!

129
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,790
How rude of you to look inside like that!

130
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,690
This is a sacred tea room, understand?

131
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,890
Leave! Leave this tea room right this minute!

132
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,590
Master, please calm down.

133
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,190
He is our guest today, Mr. Mouri!

134
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,290
What? A guest?

135
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,290
You mean that person who came on behalf of...

136
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,790
Goodness.

137
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,490
Huh? A windmill in a place like that?

138
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,090
Excuse me, is that windmill there just for decoration?

139
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,190
That's used to send water to the river in the garden.

140
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,090
I hear it operates electrically now.

141
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,190
A timer is set and it moves accordingly.

142
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,090
It used to be famous as the water used for tea.

143
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,690
But ever since this tea room was built,

144
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,390
the amount of water decreased drastically.

145
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,090
Ms. Mimura, the master will hear you.

146
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,990
I'm sorry for my rudeness a while ago,

147
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,690
in spite of you having come all this way.

148
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,390
Thank you for spending your time here with me today.

149
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,490
Thank you for inviting us over.

150
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,690
Talismans for keeping away evil spirits.

151
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,190
There are talismans posted everywhere.

152
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,290
Is he afraid of the monster of the pond, after all?

153
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,090
Master, did you already look at the object that I asked Ms. Hanasaki

154
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,790
to hand over to you a while ago?

155
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,890
Huh?

156
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,190
It is an object that had been handed down for generations,

157
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,890
and was given to me by a master ceramist from Kyushu.

158
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,890
"Ryozo Aonogi (65)" -I'm surprised that you got hold a of it.

159
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,890
Although it's simply expected of

160
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,090
one who runs a large scale business in antiques.

161
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,890
I shall use that tea bowl

162
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,090
during the tea ceremony to be held this evening.

163
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,290
Thank you very much.

164
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,490
That tea bowl is likely to be very fitting.

165
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,590
It will add glamour to my last practice of the tea ceremony.

166
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,990
What do you mean by "last"?

167
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,590
Mr. Mouri, today we have some fish that is superb

168
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,190
as a side dish to drinking sake

169
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,290
that we would like for you to taste.

170
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,890
Okay...

171
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,790
Ms. Hanasaki, will you warm up the sake for us?

172
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,290
-Master! -Master!

173
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,890
Master.

174
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,090
Final tea ceremony?

175
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,590
Just what does he mean?

176
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,290
My feet are numb!

177
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,990
Dad, how embarrassing!

178
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,590
I'm going to get ready for the night,

179
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,390
so don't let anybody come near the tea room.

180
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,390
Yes, master.

181
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,190
Where are you going, Ms. Mimura?

182
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,790
I've got another commitment.

183
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,190
Just what do you mean?

184
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,790
I'll be right back!

185
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,990
How selfish can she get?

186
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,090
The master personally invited us, and yet...

187
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,590
Mr. Yakura, the bath is ready.

188
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,690
Thank you so much.

189
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,790
The water of the pond has changed color!

190
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,990
The reflection from the light is gone,

191
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,190
and the inside of the pond can be seen, that's why it's green.

192
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,790
Next, it will change to crimson when the sun tilts its angle.

193
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,290
Ms. Hanasaki, what on earth happened to this fishing rod?

194
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,590
Well...

195
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,290
Master told me to burn it.

196
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,790
I thought so.

197
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,990
No, Mr. Ryoichi!

198
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,290
Ryoichi!

199
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,090
We have guests tonight,

200
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,590
so I'd advise you to wait until the tea ceremony is over.

201
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,090
I know, I'm just going to put my fishing rod away.

202
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,790
Fishing is Ryoichi's only hobby.

203
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,790
What a cruel thing for the master to do.

204
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,190
But to suddenly burst out in rage,

205
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,990
and burn fishing goods out of the blue?

206
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,590
I wonder if you can call that mere foul temperament.

207
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,290
His wife passed away

208
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,090
exactly during the completion of that tea room last year.

209
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,390
She took the legend very seriously

210
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,990
and was against the building of the tea room to the very end.

211
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,490
It sure sounds familiar.

212
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,590
Yes, sort of.

213
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,490
Among us, it is rumored

214
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,790
that some have seen the shadow of the monster.

215
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,290
I see.

216
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,490
In other words, you're saying

217
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,790
that the master has become difficult to get along with

218
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,690
because of his fear for the monster?

219
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,190
Not really. He laughs it off saying

220
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,690
that it's superstition without any grounds.

221
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,190
I'll go get the bath ready.

222
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,690
I guess I'll go take a bath, then.

223
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,390
Please excuse me.

224
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,090
I wonder if there is really such a thing as a monster?

225
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,190
Don't be ridiculous!

226
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,990
Who is it?

227
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,180
Huh? You're...

228
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,680
Are you bored?

229
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,480
Sort of.

230
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,080
Did you catch that big fish?

231
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,380
Yes, that's right.

232
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,080
Conan, there you are!

233
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,580
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,180
Shall we go to the guest room and eat some candy?

235
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,680
Okay.

236
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Hey! Conan, where were you?

237
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,380
He was at Ryoichi's room for a while.

238
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,480
There was a large fish print decorating his room.

239
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,080
Well, Ryoichi is really something.

240
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,480
He invites me to go night fishing with him sometimes,

241
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,580
but I can't come anywhere near him when it comes to catching fish.

242
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,480
That's the burglar alarm.

243
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,780
Maybe somebody's come.

244
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Huh?

245
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,680
Why might she be looking around?

246
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,180
Huh?

247
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,480
Look, the pond is red now!

248
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,980
It's so bright that I can't bare looking at it.

249
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,180
It's 4pm.

250
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,880
Just about this time, the sunlight diffuses reflection

251
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh, I'm so hot.

252
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Ms Hanasaki, do you have anything cold to drink?

253
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,780
Ms. Mimura, where were you?

254
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,580
What? It's none of your business, isn't it?

255
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,380
Her clothes are falling apart and she is sweating profusely.

256
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,080
She must've been in one heck of a rush.

257
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,580
Ms. Mimura, how rude of you!

258
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
He invited you ever, after all, you know.

259
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,980
Just who the heck do you think you are?

260
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,480
It's a tea ceremony that is to be given by the master!

261
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
It is utterly rude to run out on him like that!

262
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,680
Come on now, both of you.

263
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,280
I hear that this will be the last tea ceremony

264
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,080
he will be carrying out.

265
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,280
That's it!

266
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,980
I'll bet you were dying to have the master resign!

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,380
Just what do you mean by that, Ms. Mimura?

268
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,580
I would rather you not make ugly assumptions!

269
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,780
Now, now.

270
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,480
All right. I'm so sorry.

271
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
Oh, how upsetting!

272
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,980
Even the color of the pond looks hot.

273
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,080
What's wrong?

274
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,880
That's...

275
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,780
It's the master!

276
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,880
Father?

277
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,780
Father?

278
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,480
What's with all this blood?

279
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
No good, the door is locked!

280
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,280
Is there any other entrance?

281
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,580
The washing basin entrance is behind.

282
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,880
Ryoichi!

283
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,080
The door to the washing basin is also locked!

284
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
We've got no choice, let's kick the door open!

285
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,780
Please move out of the way.

286
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Master?

287
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,580
Master!

288
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,880
No good. He's dead.

289
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,580
Father...

290
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,980
It's the legend!

291
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Just as in the legend, Master was killed by the monster!

292
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,880
Father!

293
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,480
Thank you.

294
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,080
Huh? Hello there, Conan.

295
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,880
Officer Yokomizo?

296
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,380
Which means that Mr. Mouri is also here, right?

297
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,880
Yes, he's over there.

298
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Hello, Mr. Mouri. I'm sure glad to see you again.

299
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,180
I'm sure not happy to see you, though.

300
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,180
You don't have to hide your embarrassment.

301
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,580
Officer Yokomizo.

302
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,980
What we've found out so far is that

303
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,680
this door of the miniature entrance was locked

304
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,080
from the inside by a long wooden stick.

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,780
As for the window, the sliding door was slightly open.

306
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,380
However, as you can see, it is blocked by a trellis.

307
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,580
To the east, there is the entrance to the washing basin,

308
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,280
but this was also locked from the inside.

309
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,980
Are you saying that all the doors were locked?

310
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,580
Yes.

311
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,380
The estimated time of death is between 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm.

312
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,180
The corpse was bleeding

313
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,580
However, the direct cause of death

314
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,480
is thought to be suffocation by strangulation

315
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,180
It's suicide.

316
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Take a look at the blood stain.

317
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,180
The master first tried to commit suicide

318
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,980
by slashing his wrist at the porch.

319
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,480
But he failed, so then he maybe he tried slashing his neck.

320
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,680
If so, that explains the blood stains

321
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,380
that are seen all the way from here to the tea room.

322
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,480
If he failed to commit suicide at the porch

323
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,180
and tried to hang himself,

324
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,780
he wouldn't have had the time to lock the room.

325
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
The windmill is spinning.

326
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,580
Gosh.

327
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,780
Talk about a small entrance!

328
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,580
There are remains of a thumbtack or something

329
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,680
having been stuck in the back of the door.

330
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,780
The rope was cut in a strange fashion.

331
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,380
It seems to have been cut part way,

332
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
but pulled apart towards the end.

333
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,880
The hanging scroll is spread out on the floor.

334
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,380
He must've been getting ready for the tea ceremony

335
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,980
to be held this evening.

336
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,780
Although he was getting prepared,

337
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,380
he impulsively chose to die.

338
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,980
I guess that's what happened.

339
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,380
The writing is only half done.

340
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Huh?

341
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,780
This rubbish? Wooden shavings?

342
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,380
Even on the tatami floor...

343
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,480
I see!

344
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,980
It's wood from the pillar that the rope was tied onto.

345
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,780
Huh? But there is a scrat on the wood that served as support.

346
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,280
I can't see too well.

347
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,680
Hey, when the heck did you get in here?

348
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,280
Stop getting in the way!

349
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,180
Will you carry me on your back?

350
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,880
What the heck are you talking about?

351
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Get out of here!

352
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,780
Hey, what are you try to do?

353
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,880
Just as I thought!

354
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,380
Marks of friction are left on places

355
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,580
other than where the rope was hung.

356
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,180
Moreover, it's still new.

357
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,480
Pops!

358
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,980
Suit yourself!

359
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,880
He was killed by the legendary monster?

360
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Do you expect me, a police officer, to believe that?

361
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,080
There's no doubt about it!

362
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,680
From the blood stains on the porch

363
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
to the fact that he hung himself,

364
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,080
it's all so similar to the legend!

365
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,280
There may be no monster,

366
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,580
but he was killed as the legend said.

367
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,580
So it's just as if he were killed by the monster.

368
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,980
This tea room shouldn't have been built after all.

369
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,880
Right after the completion of the tea room,

370
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,280
his wife dies of a heart attack.

371
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,480
And now the master.

372
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,780
This is unmistakably the doings of the monster.

373
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,780
Which means...

374
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,180
He seems to have been pretty worn out mental,

375
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,080
so I'm pretty sure he committed suicide.

376
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,380
Yes.

377
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,880
No, this is not suicide.

378
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,080
It's homicide!

379
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,980
I'm sure that someone here

380
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,980
schemed a very clever trick and killed the master

381
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,180
after making it look like the master committed suicide!

382
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,480
Who could have done this?

383
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,780
Who is pretending to be the monster?

384
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,300
"Windmill"
