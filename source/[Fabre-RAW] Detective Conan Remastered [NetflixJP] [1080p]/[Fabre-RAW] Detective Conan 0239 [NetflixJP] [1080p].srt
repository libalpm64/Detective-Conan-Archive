1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,290
Even destiny serves as a clue to the deduction.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,290
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,090
Today, the case gets resolved.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,990
Will Conan catch the killer?

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,790
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,250
Upon Heiji Hattori's request,

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,250
we came to Osaka to attend a restaurant's opening party.

10
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,450
Three men own the restaurant,

11
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,950
a former professional boxer named Ricardo Balera,

12
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,050
Major League pitcher Mike Norwood

13
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,250
and professional soccer player Ray Curtis.

14
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,350
But while we were in the midst of helping them with their secret plan,

15
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,250
a gunshot ring out.

16
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,950
When we ran into the room where the gunshot came from,

17
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,050
we found that an American newspaper reporter named Ed McKay

18
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,450
had been shot to death.

19
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,450
"The 3K's Incident in Osaka (Part 2)"

20
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,050
Gosh, thanks to this murder, the party's ruined.

21
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,450
The lottery for the autographed souvenirs was called off too.

22
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,950
Ran, you were lucky you got yours before this happened.

23
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,050
Hey? I just noticed,

24
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,050
where did Conan and Heiji go?

25
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,750
They're probably sticking close to Otaki

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,150
helping with the case.

27
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,650
Helping with the case?

28
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,450
For goodness sakes.

29
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,550
You don't have to worry so much, they'll be fine.

30
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,450
The murder weapon's already been found,

31
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,750
the murderer will be caught in no time.

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,750
I wonder.

33
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,350
It's just a matter of time.

34
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,050
After all, Heiji Hattori's hot on the case.

35
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,250
Yes, I suppose.

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,050
Since the hotel's not open yet,

37
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,050
the elevators weren't operating.

38
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,150
Which means...

39
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,150
those three guys

40
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,750
could only use these stairs to get to each floor.

41
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,050
All the rooms are set up the same

42
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,750
and the light switches are all in this spot.

43
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,950
And there wasn't any sign that the wiring was rigged in any way.

44
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,550
And it seems like the only way to turn the lights on and off

45
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,350
is to press the switch.

46
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,750
Wait a minute.

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,950
I'm sure Mike said he opened the curtains.

48
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,050
If he tied a string to the edge of the curtain

49
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,050
and rigged it so it would open when the string was pulled

50
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,050
he could've opened the curtains while being somewhere else.

51
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,750
I don't think so.

52
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,150
I checked the room Mike worked on, first thing

53
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,050
but I didn't find any trace that string had been tied to the curtain

54
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,650
or any scratch marks left from the string being pulled.

55
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,850
Out of the three, Ray was in the room closest to the scene of the murder

56
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,050
but it would have taken 10 seconds for him to run up the stairs

57
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,250
and get to that room after turning the lights on.

58
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,450
Ray suffers from a chronic articular ailment in his left knee

59
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,150
for it's pretty much impossible for him to have done it.

60
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,450
And for your information, Mike's injured his Achilles tendon

61
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,350
and is undergoing rehabilitation.

62
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,250
And Ricardo has always been a slow runner.

63
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,750
None of the three could have committed the crime in that time span.

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,350
You know, Kudo?

65
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,950
You're acting strange.

66
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,350
Any other time,

67
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,750
if the witnesses to a crime had shaky alibis like these guys,

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,850
you'd have been the first to suspect them!

69
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,950
You think so?

70
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,850
Well, even if they could've made it to the room,

71
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,750
they'd have to knock on the door and by the time the victim let them in,

72
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,750
that would take another five seconds.

73
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,950
No matter how you look at it, it's impossible!

74
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,850
Hey, Kudo, what is that?

75
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,550
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,850
It's just a mop, isn't it?

77
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,350
A mop in a hotel's guest room?

78
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,750
You're right, it is out of place.

79
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,350
Hey, Kudo, you think it's possible?

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,150
The other two might not be able to do it

81
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,550
but if he used what he always does,

82
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,450
he could operate the switches from far away.

83
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,450
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,850
He didn't have it on him and it wasn't in the room.

85
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,250
That's what I want to ask you.

86
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,150
It's such a small thing, you can hide it just about anywhere.

87
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,250
That's ridiculous!

88
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,850
It's absolutely impossible!

89
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,650
And I'll prove it, just you wait!

90
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,250
Kudo, weren't you the one who said...

91
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,250
remove what can't be done and whatever remains,

92
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,750
no matter how unthinkable

93
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,950
that will be the truth.

94
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,750
Isn't that what you said, Kudo?

95
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,900
Are you all right?

96
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,200
Yeah, this old injury still bothers me.

97
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't push yourself so much.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,700
Don't worry about me, the pain eases up when I take my medicine.

99
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Take it easy.

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,900
If "The Steel Barrier" falls to its knees,

101
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
that'll be the end of the game!

102
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
I know, let's go out for a drink later to forget this mess!

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,300
This is a...

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm sure about it this time!

105
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,200
I heard it in some restaurant once.

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Be careful, Ran. It's probably some bad joke.

107
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,100
It's the truth! The person working there was shouting,

108
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,300
I heard the words "band" and "wooden sandals"!

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,900
That reporter Ed was speaking fluent Japanese

110
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,400
and he knew a lot about Japan!

111
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,300
I know it had something to do with a tempura restaurant

112
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,400
or a sushi restaurant or a sukiyaki restaurant, one of those.

113
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,600
I see.

114
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,100
Now, I get it.

115
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
Darn it.

116
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,210
What?

117
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,810
What's this deflated soccer ball doing here?

118
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,710
That means there was an extra one.

119
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,810
Maybe it's a spare?

120
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,010
You think so?

121
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,210
Detective, can we leave already?

122
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,910
Those two said they'd like to go back to the hotel and take a shower.

123
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,910
Well, but...

124
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,710
It shouldn't be a problem, Otaki.

125
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,210
You didn't find any gun powder residue on them, did you?

126
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,910
But still, Heiji.

127
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,810
In exchange...

128
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,210
I'd like you to do me a favor.

129
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,010
A favor?

130
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,610
That's right, Ray.

131
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,610
A favor from you.

132
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,110
Me?

133
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,210
There's someone waiting that I want you to meet

134
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,210
in the room you were just in at the hotel.

135
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,210
I really appreciate it.

136
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,810
Because that person is a great fan of yours.

137
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,910
Oh, my gosh!

138
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,210
Who on earth did this?

139
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,510
-That's right. -What?

140
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,410
It's a very simple set-up.

141
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,710
First, you leave the door wide open

142
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,010
until the door to the hotel room is locked,

143
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,910
then remove the closet's sliding door and take the mop out.

144
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,910
The sliding door is propped up in the position

145
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,210
the light switch will be when it's turned on,

146
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,410
the tip of the mop handle is placed in between the sliding door

147
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,810
and the switch and the sliding door is lifted up,

148
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,910
there, the set-up is ready!

149
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,310
All that's left to do is, take the soccer ball you've prepared

150
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,510
and kick it down the stairs.

151
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,510
If the curtains in the room were already left open,

152
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,710
from out the view outside,

153
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,710
it would've looked like you had turned the lights on.

154
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,310
Isn't that right?

155
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,610
Ray.

156
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,310
After just a couple of trial runs,

157
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,910
even a kid like me managed to do it.

158
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,110
During your career as a mid-fielder,

159
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,510
you, Ray Curtis was known for your scoring goals on free kicks

160
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,710
I bet you could do this with your eyes closed.

161
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,810
That's right. With this method,

162
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,210
you can turn the lights on the first floor on from the second floor

163
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,710
and at almost the same time,

164
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,510
kill the reporter in the room on the second floor,

165
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,510
and claim you were on the first floor all the time.

166
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,710
No way, kid. This is some bad joke.

167
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,810
Let me explain, your plan went something like this.

168
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,310
The lights you were supposed to turn on,

169
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,310
the 5 on the lower second row of the letter K.

170
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,010
You set this up in the room scheduled to be lit up second,

171
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,710
the right end of the first row.

172
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,610
Which is this room in front of the stairs.

173
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,810
After you turned on the first light,

174
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,710
you went to the second room,

175
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,210
set things up

176
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,510
and went upstairs with the gun you'd had hidden and the soccer ball.

177
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,810
Then turned on the lights on

178
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,710
in the third, fourth and fifth rooms on the second floor.

179
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,110
Of course, you deliberately didn't turn the lights on in the second room.

180
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,610
And then, knowing Ran was outside watching,

181
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,210
you brought it to her attention and told her

182
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,010
that you were heading there at that time,

183
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,910
then you kicked the ball down the stairs

184
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,110
which turned the light on in the room.

185
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,810
Then you rushed to the room Ed was waiting in, shot him.

186
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,810
Tossed the gun away...

187
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,910
and ran back downstairs into the room, looked out the window

188
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,010
and pretended to be surprised by the gunshot

189
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,210
giving us the impression, you were there all along.

190
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,410
Have I missed something, Ray?

191
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,210
That's very, very good.

192
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,010
But you know, kid? You've forgotten one thing.

193
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,410
Ran said so herself,

194
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,510
barely three seconds had passed before the light went on

195
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,310
and the gunshot was heard.

196
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,910
It would've been impossible for me to do what you said

197
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,210
in such a short time.

198
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,810
It would take more than 3 seconds to kick the ball,

199
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,210
knock on Ed's door and wait for him to come out.

200
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,810
You probably knocked on the door then kicked the ball, didn't you?

201
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,310
After you knocked on his door,

202
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,710
you went to the stairs

203
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,410
and kicked the ball the same time he opened the door.

204
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,710
As you walked up to him, you spoke into the transceiver,

205
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,210
confirmed the light had been turned out then shot him,

206
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,210
in this order, three seconds is more than enough time.

207
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,810
For your information,

208
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,010
if you were to tie a string to that mop then pull it

209
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,010
you could also turn the light off,

210
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,310
which means Ricardo, who said he was turning the light off

211
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,110
on the fifth floor could also have done it,

212
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,410
however the scene of the murder

213
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,510
was on the second floor, which you were in charge of.

214
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,710
It wouldn't have been possible for him to have committed the murder

215
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,510
without running into you.

216
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,910
The same goes for Mike

217
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,810
who was opening the curtains on the third floor.

218
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,010
That means...

219
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,910
Ray, you're the only one

220
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,910
who could have committed the murder.

221
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,910
But kid, I shot the gun, I should have powder residue on me.

222
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,510
When the police do the test,

223
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,710
they only check the area around the cuffs of the sleeve

224
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,310
and maybe the pants.

225
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,610
They never check the inside of the clothes.

226
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,410
If you took your jacket off

227
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,610
and turned your shirt and pants inside out before firing the gun,

228
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,410
then put your jacket back on before looking out the window

229
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,710
and while you were waiting in the room, fixed your pants and shirt,

230
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,210
you wouldn't test positive.

231
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,210
Isn't the when you used this needle to deflate the ball

232
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,210
and hit it in your shirt?

233
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,810
I went into the toilet right after you came out

234
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,110
and found it in the trash bin,

235
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,910
and there was also an extra ball

236
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,910
under the souvenir table in the party hall, it was deflated.

237
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,010
But you can't prove I put it there.

238
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,110
It's Ed, he's telling us you did it.

239
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,510
The position of Ed's finger on his right hand,

240
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,910
it's in a sushi eating form

241
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,510
the left hand clutching the belt refers to the band.

242
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,710
In sushi restaurants,

243
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,110
the employees use a code of symbols only they understand.

244
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,610
One of the symbols is "band" for the number 8.

245
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,710
He was indicating Ray Curtis whose number is 8, was his killer.

246
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,510
It was his dying message!

247
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,410
I forgot to mention, the towel in the bathroom was wet.

248
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,210
You washed your face and hands, didn't you?

249
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,910
I guess you knew gun powder residue on the skin washed off easily.

250
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,710
It's so ironic.

251
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,010
I set off to prove you were innocent but the more I looked into it

252
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,310
I found more and more evidence against you.

253
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,410
Well, kid. I hate to disappoint you,

254
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,410
but the evidence you mentioned, you can't pin anything on me,

255
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,910
this shirt as well as these pants,

256
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,210
they're spare clothes I had my agent hang on to for me.

257
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,610
I changed them just now because I perspired so much.

258
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,710
And since my agent took the other set back,

259
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,410
they should be in the hotel laundry by now.

260
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,710
What about your shoes?

261
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,710
My shoes?

262
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,010
If the gun's an automatic, when the cartridge...

263
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,410
Gunshot flies out, some powder does, too.

264
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,210
In the case of gunshot a revolver,

265
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,710
it flies out radially, the barrel being the center point.

266
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,610
And of course, it'll fall onto the shoes, too.

267
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,910
Ray, you were wearing shoes when you shot him, weren't you?

268
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,510
After all, you had to make sure you kicked the ball accurately.

269
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,010
If you haven't changed them, it should show powder residue.

270
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,710
I believe that would be solid proof.

271
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,710
Turn yourself in.

272
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,510
I'm asking you to turn yourself in, Ray.

273
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,010
Please.

274
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,010
Sorry, kid. I'm not going to do that.

275
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,810
If I'm arrested, my fans and my family

276
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,710
will be very sad.

277
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,410
Thanks for the warning, I'll go polish my shoes now.

278
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,710
So that I have an excuse for the police.

279
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,710
Wait!

280
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,610
That's not the only thing you have to explain.

281
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,710
Isn't that right, Europe's steel stronghold?

282
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,110
Ray Curtis!

283
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,110
What's the matter?

284
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,810
What's the matter, Ray?

285
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,110
That's the kind of shot they teach in high school.

286
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,010
You should've been able to stop that with one arm.

287
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,910
What's the matter with you?

288
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,110
Come on, answer me.

289
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,810
Answer me, Ray!

290
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,110
So when'd you figure it out

291
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,110
that my body was being eaten away by drugs, kid?

292
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,710
Yawning and pain in the joints

293
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,310
are signs of drug withdrawal.

294
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,010
When you came out of the toilet

295
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,310
holding your right knee instead of the left which you'd injured long ago,

296
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,310
that's when I figured it out.

297
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,310
The reason addicts don't stop using drugs

298
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,110
is partly because of the euphoria

299
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,610
and also because they can't stand the pain in their muscles and joints

300
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,910
when they do into withdrawal.

301
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,210
Like the newspaper article said, your so-called super plays were...

302
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,910
No, you're wrong!

303
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,810
I started using drugs after that.

304
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,710
Everything he wrote was a lie

305
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,010
but it caused my wife to commit suicide

306
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,110
so I came up with a plan to get back at Ed.

307
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,010
I fueled his suspicions and lured him here to Japan

308
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,010
because this is where my wife was born and raised.

309
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,910
Under an alias name, I told him to meet me in Japan

310
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,510
and I'd sell him information about Ray's drug addiction.

311
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,910
Then, to forget the grief I felt over losing my wife Keiko,

312
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,310
who I loved more than anything. I had to...

313
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,510
I had to rely on drugs, it was the only way.

314
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,010
Stop.

315
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,110
Stop it, Ray.

316
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,210
Even if you were facing a bitter aspect of your life,

317
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,010
you have no excuse to resort to drugs and murder, that's foul play.

318
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,310
You deserve a red card, you're a loser.

319
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,410
You're right. I don't belong on the field anymore.

320
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,410
I'll step down from my position.

321
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,810
For both my late wife...

322
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,910
and for my fans, like you.

323
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:34,510
After that, Ray turned himself in to the Osaka Prefecture Police.

324
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,310
Goal keeper, uniform number 8 left the field, never to return again.

325
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,610
"Hattori's Home"

326
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,210
Are you serious?

327
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,810
Did he really say he wasn't going to the game in Nagai?

328
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,410
But he was looking forward to it so much.

329
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,410
Do you think it's because Ray's not going to be playing?

330
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,210
No way, there's going to be so many other great players in that game.

331
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,210
So why then?

332
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,510
Beats me.

333
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,510
If Conan's anything like Shinichi,

334
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,210
we've got a lot to worry about though.

335
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,510
That Shinichi, he might like something a whole lot

336
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,010
but if he finds something the least bit wrong,

337
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,510
he'll do a complete turnaround and hate that thing,

338
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,010
he's a little childish in that way.

339
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,610
Maybe Conan's the same and he'll start to hate soccer.

340
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,010
I don't know what everybody likes about this game.

341
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,210
All you do is kick the ball!

342
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,510
You're lousy.

343
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,410
What'd you say?

344
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,810
This is how you do it!

345
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,010
It looks like you had nothing to worry about, Ran.

346
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,010
They look like real brothers, don't they?

347
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,310
They sure do.

348
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

349
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,220
"Toilet In The Train"

350
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,740
The next episode takes place in a bullet train.

351
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,900
They've been doing away with dining cars lately, haven't they?

352
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:41,620
Do you miss them?

353
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,720
Yes.
