1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,730
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,730
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,330
Naniwa is the stage for a tag team match of Conan and Heiji.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,830
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,630
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,530
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,130
"Osaka Double Mystery:"

8
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,130
"The Naniwa Swordsman And Hideyoshi Toyotomi's Castle"

9
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,730
"Naniwa Chuo Gymnasium"

10
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,230
Strike to the mask!

11
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,630
Match is over!

12
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,030
Nice going! That's 3 wins and 1 draw,

13
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,430
he qualifies for the preliminaries!

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,330
Right. All the members on Kaiho High School's team this year is strong.

15
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,530
They're undefeated so far in the group competition.

16
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,630
Mrs. Hattori. Don't get all worked up

17
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,030
until you're seen our captain.

18
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,830
Heiji's gotten stronger than a demon.

19
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,630
Oh, is Heiji Kaiho High's captain?

20
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,530
He doesn't tell us anything at home.

21
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,030
Kaiho High School team captain, come forward!

22
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,030
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,530
Huh? That's not Heiji.

24
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,130
Isn't that him over there?

25
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,130
Over there, surrounded by all those girls and talking up a storm.

26
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,930
Hey, Heiji!

27
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,430
What the heck are you doing, goofing off over here for?

28
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,830
The match has already started! You've got to hurry!

29
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,830
Huh? You're pale.

30
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,430
Hello.

31
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,830
I know you. You're a sophomore, aren't you?

32
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,530
Heiji asked me to cover for him.

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,530
He said that we probably wouldn't need him until the semi-finals

34
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,630
so he told me to put his gear on

35
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,030
and just intimidate the other team.

36
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,030
But Heiji's so popular so all the girls flock around me

37
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,630
when they see his name on the uniform.

38
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,930
So where did Heiji go?

39
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,830
I think he went to the toilet.

40
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,730
I saw him heading toward the other building.

41
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,830
"Annex" -Listen up.

42
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,030
I'm going to tell you one more time.

43
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,730
To get to the Naniwa Chuo Gymnasium,

44
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,530
take the bus headed for Tojiri

45
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,030
and get off at the 7th stop.

46
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,330
If you don't know which bus, ask the driver.

47
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,130
Ask them which gymnasium is holding the Kinki Kendo Competition

48
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,230
that Heiji Hattori's competing in, they'll know!

49
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,430
Okay, I got it.

50
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,030
I'm not a little kid. You don't have to keep reminding me.

51
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,830
Sorry. You look like a little kid, so I forget.

52
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,130
Never mind, just don't call me anymore.

53
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,330
I'm having a hard time getting away from Ran and the old man.

54
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,130
And another thing. We're going to Osaka

55
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,830
because you invited us to a tetchiri dinner

56
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,930
since we didn't get to eat it the last time

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,030
or the time before that at your place.

58
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,030
The only reason we're going to watch you compete is,

59
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,730
it's on the same day.

60
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,130
You always give me the cold treatment.

61
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,230
By the way, this bullet train just left the station,

62
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,030
so it'll be past 2:00 when we get there.

63
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,930
Won't your match be over by then?

64
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,530
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,530
The semi-finals don't start until 2 pm.

66
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,830
You'll make it in time for the finals.

67
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,330
Oh, okay.

68
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,130
So I'll be waiting to see you.

69
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,330
Kazuha?

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,830
What are you doing in there?

71
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,130
That's what I'd like to ask you!

72
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,630
This is the men's toilet, you know!

73
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,330
Really? I didn't notice that.

74
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,330
I thought it was a hiding place

75
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,530
for cowards who didn't want to compete.

76
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,930
I'm planning my moves.

77
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,530
So that I can beat that guy in the finals.

78
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,130
By that guy, are you talking about

79
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,030
that guy that looks just like Kudo?

80
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,530
That's right. Okita from Senshin High School in Kyoto.

81
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,030
Last year, he got me with jabs to the neck.

82
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,630
I'm going to pay him back for this scar behind my ear.

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,830
Just because he beat you before,

84
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,830
don't you think you're being kind of sneaky?

85
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,230
Don't be stupid! He didn't beat me.

86
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,730
I got cut on the neck when I dodged the jab,

87
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,030
and when it wouldn't stop bleeding,

88
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,830
the doctor stopped the match.

89
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,230
Besides, the guy skipped the first and second match,

90
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,230
he was sleeping behind the gym

91
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,930
and then he took me on.

92
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,630
You don't have to worry about him, you can beat him.

93
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,930
You brought your lucky charm, didn't you?

94
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,930
That's not the only reason

95
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,630
I skipped the first and second matches though.

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,330
The truth is, it's my right hand

97
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,230
remember what happened on Bikuni Island.

98
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,630
It's so itchy, it's driving me crazy!

99
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,630
I can't concentrate on the match!

100
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,230
Is that so? Fine then!

101
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,530
I'm going to have a talk with your mother.

102
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,330
And have her beat some heart and soul into you.

103
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,130
What? Mom's here?

104
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,130
Hey, Kazuha, wait!

105
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,830
What's the matter with you? You idiot!

106
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,130
-Idiot? -No, that wasn't me.

107
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,630
Did you say you can't compete because you have a hangover?

108
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,230
I couldn't help it.

109
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,330
The company that informally promised to hire me went bankrupt.

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,330
I was so floored. I had to have a drink.

111
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,630
You blockhead! You should have thought about the consequences!

112
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,230
Let's all settle down.

113
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,830
There's still over an hour left in the competition.

114
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,030
He's right.

115
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,630
Let's all calm down and come up with a plan.

116
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,330
You know, I could tell everybody about that.

117
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,630
What did you say?

118
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,830
Unlike the rest of you who all have jobs waiting,

119
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,630
I've got nothing to lose.

120
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,530
I don't know what you're talking about,

121
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,130
but if you don't want to compete,

122
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,130
then we'll just have to send in one of the seniors

123
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,330
although they aren't as good as you.

124
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,830
We can't have the whole team be embarrassed

125
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,330
just because of you.

126
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,330
For a guy who stole another guy's girlfriend, you sure talk big.

127
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,030
You're a fool. She made up her own mind to leave you.

128
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,330
I didn't steal her away.

129
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,030
Listen, I think you'd better sober up and start thinking about

130
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,230
how to get rid of that chip on your shoulder,

131
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,530
and what you're going to do with the rest of your life.

132
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,730
Kill...

133
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,230
I'm going to kill you.

134
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,530
What're you doing, Heiji? Come on, hurry!

135
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,230
Yeah, okay.

136
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,030
Chest jab, point!

137
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,030
Yes! Good move!

138
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,930
Hey, I can't find Tarumi anywhere.

139
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,330
Maybe he went home?

140
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,930
Good grief. You guys go look around there.

141
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,530
Okay.

142
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,630
Hey! Why aren't you paying attention to the match?

143
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,230
Go and score those points fast.

144
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,230
Make it to the best four!

145
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,730
"Annex" -Did you find him?

146
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,330
No, he wasn't in the toilet or the fencing hall.

147
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,530
Did you look in the storage room?

148
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,830
No, not yet.

149
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,330
But he wouldn't be here in the middle of the competition.

150
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,330
Ta... Tarumi?

151
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,130
How horrible!

152
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,130
Somebody, get an ambulance!

153
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,030
Okay, I'll go call for the ambulance!

154
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,030
Omotani, you go to the police box and get the police!

155
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,130
All right, then I'll go back to the gym

156
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,030
and tell Hakamata about this.

157
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,430
Okay! Go quick and bring him back here!

158
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,930
Okay!

159
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,030
Yahoo! We're in the best 4!

160
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,330
I think we can win the championship!

161
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,630
Tarumi's dead? Are you sure?

162
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,430
Pretty sure. I couldn't tell if he was breathing

163
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,830
but he was covered with blood!

164
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,330
Where is he?

165
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,930
Who the heck are you?

166
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,330
I asked you where he is!

167
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,430
What is this? There's nothing in here.

168
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,930
That's strange.

169
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,630
We found him here, leaning against this vaulting horse.

170
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,230
What kind of doll is this?

171
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,330
I think it's a doll you use to practice life saving techniques on.

172
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,130
You know, like mouth to mouth resuscitation.

173
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,730
Are you sure you didn't mistake this doll for your friend?

174
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,130
That's ridiculous!

175
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,830
Hey! Police is here!

176
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,730
The ambulance will be here in about 10 minutes.

177
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,830
Thing is, we can't find Tarumi.

178
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,230
What did you say?

179
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,230
You don't think Tarumi pulled a fast one on us, do you?

180
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,430
What?

181
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,430
Come on, let's split up and look for Tarumi!

182
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,230
If this is some kind of joke, I'm going to teach him a lesson!

183
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,930
Excuse me.

184
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,230
Are you from Shinnai University?

185
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,730
Yeah, that's right. What is it?

186
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,430
A call just came in to the reception desk from a strange man.

187
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,230
He said to tell the guys from Shinnai University

188
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,330
who are in the storage room now

189
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,830
to go to the locker room beside the pool.

190
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,430
It's got to be Tarumi!

191
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,830
That sneak! What a stinker!

192
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,530
Let's go and check it out.

193
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,030
"Shower room"

194
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,530
Ta... Tarumi!

195
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,530
Is this for real?

196
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,130
He's really dead.

197
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,130
I don't believe it.

198
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,870
The body in the storage room

199
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,570
is moved to the locker room beside the pool while no one is watching.

200
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,670
Dees that mean someone moved it?

201
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,170
But if you were carrying a body as bloody as that,

202
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,070
someone's bound to notice.

203
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,970
There's a team from some school

204
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,770
sitting around the doorway in the annex having their lunch.

205
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,670
Why go to such lengths?

206
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,670
Hey, Heiji!

207
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,470
What're you doing? You haven't even eaten your lunch!

208
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,170
There's less than an hour left before the semi-finals.

209
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,770
Shut up. I'm on a case!

210
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,370
There's been a murder in the locker room over there.

211
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,270
What? Are you serious?

212
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,970
But I don't understand something

213
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,770
so I can't concentrate on the match.

214
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,970
Then maybe you should ask Kudo for advice.

215
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,870
Are they coming here, aren't they?

216
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,170
That's right, Kudo! I'll just give him a call.

217
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,670
Kudo would be able to solve the case in no time.

218
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,870
You don't have to lose any sleep over it.

219
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,070
Let Kudo handle the investigation,

220
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,470
you get back to the match, come on!

221
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,870
Listen, Kazuha.

222
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,670
Don't you dare tell Kudo about the murder.

223
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,670
-What? -Don't forget what I said!

224
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,070
Heiji!

225
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,570
Kudo won't get here for another hour and a half.

226
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,970
I've got to solve this case by then!

227
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,570
You've got rice on yourself again.

228
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,570
What? Did you say murder?

229
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,070
Then you mean, Hattori's...

230
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,770
That's right. He said he doesn't have time to compete.

231
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,670
He's running around looking for clues.

232
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,270
What're we going to do?

233
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,670
The semi-finals are going to start already.

234
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,070
We don't have a choice.

235
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,370
We've got to take the championship without Heiji.

236
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,170
Then we'll break that darn mystery fool's nose in half!

237
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,770
Excuse me. We're the ones who're going to be in the match.

238
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,770
You're positive he's one of your team mates?

239
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,070
Yes, that's right.

240
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,870
His name's Tarumi. We're classmates at the same university.

241
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,670
The killer must have put him under the hot shower

242
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,270
to mask the time of death.

243
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,670
Well, it's plain to see

244
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,970
that the murder weapon is this sword.

245
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,170
As soon as we find out who it belongs to,

246
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,770
we'll have the killer...

247
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,370
You're wrong about that, Inspector Otaki.

248
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,670
The "fast draw" instructor brought it to the competition

249
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,070
because he was going to put on a demonstration using a real sword.

250
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,970
Somebody probably saw it left in the dressing room,

251
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,770
stole it and used it to commit the murder.

252
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,270
Heiji, what're you doing here?

253
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,470
Can't you tell by looking at me? I'm competing.

254
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,270
Oh, I remember now! Today's the day of the big competition

255
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,170
between Kinki's high school and college teams.

256
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,570
So do you have any idea who stole this sword?

257
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,770
Sort of.

258
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,970
The killer's somebody who comes to this competition a lot

259
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,870
and knows about the fast draw demonstration.

260
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,670
That person also knows the layout of the place,

261
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,970
the gym, the annex and the locker room.

262
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,970
Which means, the killer is somebody just like you guys.

263
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,070
I understand the part about having to know

264
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,370
about the demonstration and stealing the sword

265
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,770
but what does knowing about the gym and annex and locker room

266
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,970
have to do with anything?

267
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,670
Because if the killer didn't know the locations of these places,

268
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,370
it wouldn't be possible to move Mr. Tarumi

269
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,270
from the annex to this locker room without being seen.

270
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,570
What bothers me is, not why he was moved but how.

271
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,670
Because when it happened, there was a group of people

272
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,570
sitting in front of the annex eating their lunch.

273
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,570
It would've been impossible for them not to notice

274
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,770
a man covered with blood being carried out.

275
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,870
Unless of course,

276
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,470
after you guys found Mr. Tarumi in the storage room,

277
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,970
the last one to leave the place

278
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,070
very cleverly managed to carry him out.

279
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,370
Do you guys remember what happened?

280
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,670
The first one to leave was Kotegawa here.

281
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,170
He said he was going to call an ambulance.

282
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,470
Then I left.

283
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,770
Kotegawa told me to go to the police box and get the police.

284
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,170
So that means, Mr. Doguchi,

285
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,970
you were the last to leave, weren't you?

286
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,470
But I left right away to get Hakamata who was in the gym.

287
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,170
How do I know you're not lying?

288
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,270
I... I said I was going, didn't I?

289
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,770
Yeah.

290
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,670
Besides, Doguchi wasn't the last one to leave, it was me.

291
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,770
What?

292
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,070
I knew we needed the ambulance as soon as possible

293
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,270
so when I saw a group of high school students

294
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,670
hanging around the entrance,

295
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,770
I borrowed their cell phone.

296
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,470
But the person I was talking to

297
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,470
asked me to describe the injured person's condition

298
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,670
so I went back and described Tarumi's condition.

299
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,870
Of course, there was nobody else around.

300
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,370
As soon as I was finished,

301
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,070
I went back to return the cellphone

302
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,170
then I headed for the police box.

303
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,270
Is that the truth?

304
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,970
Yes, he came to the police box.

305
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,770
I'm not good at explaining things, so I was relieved he came.

306
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,970
And how long did it take to go from the annex

307
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,970
to the police box then back again?

308
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,670
There's a big intersection in front of the police box

309
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,370
and we got stuck at the light...

310
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,070
I think it took about 14 to 15 minutes.

311
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,070
Did you say 14 to 15 minutes?

312
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,170
Don't you think that's strange. Mr. Doguchi?

313
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,770
Mr. Omotani and Mr. Kotegawa

314
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,070
came back with the police right after we arrived.

315
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,470
The gym is right by the annex,

316
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,370
don't you think it took an unusually long time to get Mr. Hakamata?

317
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,770
He probably had a hard time finding me.

318
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,970
The place was filled with guys wearing the same kind of outfits.

319
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,070
This means, you also had some unaccounted time.

320
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,370
I don't care if you suspect us,

321
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,070
but can you tell me one thing first?

322
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,170
Explain how you can get Tarumi, who was in that condition,

323
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,670
out of the storage room in the annex

324
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,870
into the locker room without being seen?

325
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
Yeah, that's right!

326
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,770
If you can't explain that,

327
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,670
then you can't prove we're guilty!

328
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,870
Don't make up stories.

329
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,970
Well, Detective, we're going to see Tarumi's mother

330
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,470
and tell her what happened today.

331
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,870
Hakamata, you're the only one without a sash. Why's that?

332
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,970
I thought I brought it with me, but I guess I lost it.

333
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,270
Well, it looks like we're going to forfeit the match

334
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,970
so I guess I won't be needing it anyway.

335
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,670
Speaking of match, Heiji, how did you do today?

336
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,870
Did you win? Or did you lose?

337
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,970
Heiji?

338
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,070
Hit on the forearm, 1 point!

339
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,470
Way to go! We scored!

340
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,870
All we've got to do is hang in there until it's time

341
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,070
and then we're in the finals!

342
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,170
That's right!

343
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,370
We don't need Heiji to win the championship!

344
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,070
Thrust to the neck, 1 point!

345
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,570
4 to 1, the match goes to Kyoto Senshin High School!

346
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,770
Kyoto Senshin High School?

347
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,570
It's Okita, just like Heiji said.

348
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,370
This is not good!

349
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,270
Without Heiji, we don't stand a chance.

350
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,670
The windows behind the annex don't open

351
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,270
and the ones in the front are too noticeable.

352
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,170
The front door is only way.

353
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,870
But to carry him to the locker room beside the pool,

354
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,270
I'd have to pass the front of the gym

355
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,870
where there were a lot of people.

356
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,270
It's impossible.

357
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,570
Somebody's bound to notice a man covered with blood

358
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,970
being carried past them.

359
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,270
Gosh!

360
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,370
Kudo's going to be here in less than 10 minutes.

361
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,670
Hey, you! Wait up!

362
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,770
You just came out of the annex, didn't you?

363
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,170
What were you doing?

364
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,470
I only went to the toilet.

365
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,670
Sorry, but there's something I want to ask you.

366
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,370
What is it?

367
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,070
Before Mr. Tarumi was killed, I heard him say,

368
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,470
"You know, I could tell everybody about that".

369
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,370
What was that about?

370
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,470
How would I know? I don't know anything!

371
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,870
All right then, is the girl Mr. Tarumi and Mr. Hakamata

372
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,270
were fighting about here today?

373
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,170
Of course not!

374
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,470
After that incident, Haori quit managing the kendo team!

375
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,270
That incident? What do you mean?

376
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,170
Did you see Okita's thrust?

377
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,970
Yeah. You can kill somebody with that one.

378
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,470
Hey, come back!

379
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,370
Huh? That's the guy.

380
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,270
He's running again like he was when we were eating lunch.

381
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,470
What?

382
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,270
Where you guys eating lunch around the door to the annex?

383
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,970
Yeah, that was us.

384
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,170
There were three weird college students.

385
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,770
They asked to borrow a cell phone,

386
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,270
and then they brought the police and other people, it was a circus.

387
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,470
All right then, after those three left the annex,

388
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,570
did any suspicious person go in there?

389
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,970
Yeah, there was one guy!

390
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,270
You!

391
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,270
Dummy! Before me!

392
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,070
There was one suspicious guy that came out of the annex.

393
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,070
What?

394
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,870
He was carrying somebody else's gear in a bag.

395
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,970
How could you tell it wasn't his?

396
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,470
That was easy.

397
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,970
He was carrying the bag

398
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,270
while he was wearing his mask and protective gear.

399
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,470
So that's how he did it! A gear bag!

400
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,170
If you put the body in there and carried it out,

401
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,970
nobody would get suspicious.

402
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,370
Mr. Hakamata's the only one would could've done it.

403
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,270
He killed Mr. Tarumi beforehand

404
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,370
and hid the body in the storage room.

405
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,670
And while he has the others looking for Mr. Tarumi,

406
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,370
he goes back to the storage room

407
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,570
and after the other three find the body and go for help,

408
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,970
he puts Mr. Tarumi in the gear bag

409
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,370
and sneaks toward the locker room.

410
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,870
No, that's not possible.

411
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,370
Even if you were hiding in that storage room,

412
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,170
there's no guarantee somebody would look in there.

413
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,070
Besides, it was just coincidence

414
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,470
that all three of them left the storage room.

415
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,770
If someone decided to remain,

416
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,270
then he wouldn't be able to come out.

417
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,270
Hey!

418
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,570
You better watch yourself kid

419
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,770
or you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

420
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,870
I hear you've been asking about Haori too.

421
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,970
You already told him?

422
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,270
Of course he did!

423
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,670
Doguchi and me go way back.

424
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,170
Whenever he is in trouble, he always comes to tell me.

425
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,570
We made a pact when we were little kids.

426
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,670
You're way off course suspecting him though.

427
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,670
He's a coward. He can't stand the sight of blood.

428
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,470
What?

429
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,170
Listen carefully! Don't be a pest!

430
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,970
Hello?

431
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,570
Hattori, it's me.

432
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,170
Kudo, it's you.

433
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,170
Where are you? On the bus?

434
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,770
No. Pops didn't want to wait for the bus

435
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,670
so we got on a cab.

436
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,970
All right, take your time!

437
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,070
In fact, why don't you get off and have a bowl of noodles?

438
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,170
Maybe even walk around and do some sightseeing.

439
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,170
Don't be stupid. We already told the driver where to go.

440
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,870
We're on our way there.

441
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,870
What?

442
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,070
By the way, you're in the finals, aren't you?

443
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,670
Hey, Hattori. You there?

444
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,370
Hey, guys.

445
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,370
Do you know about the life saving dolls in the storage room?

446
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,570
Sure, because we came here a lot to practice.

447
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,870
How many dolls do they have in there?

448
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,270
Two. One skinny one and one big one.

449
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,870
That's it!

450
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,070
Isn't he Hattori from Kaiho High?

451
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,070
What's he doing here? The finals are starting already.

452
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,970
If my theory's right, it should be here.

453
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,570
It should still be here in this storage room.

454
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,870
I knew it!

455
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,370
This is what the killer used to move the body.

456
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,170
Heiji! Heiji, where are you?

457
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,970
That fool! Where the heck is he?

458
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,570
Kazuha!

459
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,070
We're here to root for Heiji!

460
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,970
Ran!

461
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,270
Is Hattori's team in the finals'?

462
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,270
Yes! And it's starting soon

463
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,970
-but Heiji's gone off somewhere. -What?

464
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,570
I just know he's running around

465
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,370
trying to solve the murder that just happened.

466
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,270
Murder?

467
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,550
The question is,

468
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,150
who the killer is and how Mr. Tarumi was moved.

469
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,850
We know how.

470
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,450
One of my men just questioned some of the kids

471
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,850
that were hanging around the entrance to the annex

472
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,050
and it seems they saw the killer.

473
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,650
A suspicious character came out of here

474
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,750
wearing a mask and protective gear carrying a gear bag.

475
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,950
A mask, protective gear and a gear bag?

476
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,750
I see! The killer put Mr. Tarumi inside the gear bag

477
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,050
and wore a mask to cover his face

478
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,550
so no one would recognize him when he walked out.

479
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,350
When did that guy wearing the mask come out?

480
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,650
It seems it was after the three

481
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,150
left the annex after finding the body.

482
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,450
So it means that the person who moved the body

483
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,650
was not one of the three who found it.

484
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,650
That's right.

485
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,150
The killer was probably hiding in the storage room

486
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,150
when the three came in and found Mr. Tarumi's body.

487
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,650
He didn't think the body would be found so soon,

488
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,650
so he moved it here.

489
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,550
Excuse me, Inspector Otaki.

490
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,850
Did Heiji come here?

491
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,650
Yes, he was here for awhile

492
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,150
but he rushed off for someplace.

493
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,850
It's no use.

494
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,050
No matter what you do,

495
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,550
you can't make it look like Mr. Tarumi

496
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,050
was killed in this storage room.

497
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,950
Mr. Kotegawa.

498
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,650
That's right. This isn't where Mr. Tarumi was killed.

499
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,150
He was killed in the locker room beside the pool.

500
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,350
After you fellows found Mr. Tarumi's body,

501
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,150
Mr. Omotani and Mr. Doguchi left.

502
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,250
You alone came back

503
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,650
and told him to go to the locker room,

504
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,650
that's where you killed him.

505
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,050
Isn't that right?

506
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,250
How stupid.

507
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,250
It was pure coincidence that they left the storage room.

508
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,650
If someone had stayed behind,

509
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,650
I wouldn't have been able to come back

510
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,150
and do what you claim I did, now would I?

511
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,350
No, it was no coincidence.

512
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,850
All you had to do was tell Mr. Omotani to go get the police

513
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,450
to guarantee no one would be left.

514
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,950
You knew Mr. Doguchi's personality.

515
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,150
Whenever something happened,

516
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,850
he always reported it to Mr. Hakamata.

517
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,450
Besides, he can't stand the sight of blood.

518
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,650
You knew he wouldn't touch the body,

519
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,350
that he'd immediately go to find Mr. Hakamata.

520
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,850
You gave Mr. Tarumi liquor laced with sleep inducers

521
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,250
then you put red paint on him to make him appear dead,

522
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,550
so no one would think he was alive.

523
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,750
This storage room is dark,

524
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,050
so the red paint would look like real blood.

525
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,850
There were a lot of people in front of the annex.

526
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,750
If somebody covered with red paint came out of here,

527
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,150
don't you think someone was bound to notice?

528
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,950
Yes, they did.

529
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,350
They saw a suspicious character wearing a mask

530
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,150
and protective gear come out of the annex carrying a gear bag.

531
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,550
Come on, I hope you're not saying that that was Tarumi?

532
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,450
What makes you think he'd dress himself up like that

533
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,050
to go to the locker room just because I told him to?

534
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,850
It wasn't just what you said.

535
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,550
If you were shown something like this while you were groggy,

536
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,550
you could be talked into doing anything.

537
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,650
He said "I'm going to kill you"?

538
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,550
Mr. Tarumi was always saying that?

539
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,150
Yes. It seems he had a grudge against Mr. Hakamata,

540
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,150
the other team members told me that.

541
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,950
So that means there's a possibility

542
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,350
Mr. Hakamata killed Mr. Tarumi instead.

543
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,550
No, that's wrong.

544
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,450
The killer probably took advantage of Mr. Tarumi's anger.

545
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,850
That's right. When you came back here alone,

546
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,250
you put the Japanese sword in Mr. Tarumi's hand.

547
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,650
Woke him up and showed him

548
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,850
the doll you'd hidden inside the vaulting horse beforehand.

549
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,850
Then you probably said this to him.

550
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,850
"What in the world have you done?"

551
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,350
Mr. Tarumi hated Mr. Hakamata

552
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,150
and he was still in a groggy state of mind.

553
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,950
So he didn't notice that it was just the doll

554
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,850
used to teach life saving techniques

555
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,650
wearing Mr. Hakamata's uniform.

556
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,850
That's why he thought the red paint on his chest guard

557
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,650
was Mr. Hakamata's blood

558
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,450
and that he'd killed him while he was drunk.

559
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,550
That's when you probably told him

560
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,550
that you'd let him get away

561
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,350
before the police arrived so he should put the mask on

562
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,050
and sneak into the locker room beside the pool and hide there.

563
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,450
And you also suggested he change out of his bloody clothes,

564
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,750
put on the protective gear

565
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,650
and put the sword into the bag for the bamboo sword.

566
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,150
Then told him to take them with him, didn't you?

567
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,150
You put the extra clothes and protective gear in the gear bag

568
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,950
and had it hidden it in the storage room.

569
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,150
That's so it would appear like someone else besides you

570
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,450
carried the body out of the storage room wearing a mask.

571
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,550
Then you took a shortcut to the locker room

572
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,050
and waited for Mr. Tarumi to arrive

573
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,150
and then you killed him for real.

574
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,450
After that, you washed the paint off of his body in the shower,

575
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,850
put the mask and protective gear in the gear bag.

576
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,650
And after you hid them somewhere,

577
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,050
you went to the police box where you'd sent Mr. Omotani.

578
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,350
That's when you did it, right?

579
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,050
That's when you got Mr. Tarumi's blood

580
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,550
on the towel you're holding now.

581
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,450
When you went to get the doll from inside the vaulting horse,

582
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,650
you decided to smear his blood on it

583
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,050
so that it'd look like he really was killed here, right?

584
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,850
That bloody towel in your hand

585
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,150
proves that you killed him!

586
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,250
If you know so much,

587
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,250
then you probably know why I did it.

588
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,050
Yes. I called the college you go to and checked up on you.

589
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,050
I found out that last year,

590
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,550
one of the new members of your kendo team

591
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,850
lost consciousness during practice and died.

592
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,150
The college claimed it was an accident,

593
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,450
but the truth is...

594
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,550
That's right. We were initiating the new members,

595
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,950
Tarumi didn't know his own strength, he overdid it.

596
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,350
Hakamata was officiator, but he was absent that day.

597
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,150
This is what Tarumi said.

598
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,750
"Sure I'm the one who did it

599
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,250
but everyone present here today and the manager is just as guilty.

600
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,550
If anyone talks, I'm taking everybody down with me."

601
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,950
So you decided to shut him up

602
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,550
so he couldn't ruin it for all of you

603
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,550
since you've got your new career.

604
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,850
I guess you know everything,

605
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,150
but seeing as you aren't armed,

606
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,450
you didn't know about this, did you?

607
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,750
The fast draw demonstrator had a partner.

608
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,550
Naturally, when I went into

609
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,650
the demonstrator's dressing room to steal the sword,

610
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,150
I'd already...

611
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,350
taken a few practice swings with it!

612
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,050
Huh?

613
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,650
A strange man called and told you come to the locker room?

614
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,150
Really?

615
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,250
Yes. When they all arrived,

616
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,750
they found Mr. Tarumi had been moved here.

617
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,050
The reason the killer called to give Mr. Tarumi's location was

618
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,850
he didn't want the storage room to be searched.

619
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,750
Which means, there's something he doesn't want found still inside.

620
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,850
Hey. Where is the storage room?

621
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,650
It's in the annex next to the gym. Why?

622
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,750
-Show me! -Wait, slow down!

623
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,350
Conan, where are you going?

624
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,550
Don't be a fool!

625
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,250
You won't be able to get away with it this time

626
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,050
if you kill me here!

627
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,950
I'm not worried.

628
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,550
The police will assume it's the same killer

629
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,950
and since they've already decided

630
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,650
I couldn't have moved Tarumi's body,

631
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,450
they won't even suspect me.

632
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,350
I've already figured everything out!

633
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,950
You picked the wrong guy to fight with.

634
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,150
What the?

635
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,550
Hattori?

636
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,150
Don't tell me...

637
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,050
you're that high school kid that shocked everybody

638
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,550
by beating the entire Osaka Police Department's team,

639
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,750
and they're all well trained.

640
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,050
That's right, but you realized it too late.

641
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,750
Yuranosuke!

642
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,750
Yo! Good to see you!

643
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,650
Heiji?

644
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,750
Well, Otaki, I'll let you take it from here.

645
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,650
You can count on me. Best of luck to you too, Heiji.

646
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,250
I almost forgot! The match!

647
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,250
We can't waste our time standing around here!

648
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,050
Are you okay?

649
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,150
Oh, no. I think it's already over.

650
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,450
Well, it couldn't be helped.

651
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,650
We lost the championship but solved the case.

652
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,050
Right?

653
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,350
Huh?

654
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,650
When's Heiji's turn?

655
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,250
This is delicious!

656
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,250
It's the best!

657
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,750
Of course it is.

658
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,450
No one makes better "tetchiri" than my mom.

659
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,050
Look at her. She fell asleep without taking a single bite.

660
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,650
It's all your fault!

661
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,050
She was running all over the place looking for you!

662
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,550
Well, it couldn't be helped.

663
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,050
I had to solve that murder, didn't I?

664
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,950
You can tell he's the son of the Chief of Police.

665
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,050
He solved the case in no time.

666
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,350
Thank you.

667
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,250
This kid solves cases purely on intuition.

668
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,150
He's just playing detective.

669
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,650
He doesn't even come close

670
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,650
to being a real detective like you, Mr. Mouri.

671
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,450
So what's that supposed to mean?

672
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,750
That Kudo's better than me too?

673
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,750
But Heizo, he's just like how you used to be

674
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,150
when you where his age.

675
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,250
I hate to see what he'll be like when he's older.

676
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,550
Hey, Toyama. Lay off the liquor.

677
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,350
You're driving, aren't you?

678
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,750
Don't worry. I'm going to let you drive me home.

679
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,750
What did you want to talk about?

680
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,050
Isn't that why you wanted me to drive you home?

681
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,350
Yeah.

682
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,850
It's about Heiji and my daughter Kazuha.

683
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,250
What do you think about their relationship?

684
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,850
Kazuha's already 17.

685
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,150
She'll be leaving for college soon.

686
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,650
And when she comes back, she'll be 20.

687
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:22,050
Some good for nothing's going to take her away from me one day anyway

688
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,150
so I figured it might as well be that no account son of yours.

689
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,550
Toyama, get to the point.

690
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,850
You still can't take a joke, can you?

691
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,950
So you were just kidding?

692
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,850
Do you remember what happened at Osaka Castle 13 years ago?

693
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,250
You mean the unidentified burnt body found in the inner moat?

694
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,050
This piece of pottery the victim had

695
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,450
hidden in his pocket.

696
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,650
That piece of pottery used to be

697
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,650
the main topic of our conversation back then.

698
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,950
We made up a lot of stories.

699
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,150
Well, turns out maybe they weren't just stories.

700
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,650
We found another piece.

701
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,650
It was on the burnt body we found in the east moat not too long ago.

702
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,450
It looks just like this one.

703
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,850
The lab is checking it out

704
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,750
but they're almost certain it was made in the same period.

705
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,250
Another thing. On the piece we just found,

706
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,250
you can make out the word "848" on it.

707
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,550
Things could turn out like we figured 13 years ago.

708
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,250
It could still be lying around somewhere.

709
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,450
Yeah. The huge fortune that great man left.

710
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,030
That round one's Osaka Hall.

711
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,030
And Osaka Business Park's over there

712
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,030
where all those buildings are.

713
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,530
And you can't see it from here because it's behind the building

714
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,230
but Osaka's most exciting television station is behind it!

715
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,030
And there's the city's symbol, Osaka Castle.

716
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,730
So? Now you know how great Osaka is!

717
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,930
That's the same thing you said

718
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,730
that last time we took them around.

719
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,630
-What? -Besides, we showed them

720
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,030
the view of the city from up high from Tsutenkaku last time.

721
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,030
I shouldn't have let you be tour guide.

722
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,030
I know, but the Tenjin Festival and the Gion Festival

723
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,330
and even the Danjiri Festival in Kishiwada are all over,

724
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,430
only Osaka Castle was left.

725
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,730
So if it was up to you, where'd you take us?

726
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,930
Let's see. If it was me,

727
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,330
it's right in front of this castle.

728
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,730
I'd give you the grand tour of Osaka's police headquarters.

729
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,230
And I'd take you inside the new building

730
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,230
which is almost finished.

731
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,930
That is so stupid.

732
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,730
You're the only one who'd enjoy something like that.

733
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,030
That sounds like fun.

734
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,630
Osaka Castle is much prettier

735
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,730
than when you see it on television or in pictures.

736
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,030
You noticed? They've just finished repairing it,

737
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,630
so it's been cleaned up nice.

738
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,030
They hadn't done any work on it

739
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,530
since they restored the tower about 60 years ago.

740
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,530
It was 70 years ago.

741
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,030
Huh?

742
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,130
Hideyoshi Toyotomi first built it in 1599.

743
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:26,030
Tokugawa rebuilt it in 1629.

744
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,630
And the people of Osaka restored it 70 years ago, in 1931,

745
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,630
this is the third tower.

746
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,930
You sure know your stuff.

747
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:43,030
Of course I do. Hideyoshi Toyotomi's my hero.

748
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,430
So you say, but that badge you've got on

749
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,830
looks like the Tokugawa crest, the 3 leafed mallow.

750
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,730
Well, you see it's like this.

751
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,030
Hey, Ieyasu. What're you doing?

752
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,830
The Lord is waiting.

753
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,330
Sorry, Mitsuhide.

754
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,030
-Ieyasu? -Mitsuhide?

755
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,230
Lord?

756
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,830
"8 days research tour of Hideyoshi Toyotomi"?

757
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,330
That's right. That's the name of our tour.

758
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,930
All the tour members are Hideyoshi fans,

759
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,730
we got together through the internet.

760
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,730
We went from Nagoya to Kyoto visiting places he's known for

761
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,830
and now we're in Osaka.

762
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,730
So what about the names you call each other and those badges?

763
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,430
It's sort of like a penalty in a game.

764
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,730
Every day, after breakfast,

765
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,830
we draw lots to decide which roles we'll be playing

766
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,630
and we put the badges on

767
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:39,530
with the crests of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, Ieyasu and Mitsuhide.

768
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,130
And for the entire day,

769
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,030
whoever picks Hideyoshi, Ieyasu and Mitsuhide

770
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,430
has to play the role

771
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,530
and cater to whoever Nobunaga is.

772
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,630
For instance, we take souvenir pictures of that person

773
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,630
or go run errands, things like that.

774
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,430
On the other hand...

775
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,630
Nobunaga has to give Hideyoshi and Ieyasu

776
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,430
money for dinner.

777
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,530
-Isn't that right? -Yes, that's right, Nene.

778
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,730
You mean you have someone playing "Nene", too?

779
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,430
That's right. Whoever picks the blank lot has to be "Nene".

780
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,530
That person has to watch everyone else

781
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,530
and pass things off with a smile.

782
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,630
But I feel sorry for whoever has to be Mitsuhide.

783
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,630
He has to pay for his own dinner

784
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,830
even though he works hard all day, right?

785
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,330
But playing Mitsuhide also has its rewards.

786
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,730
He gets to play Nobunaga for 3 minutes

787
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,730
and he gets to pick the time.

788
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,330
I see. Rather than Lord for 3 days,

789
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,430
it's Lord for 3 minutes.

790
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,830
Sounds stupid.

791
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,630
It sounds like fun.

792
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,330
It is.

793
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,830
So this is where everybody is.

794
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,930
I couldn't find you, so I'd been looking all over the place.

795
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,430
Lord Nobunaga, please forgive us.

796
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,030
Here is the oolong tea you requested.

797
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,630
And this is the post card of Osaka Castle.

798
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,930
Thank you. That was very thoughtful of you.

799
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,930
He's a very humble Nobunaga.

800
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,730
Something's not right though.

801
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,730
The main character Hideyoshi is missing.

802
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,830
That's right. I thought he was with you.

803
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,630
He was with me until just a little while ago,

804
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,730
but then he got a call on his cellular

805
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,030
and he ran off somewhere.

806
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,130
Do you know where he went to?

807
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,730
No. But he did say we were to have lunch without him.

808
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,530
Then he must have gone off to have lunch on his own.

809
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,030
Come on, don't bother with them.

810
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,130
They're kind of strange.

811
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,730
Why don't we go get some lunch too?

812
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,230
Finally! I can finally take a look at it.

813
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,330
I gave up 13 years ago,

814
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,730
but this radiant treasure's finally in my hands.

815
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:52,130
"Dragon"

816
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,130
How can you be so dumb?

817
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,730
We have to go back to Osaka Castle again.

818
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,930
Besides, how can you lose your wallet

819
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,230
when you put it in your bag?

820
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,630
You kept saying "Hurry up, hurry up"

821
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,830
so I must have left it somewhere.

822
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,930
How much did you have inside?

823
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,330
5,000 yen.

824
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,630
Just forget about it then. Besides, it's getting dark already.

825
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,030
No! I have my favorite amulet inside it!

826
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,330
It's nothing to cry about!

827
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,230
I'm not crying.

828
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,230
It's raining.

829
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,230
It doesn't look like it's going to let up so soon.

830
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,730
Here, I have an umbrella.

831
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,930
-This is the pits. -What'll we do?

832
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:42,530
Hey, maybe you left your wallet in that store.

833
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,530
Remember? Kazuha, you bought a disposable camera there.

834
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,130
I think you're right.

835
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,030
All right then, we'll go and ask.

836
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,130
Gosh.

837
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,130
I think we should look over there.

838
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,030
We already did.

839
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,230
Is something wrong?

840
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:06,630
Yes. We can't find our friend who's playing Hideyoshi.

841
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,630
We looked for him at Osaka Castle and the shops around here,

842
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,930
even in the toilets...

843
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,930
He's nowhere to be found.

844
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,930
I wonder where he could've gone.

845
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,630
What's that?

846
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,330
Look! What's that?

847
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,330
Somebody's burning!

848
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,430
Mr. Mouri, call for an ambulance!

849
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,030
Okay!

850
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,930
Hey, can you hear me? What happened to you?

851
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,930
Huh?

852
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,230
Hey, hang in there! You hear me?

853
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,640
Yes! That's it! This is my wallet!

854
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,040
You're very lucky.

855
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,740
I figured you might be coming back right away

856
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,740
so I kept it here instead of giving it to the police.

857
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,540
It's a very precious wallet, isn't it?

858
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,440
It was filled with amulets.

859
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,640
It sure is! Thank you so much, madam!

860
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,840
You mean you had more than one amulet in there?

861
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,240
I bought a charm to chase away evil, too.

862
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,940
So that we wouldn't be involved in another case

863
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,840
and have it ruin your visit to Osaka like last time.

864
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,940
How sweet!

865
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,640
What? A burning man fell from the tower?

866
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,740
Are you sure about that?

867
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,540
Yeah. The police are there and everything's going crazy!

868
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,640
It didn't work, none of them.

869
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
I guess not.

870
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,940
Inspector Otaki, you sure are busy.

871
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,540
Two murders two days straight.

872
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,740
Well, it's my job.

873
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,840
It's amazing though.

874
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,040
How did you know the victim's name was Yuji Kato?

875
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,740
I looked on his badge.

876
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,240
His badge?

877
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,540
You mean the crest on his chest?

878
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,340
That's Hideyoshi's crest, the Goshichi paulownia.

879
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,840
As soon as I saw it,

880
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,240
I knew he was the Hideyoshi character from their group

881
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,040
so I had them come and identify the body.

882
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,040
What do you mean about Hideyoshi character?

883
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,940
As part of the tours entertainment,

884
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,440
we have each member act as

885
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,240
a famous person from the Warring States period

886
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,140
and also have a penalty game.

887
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,240
For instance, I'm Mitsuhide and Kasuya is Ieyasu.

888
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,140
Wakisaka is Nobunaga and Katagiri is Nene.

889
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,040
And Kato over there was Hideyoshi.

890
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,040
I see. That sure sounds like a lot of fun.

891
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,840
But I don't understand how you could lose track of

892
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,640
one of your tour members and let him end up like this.

893
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,940
Well...

894
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,240
He disappeared so suddenly

895
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,640
and we were looking for him all this time.

896
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,140
He was wearing a flashy fleece outfit

897
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,540
so we figured we could spot him right away.

898
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,740
Who'd have thought he'd fall from there in a ball of fire.

899
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,440
By the way, can you think of a reason

900
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,040
why Mr. Kato would commit suicide?

901
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,840
No. I don't have the slightest idea.

902
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,640
How do you know it was suicide?

903
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,740
First off, it's raining so hard.

904
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,840
No one would go out there on the roof.

905
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,340
And then, he was wearing clothes made of fleece,

906
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,840
which is very flammable.

907
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,740
That proves he went out on the roof himself

908
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,140
and set himself on fire.

909
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,340
But you sure do come across a lot of murders, don't you?

910
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,140
Maybe you're cursed or something?

911
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,240
Not really.

912
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,940
The Chief of Police's son comes across them more often.

913
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,640
What? Is Heiji here, too?

914
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,240
Yes. He and Conan went inside the castle just a little while ago.

915
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Hey, Kudo.

916
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,440
Be careful, it's slippery up there because of the rain.

917
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,040
How embarrassing. I feel like a trained monkey.

918
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,040
Did you find something?

919
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,040
There's a lot of teeny tiny pieces of something up here.

920
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,140
It's a lighter.

921
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,740
Could this be the lighter he used?

922
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,440
It doesn't make sense though. Why is it here?

923
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,140
What's this mark?

924
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,740
I just don't believe it.

925
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,140
Why would Kato commit suicide?

926
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
I don't believe it either.

927
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,540
He was really looking forward to coming to Osaka.

928
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,240
I guess you never know what people are really thinking about.

929
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,840
Maybe he'd planned all along

930
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,640
to commit suicide here in the land of Hideyoshi Toyotomu.

931
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,840
All we have to do is find what he used to set himself on fire with.

932
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,940
Right. That's all we need to find.

933
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,440
We found it!

934
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,940
It was on the roof of the tower. It's a lighter.

935
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,540
Why isn't that the lighter Kato had?

936
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,640
Yes, I think it is.

937
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,840
That settles it! It was a suicide!

938
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,540
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

939
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,540
What?

940
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,040
The cover on this lighter was closed.

941
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,540
Do you think someone committing suicide

942
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,440
would take the time to close the cover?

943
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,340
But Heiji, maybe the cover closed when he dropped it.

944
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,440
If that were the case,

945
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,540
we should have found it further down the roof.

946
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,640
Besides, it looked like something else was there

947
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,240
before the lighter was put down.

948
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,140
What do you mean, something else?

949
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,240
When we found the lighter,

950
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,440
there was a dry spot in a strange shape under it.

951
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,640
Not a rectangle shape like this lighter,

952
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
it was a nice fan shape.

953
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,640
I'm pretty sure something round was put there

954
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,140
before it started to rain.

955
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,440
After the rain started,

956
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,140
that round thing was replaced with the lighter.

957
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,240
-Isn't that right, kid? -Yes.

958
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,540
But Heiji, what do you think that round thing was?

959
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,540
Beats me. I haven't figured that out yet.

960
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,540
But I think it has something to do

961
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,840
with the little chips all over the place.

962
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,140
Inspector Otaki.

963
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,840
We've laid out all of the victim's personal belongings out.

964
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,040
Wallet, watch, cellular phone,

965
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,040
keys, cigarettes and a piece of something.

966
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,240
Huh? A scroll.

967
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,740
What is this?

968
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,440
Only the word "dragon" is on this thing.

969
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
And what is this from?

970
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,640
It looks like piece of pottery.

971
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,240
Huh? That piece...

972
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,540
Isn't it possible that piece is the same

973
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,540
as the ones they found on the other burned bodies?

974
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:44,040
My dad and your father were talking about it in the car last night.

975
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,140
One was found in the inner moat 13 years ago

976
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,840
and the other was found just recently in the outer moat.

977
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,140
Both victims had pieces of pottery that looked the same.

978
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,840
And I heard them say that

979
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,340
the one they found recently had "848" written on it.

980
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,440
848? What does that mean?

981
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,540
No one was really sure

982
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,040
but it seems that those pieces are a part of some kind of treasure.

983
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,640
Treasure?

984
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,940
I'm not making it up!

985
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,140
They were whispering like it was a secret!

986
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,740
They said something about huge fortune the great man left behind.

987
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,940
Did you say huge fortune?

988
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,340
Are you sure you're not making all of this up?

989
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,640
Hey, Hattori.

990
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,640
Look at this piece of pottery.

991
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,840
There's shiny stuff stuck on the inside of it.

992
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,940
Hey. Isn't that gold?

993
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,840
I think so, but it's not much

994
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,440
so I don't think it's much of a treasure.

995
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,740
Gosh. I just don't understand this case.

996
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,440
It's a mysterious enough that Mr. Kato left the tour

997
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,440
and went up the roof

998
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,040
but it's even harder to explain why he suddenly burst into flames.

999
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,140
And the biggest question...

1000
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,740
Why Mr. Kato grabbed the umbrella...

1001
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,640
just before he died.

1002
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,840
Umbrella could refer to rain.

1003
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,340
And rain makes me think of

1004
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,640
the Ryuko rock right here at Osaka Castle.

1005
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,940
What's that?

1006
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,540
You mean you don't know?

1007
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,440
Here at Osaka Castle,

1008
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,540
standing on both sides of the Sakura Gate, protecting the tower

1009
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,940
we have rocks called Ryuko Rocks.

1010
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,140
That's what they've been called since long ago

1011
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,040
because it's said that when it rains,

1012
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,740
the figures of a dragon and tiger appear on them.

1013
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,240
Rain.

1014
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,440
Let me borrow that for awhile!

1015
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,840
-What's going on? -That's evidence!

1016
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,540
Her story might just be true.

1017
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,540
Yeah.

1018
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,040
There's still a possibility it could be hidden somewhere.

1019
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,540
The treasure of Hideyoshi, the man called "Lord of Gold"...

1020
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,440
It's somewhere in Osaka Castle.

1021
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,940
Which means, Hideyoshi's treasure...

1022
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,340
Yeah, it's me.

1023
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,640
Don't make a move yet.

1024
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,340
It doesn't look like the cops will be leaving soon.

1025
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,740
Don't worry about it.

1026
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,940
The thing we want is right in front of me.

1027
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,140
Make sure you've got everything ready.

1028
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:34,220
What? You know what the treasure Hideyoshi left is?

1029
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,820
Are you sure?

1030
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,820
Yes, I'm pretty sure about it.

1031
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,220
The clue is the piece of pottery Mr. Kato had.

1032
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,220
Take a good look at it.

1033
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,520
There's just a little bit here and there,

1034
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,620
but you can see that there's gold stuck on the inside.

1035
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,020
You're right.

1036
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,720
But how do you knew there's a lot of treasure

1037
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,620
just by looking at this piece?

1038
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,720
Now, put it together with this scroll that Mr. Kato had

1039
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,820
and look again carefully.

1040
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,320
But this scroll only has the word, "dragon"

1041
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,520
on the upper right hand written on it.

1042
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,320
What is this?

1043
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,520
Several sheets of paper

1044
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,920
were pasted over the word that was written there.

1045
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,220
It's just like the Ryuko Rocks at Osaka Castle,

1046
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,720
when you wet the paper, the word underneath appears.

1047
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,620
But most of the words have been burnt

1048
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,820
and you can't read them.

1049
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,720
And what about this? What's this drawing on the left?

1050
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,720
Isn't that a gourd?

1051
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,720
The gourd is the symbol on Hideyoshi's flag. It's his standard.

1052
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,820
-What? -So, is that mean

1053
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,620
that piece might have come from pottery shaped like a gourd?

1054
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,020
And are you saying that it was filled with gold?

1055
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,920
But according to this diagram,

1056
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,120
it was about one shaku high,

1057
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,120
which is only about 30 centimeters.

1058
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,620
No matter how much money you stuffed in it,

1059
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,020
it's so small, it wouldn't add up to much.

1060
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,820
Did you forget?

1061
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,920
It's been said that whenever General Hideyoshi won a battle,

1062
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,120
he added a small gourd

1063
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,920
and that's how his golden standard was created.

1064
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,120
The bottle gourds!

1065
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,020
Bottle gourds, you mean?

1066
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,520
Don't tell me...

1067
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,320
That's right. If there were 1,000 of the same thing,

1068
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,120
that would be some treasure!

1069
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,520
And if you were to consider the history behind it,

1070
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,020
it would be priceless.

1071
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,920
The burnt body 13 years ago had a piece,

1072
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,620
so did the other recent body

1073
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,020
and now Mr. Kato, it could mean that

1074
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,620
maybe they were after the treasure

1075
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:29,120
but they were killed by someone who wanted it all for themselves.

1076
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,020
I don't understand though.

1077
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,620
How did the Chief of Police and your father know

1078
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,520
that it meant a huge treasure just by looking at the two pieces?

1079
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,220
They hadn't seen the scroll yet.

1080
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,220
They probably knew by looking at the shape.

1081
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,920
The piece my father was looking at in the car

1082
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,320
looked like it came from the top of the gourd

1083
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,920
and he said the words "848" was written on it.

1084
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,820
I get it. 848 is a number between 1 and 1,000.

1085
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:03,220
If both of the pieces had gold stuck to them on the inside,

1086
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,220
that theory might be correct.

1087
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,020
But that sounds like a fairy tale.

1088
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,920
But it isn't entirely impossible.

1089
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,520
It's been said that even after Hideyoshi died,

1090
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,220
Ieyasu was intimidated by him

1091
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,420
because of all the gold and silver he'd stored in Osaka Castle.

1092
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,020
There's a legend that when Hideyoshi wanted

1093
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,620
to purify the water in the well,

1094
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,020
he put a huge amount of gold in the Kinmeisui

1095
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,020
directly in front of the tower.

1096
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,520
Even if that's true,

1097
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,020
what makes you think this is refers to hidden treasure?

1098
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,620
For all you know, this scroll could just be a blueprint.

1099
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,720
Stupid. Hiding gold in pottery

1100
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,620
and layering sheets of paper over the scroll

1101
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,720
is the proof someone deliberately wanted to hide something.

1102
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,020
That scroll's the dragons chapter.

1103
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,720
Which means, it's so obvious...

1104
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,320
About the tiger.

1105
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,720
If that scroll with the dragon is like the Ryuko Rock

1106
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,020
and the drawing of a gourd appeared when it got wet,

1107
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,920
then there should be a scroll with a tiger somewhere too.

1108
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,320
And what's more,

1109
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,420
there's two high possibility that scroll will show us

1110
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,120
where the gourds are hidden.

1111
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,820
Isn't that right, Heiji?

1112
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,720
Mr. Toyama!

1113
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,520
What brings you here?

1114
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,320
I gave him a call.

1115
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,420
The prefectural police's main headquarters is fight over there.

1116
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,420
Huh?

1117
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,820
It seemed to be linked to a case dad was involved in before.

1118
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,820
Besides, if I didn't do something like this,

1119
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,120
you'd never tear yourself away from this place, would you?

1120
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,720
She's gone and butted in again.

1121
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,020
Kazuha's right. Let us take care of this.

1122
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,620
Yes, listen to him.

1123
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,620
I know a real nice place in the Shimbashi direction of Osaka Castle.

1124
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,520
Let's have dinner there!

1125
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,220
Be quiet! Someone died right in front of our eyes!

1126
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,220
How can you stuff your face...

1127
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,120
I mean, have dinner. It wouldn't feel right, would it?

1128
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,420
So, you should just forget about me

1129
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,320
and have dinner with Ran. I won't mind, Kazuha.

1130
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,820
Forget you, then!

1131
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,120
Let's go, Ran! We'll just go without them!

1132
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,620
Wait a minute, Kazuha!

1133
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,120
Come on, let's go!

1134
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,720
It's a super delicious Italian restaurant!

1135
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,120
Excuse me, would it be all right if we got something to eat too?

1136
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,320
We haven't had anything to eat since lunch.

1137
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,920
My clothes got wet from the rain

1138
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,720
so I'm going to the hotel first and change.

1139
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,320
-Wait! -We'll be right back.

1140
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,820
The hotel we're staying in is close by.

1141
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,320
All right then, but don't be long!

1142
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,520
That voice... Could it be...

1143
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,120
-Hey, Otaki. -Yes, sir!

1144
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,420
Listen.

1145
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,120
Yes, sir. I'll tell my men right away.

1146
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,620
-Be careful. -Yes, sir!

1147
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,220
Heizo, it's me.

1148
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,020
You did it for Heiji, didn't you?

1149
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,320
Calling your father like that.

1150
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,620
You knew your father was deeply involved in that case

1151
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,120
so you figured if you called him in

1152
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,520
he'd fill Heiji in with all the information he'd be dying to know.

1153
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,720
But you didn't want him to catch on

1154
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,020
so you used that tone with him.

1155
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,320
So, what if I did? I love seeing it.

1156
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
I love seeing how his face glows

1157
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,820
whenever he solves a case.

1158
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,920
I'm such a fool, aren't I?

1159
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,820
Yes, a major fool!

1160
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,420
A major fool?

1161
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,320
And so am I.

1162
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,620
It's so frustrating,

1163
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,920
but there's something so wonderful about Shinichi

1164
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,020
when he gets like that.

1165
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,920
But only when he gets like that though.

1166
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,520
Isn't that right, Conan? You agree, don't you?

1167
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,520
Oh, no! I forgot to bring Conan along!

1168
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,220
You're right.

1169
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,020
Hey, Hattori.

1170
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,120
Take a look at this.

1171
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,320
I found something strange in a strange place.

1172
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,920
A battery?

1173
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,220
Wait a minute.

1174
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,420
If that came from when Mr. Kato burned up...

1175
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,420
Right. It was no suicide.

1176
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,320
It was murder.

1177
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,720
Don't worry about it.

1178
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,920
Heiji and your father are with him.

1179
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,620
Besides, there are a lot of police around here.

1180
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,620
Nothing's going to happen.

1181
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,960
The victim's name is Maho Katagiri, a member of that tour.

1182
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,560
According to Kazuha, her coat caught on fire

1183
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,260
and she fell into the moat as if she were collapsing.

1184
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,560
But the cause of death is a blow to the back of her dead.

1185
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,760
She probably got it when she fell.

1186
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,060
I think she hit her head n the girder over there.

1187
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,360
Was it suicide?

1188
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,360
It looks that way, at least for now.

1189
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,760
Kazuha, are you sure she wasn't holding anything else

1190
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,360
beside the lighter?

1191
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,760
Yes. I'm sure, that's how it looked to me.

1192
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,160
Was there anybody near her?

1193
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,560
No, not near her,

1194
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,260
but there was somebody near the bridge's entrance, right?

1195
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,160
-Yes. -That's it!

1196
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,660
That's who set her on fire!

1197
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,660
I don't think it was possible though.

1198
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,760
That person was on the same side as we were.

1199
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,060
I definitely think it was suicide though.

1200
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,160
Don't be stupid! No way it was suicide!

1201
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,860
There's got to be something here!

1202
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,860
Something to prove it was murder! There has to be!

1203
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,660
Stop that, Heiji!

1204
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,060
Dad?

1205
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,060
Heiji, stop acting like you know everything!

1206
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,660
Don't you understand?

1207
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,360
Do you know how much trouble you cause

1208
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,560
every time you meddle in police matters?

1209
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Calm down, sir!

1210
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,260
Heiji's just trying to solve the crime in his own way.

1211
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,360
Sorry.

1212
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,760
Mr. Mouri, that may be how you see it.

1213
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,860
But when it comes to this kid,

1214
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,460
you don't call his methods police work.

1215
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,460
He's a pest.

1216
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,660
People flatter him by calling him a high school detective

1217
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,860
and that's given him a swollen ego.

1218
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,060
He interferes with our investigations by handling the evidence

1219
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,560
and the victim's bodies all because it's his hobby.

1220
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,560
He's nothing more than a crime scene assaulter.

1221
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,060
To prove my point, look around two people

1222
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,860
have died right in front of his eyes

1223
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,960
and he hasn't done anything to stop it.

1224
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,760
He was so sure that nothing else would happen

1225
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,460
because the police had the area covered.

1226
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,660
Actually, you could say we were just as much at fault.

1227
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,760
At any rate.

1228
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,860
Meddlesome amateurs should leave.

1229
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,160
Get out of my sight immediately!

1230
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,860
Sir!

1231
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,660
You're being too hard on him.

1232
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,860
Otaki.

1233
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,360
Did you forget? I told you to follow that guy, didn't I?

1234
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,560
That's right! No wonder the Chief's so...

1235
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,760
Yes. That's his way of showing he cares about his son.

1236
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,860
Otaki, are these both murders?

1237
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,360
No.

1238
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,460
Regarding Mr. Kato's case,

1239
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,560
he fell from the tower as he burned

1240
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,660
and we found a lighter on the roof

1241
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,160
with the victim's fingerprints on it.

1242
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,060
As for Ms. Katagiri,

1243
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:13,560
she lit the fire on herself and fell into the moat.

1244
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,260
Kazuha herself witnessed this.

1245
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,660
There are several things we can't explain,

1246
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,860
but I'm almost certain there were both suicides.

1247
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,560
If that's the case, then 2 or 3 men

1248
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,060
should be enough of cover the work here.

1249
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,560
Huh?

1250
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,560
-Toyama, let's go. -Huh?

1251
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,760
The police have more important work to do.

1252
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,760
We can't spend so much time on a case as minor as this.

1253
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,760
Chief!

1254
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,460
Heizo.

1255
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,760
What are you planning?

1256
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,260
Don't look so disappointed, Heiji.

1257
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,760
The Chief's probably angry

1258
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,360
because two people died so close to headquarters.

1259
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,960
Still, he didn't have to hit him.

1260
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,160
Maybe it's all the killer's fault.

1261
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,860
Remember the story?

1262
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,960
About Heiji's dad driving us home

1263
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,060
and they were talking about some pottery.

1264
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,760
Well, there's a continuation to that.

1265
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,960
They said it was possible

1266
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,560
that when the burnt body was found 13 years ago

1267
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,960
there was a rash of armed burglaries

1268
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,060
and that the burglar might unexpectedly be discovered.

1269
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,460
Armed burglaries?

1270
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,160
Yes, there were five consecutive incidents.

1271
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,560
Seven people were killed

1272
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,860
and the vicious killer is still on the loose.

1273
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,760
Are you saying that Hattori's father thinks

1274
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,260
the killer in these recent cases is the same person?

1275
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,860
Now I get it.

1276
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,460
Heizo didn't want to put his son in danger

1277
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,060
so he acted coldly to distance him from the case.

1278
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,360
That's so touching. It makes me want to cry.

1279
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,860
Yeah. It makes me want to cry, too.

1280
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,560
Who'd have thought my old man would go soft like that?

1281
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,060
Heiji.

1282
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,460
I don't take orders very well.

1283
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,860
If I get pushed, I push back.

1284
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,160
I'm going to solve the case

1285
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,560
and shove the killer right up my father's nose!

1286
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,760
What he's saying is he's more stupid than obedient.

1287
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,260
But that's strange.

1288
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,160
You'd think that being his father,

1289
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,060
he would know that his son wouldn't give up so easily.

1290
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,400
You know, Heiji.

1291
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,300
You keep talking about a killer,

1292
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,800
but this doesn't look like anything else except suicide.

1293
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,200
All right, take a look at this.

1294
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,500
Look on Ms. Katagiri's right side.

1295
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,700
It's faint because it's wet, but you can still see it.

1296
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,500
There are 2 or 3 strange marks.

1297
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,200
You're right! There is strange marks here.

1298
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,700
And there're all the same.

1299
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,400
Isn't that blood?

1300
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,500
Yes, probably from the victim.

1301
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,000
From the victim?

1302
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,700
That's right. Ms. Katagiri died from a blow to the head,

1303
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,700
but she didn't get it when she fell

1304
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,300
and hit her head on the bridge girder.

1305
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,500
Someone might have hit her on the head with something hard.

1306
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Causing blood to splatter onto the killer

1307
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,200
and the blood got on her when the killer picked her up.

1308
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,200
What I'm saying is

1309
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,700
when Kazuha and Ran saw her on the bridge,

1310
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,400
she was already dead.

1311
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Another thing. The figure you saw

1312
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,000
suddenly burst into flames and fell into the moat,

1313
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,700
that's why you came to the wrong conclusion

1314
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,800
and assumed it was a suicide.

1315
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,000
But when she burst into flames,

1316
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,400
it looked like she was struggling in pain.

1317
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,000
Yes, that's right. She was definitely alive.

1318
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,700
That's what you thought you saw.

1319
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,700
It was very dark, you didn't get a good look, did you?

1320
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,000
Yes, but...

1321
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,200
Well anyway, those guys seem suspicious to me.

1322
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,700
I've got to find those three guys who were on the same tour

1323
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,300
as the two deceased people and question them.

1324
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,200
Are you talking about us?

1325
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,000
We came back right away just like you told us to

1326
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,400
and noticed the big commotion.

1327
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,700
It looks like the crowd's getting bigger.

1328
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,700
What happened here?

1329
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,400
What? I don't believe it!

1330
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,800
Ms. Katagiri fell from the bridge while burning up?

1331
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,800
From this Gokuraku Bridge?

1332
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Yes.

1333
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,100
But why would she commit suicide by setting herself on fire?

1334
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,100
It hasn't been officially declared a suicide yet.

1335
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,900
That's why we need you to answer few questions.

1336
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,900
First off, you fellows and Ms. Katagiri left this area,

1337
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,200
where did you go

1338
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,900
and what were you doing before coming back.

1339
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,400
I went to get something to eat at a small restaurant near here.

1340
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,900
I did the same.

1341
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,200
Only I went to a different restaurant.

1342
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,300
I went back to the hotel in Nanayari

1343
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,700
where we're all staying and changed my clothes.

1344
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,500
So you were with Ms. Katagiri, weren't you?

1345
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,200
Yes, until we got back to the hotel.

1346
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,700
If I'd known something like would happen,

1347
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,700
I should have stayed with her the whole time.

1348
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,700
But why did Mr. Kato and Ms. Katagiri choose fire?

1349
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,500
It's almost as if someone ordered them to do.

1350
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,000
Ordered?

1351
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,900
That reminds me, Mr. Wakisaka.

1352
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,400
You were playing the role of Nobunaga, weren't you?

1353
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,800
Yes.

1354
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,300
That means, if you ordered them to do something,

1355
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,500
they'd have to obey, wouldn't they?

1356
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,500
Well, in that case,

1357
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,200
Fukushima who could assume Nobunaga's role for 3 minutes

1358
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
-could also have done it, too. -What?

1359
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,500
I played Ieyasu, so that leaves me out of the picture.

1360
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,800
So one of you must have done it.

1361
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,100
Their duty was to entertain Nobunaga,

1362
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,100
not to take orders!

1363
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,100
Besides, no one would obey an order

1364
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,300
to set themselves on fire.

1365
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,000
And another thing. Ms. Katagiri played Nene,

1366
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
that was just a supervisory role.

1367
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,300
Also, when the first member of our party died,

1368
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,900
we wouldn't be so callous as to continue our role playing game!

1369
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,300
Yes, I see what you mean.

1370
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,700
Inspector Otaki.

1371
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,700
We've found another piece of pottery on Ms. Katagiri's body.

1372
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,600
What, again?

1373
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,600
I wonder why they all had pieces of pottery like this.

1374
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
And we found this photo, too.

1375
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,400
The young couple in the right corner...

1376
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,800
Isn't that Mr. Kato and Ms. Katagiri?

1377
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,900
You're right. So they knew each other from before.

1378
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,100
But who are the other three people?

1379
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,400
Oh, that's Hirano.

1380
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,300
Here, that's him.

1381
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,400
You're right.

1382
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,800
He looks really young, but I think that it's him.

1383
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,400
And who's this Hirano character?

1384
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,100
He planned this tour.

1385
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:47,400
We got all together because of Hirano's home page.

1386
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,500
He suggested we all go on a trip.

1387
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,700
He came up with the idea of the role playing game, too.

1388
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,600
Unfortunately, just before we were leaving on the trip,

1389
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,400
something important came up and he couldn't make it.

1390
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,900
I see.

1391
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,800
So the man planned this trip

1392
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,300
resulting in strange deaths, isn't in attendance?

1393
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,500
Are you absolutely sure Ms. Katagiri didn't commit suicide?

1394
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,900
Yes. Well, we can't say for sure just yet.

1395
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:18,000
Well, if the killer is using this tour to commit murders,

1396
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,900
the first thing we should do is talk to Mr. Hirano.

1397
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,300
All you have to do is

1398
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,800
access "Legend of the Lord of Gold" home page.

1399
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,100
-That's him. -Huh?

1400
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,100
When Ms. Katagiri burned and fell from the bridge,

1401
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,700
that's who the suspicious person behind Ran and Kazuha was.

1402
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,200
Yes, I thought so too,

1403
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
but there's something I don't understand.

1404
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,800
The killer called Ms. Katagiri out to the bridge, killed her

1405
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,400
then tied a rope around her and propped her against the railing

1406
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,200
and waited in the distance for someone to come by

1407
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,600
when the moment was right, the killer pulled the rope

1408
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,400
and she fell into the moat, that set up is easy.

1409
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,500
But to set her on fire at just the right time

1410
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,200
make it look like she was writhing in pain as she fell,

1411
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,300
that's not as easy thing to do.

1412
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,100
Another thing bothers me, too.

1413
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,200
That strange blood stain on her side.

1414
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,900
I'm pretty sure that's from blood that was on a zipper.

1415
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:20,300
But none of those three wore clothes with a zipper.

1416
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,600
There has to be a reason the killer would

1417
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,500
go to the trouble of changing into that kind of outfit

1418
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,100
then calling Ms. Katagiri out to the bridge.

1419
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,000
I know what it is.

1420
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Yeah.

1421
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,400
Now we know why the killer wore a special outfit that has a zipper.

1422
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,800
The question now is, who used that trick.

1423
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:52,300
Well, anyone of those three could have.

1424
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Hey, Heiji. Let's go already.

1425
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,900
It's getting windier, too!

1426
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,600
My umbrella!

1427
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,700
Hey, Hattori.

1428
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,600
I think we...

1429
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,300
I think we made a big mistake.

1430
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,200
Oh, my umbrella's ruined.

1431
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,400
Well, you can always buy a cheap one from that store nearby.

1432
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,000
Huh? Where's Heiji?

1433
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,100
He took Conan and went off somewhere.

1434
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,700
They probably figured out who the killer is.

1435
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,000
Huh?

1436
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,200
He was positively glowing.

1437
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,200
Gosh. They couldn't have gone so far,

1438
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,700
but I don't see them.

1439
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,700
It's no use! Only one of them is at the hotel.

1440
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,100
The other two haven't returned yet.

1441
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,500
There might be another murder.

1442
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,700
After the first and second cases are investigated thoroughly,

1443
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:08,100
the trick is bound to be exposed.

1444
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,400
So the killer's got to finish the job by tonight.

1445
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,800
Where could they have gone?

1446
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,300
Over there! That's Mr. Kasuya!

1447
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:21,100
It doesn't look like he's heading back to the hotel.

1448
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,100
It looks like he's going to finish things.

1449
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,300
Okay! I'll let the police know.

1450
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,200
Stop. If the police come,

1451
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,100
there's bound to be a commotion and he might get away.

1452
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,900
Let's you and me open this one up on our own.

1453
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,300
I'm talking about the door to the truth.

1454
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,200
Wait, Hattori!

1455
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,500
That old man went into a suspicious looking warehouse.

1456
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,100
Hattori, don't you feel something?

1457
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,600
I get this weird feeling we're being watched.

1458
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,800
Hey, what're you doing? We're going in!

1459
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,400
Okay.

1460
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,700
It's so dark here, I can't see a thing.

1461
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,800
He's over there.

1462
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,900
It looks like he's going up.

1463
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,600
Kudo, that tranquilizer you've got in your watch,

1464
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,200
-get it ready. -Yeah, I know.

1465
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,900
Hey, Kudo. What's wrong?

1466
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,600
You need to go to the toilet?

1467
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,900
Oh, no. I'm going to lose sight of him if I don't get moving.

1468
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,800
Listen, Kudo. When you finish using the toilet,

1469
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,900
catch up with me right away.

1470
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,910
Hey, sorry to make you wait.

1471
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,110
Wakisaka.

1472
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,910
No problem.

1473
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:32,010
Did you bring it with you?

1474
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,210
It's over there. Inside that box.

1475
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:37,310
I see, good!

1476
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:40,210
But there's so much stuff in here

1477
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,310
and it's so dark, I can't make anything out.

1478
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,310
I put a flashlight on the side of the box.

1479
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:48,610
Why don't you use it?

1480
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,710
Here it is!

1481
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,910
Use that and you'll be able to find what you're looking for.

1482
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,710
The tiger scroll.

1483
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:58,310
I wouldn't turn it on if I were you.

1484
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:03,010
You'll be burnt to a crisp if you do.

1485
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:08,910
Just like Mr. Kato on Osaka Castle's tower.

1486
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:11,910
Isn't that right, Mr. Wakisaka?

1487
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,110
You mean both Ms. Katagiri and Mr. Kato were...

1488
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:21,810
That's right. Mr. Wakisaka killed them.

1489
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:25,210
He used the same trick he used on you.

1490
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,410
He lured the three of you out

1491
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:29,310
by saying that he'd found the tiger scroll.

1492
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,810
It was easy with Mr. Kato.

1493
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:34,410
All he had to do was tell him that

1494
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:38,310
he hid the scroll under one of the tiles on the roof of the tower.

1495
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:39,610
in order to climb out on the roof,

1496
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,510
you'd avoid going in the afternoon

1497
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,910
when a lot of people would be around and wait until night.

1498
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:46,810
Going out there at night is fine, but without a light,

1499
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,010
you wouldn't be able to tell which tile it was under.

1500
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,510
Mr. Kato had no other choice,

1501
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:52,710
so he took the lighter he had out

1502
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,110
and lit it so he could look around.

1503
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:59,910
He saw a flashlight just lying there as if waiting to be found.

1504
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,710
Mr. Wakisaka had left it there earlier.

1505
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:09,410
It was rigged to explode when it was switched on.

1506
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,210
I see.

1507
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,410
So you're saying Mr. Kato chose to use the flashlight

1508
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,310
which was handier,

1509
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,910
but when he turned it on, it exploded.

1510
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,010
That's right.

1511
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,110
The flashlight exploded into tiny pieces

1512
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:27,110
and the lighter with his fingerprints on was left on the roof,

1513
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:30,610
making it look like he set himself on fire.

1514
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:34,510
That would explain the dry mark

1515
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,510
that was left under the lighter.

1516
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,610
You wouldn't get that kind of mark

1517
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,410
unless you put a lighter on a round shaped mark.

1518
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,410
Besides, we found a burnt battery

1519
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,610
on the ground near the castle.

1520
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:49,910
But how did he kill Ms. Katagiri?

1521
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:53,610
According to the girls who witnessed it,

1522
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,610
when she set herself on fire,

1523
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,410
there was no one else around.

1524
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,310
And she was writhing in pain,

1525
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:04,610
as she fell into the moat.

1526
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:07,210
And all she had in her hand as a lighter.

1527
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,110
Suicide is the only conclusion.

1528
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:13,110
I don't blame you for thinking like that.

1529
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:15,710
But it wasn't her that set herself on fire

1530
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,010
and fell into the moat.

1531
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:21,610
It was Mr. Wakisaka.

1532
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,910
What?

1533
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:27,210
After the crowd that was gathered near the tower left

1534
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:31,910
and people walking around thinned out around the bridge,

1535
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:35,610
he called her out after making her change into a coat.

1536
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:39,810
Then he killed her by striking her with a hard object,

1537
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:42,810
then he threw her into the moat.

1538
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:45,310
Her body floated on the water

1539
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:48,610
and he poured kerosene on her, setting the stage.

1540
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,910
All he had to do was wait for someone to pass the bridge

1541
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,310
then set fire to his coat,

1542
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,510
and pretend to writhe in pain

1543
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,310
dropping the lighter into the moat,

1544
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:59,510
the lighter would set fire to Ms. Katagiri's body floating in the moat.

1545
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,110
After that, he jumped into the moat

1546
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,110
and dove underwater.

1547
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:06,010
The only thing visible would be

1548
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:10,610
Ms. Katagiri's body burning in the water.

1549
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:13,610
What you're saying is, even when her body

1550
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:16,710
was lifted out of the water and examined,

1551
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:19,110
the injury on her head which was the actual cause of her death,

1552
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,310
would appear to have been a result of her hitting her head on the girder

1553
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:23,310
because the witnesses would testify

1554
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:28,810
that she set fire to herself and fell from the bridge.

1555
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,810
That's right.

1556
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,710
But it only went as smoothly as it did

1557
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:35,110
because those girls happened to pass by at just the right moment.

1558
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,310
If a lot of time had passed before anyone had walked by,

1559
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,710
the time of death would be off, wouldn't it?

1560
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:41,710
Not really.

1561
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:45,310
Because Mr. Wakisaka had already prepared a witness.

1562
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,710
It was mere coincidence

1563
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,610
that Kazuha and Ran saw what happened first,

1564
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:52,110
it appears the intended witness ran away from the scene though.

1565
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:55,510
Don't tell me that it was...

1566
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,610
It was Mr. Fukushima.

1567
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:00,210
He didn't know anything about the incident,

1568
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:03,510
but when he heard a burning body fell into the moat,

1569
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:06,210
he immediately said it was suicide.

1570
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:07,810
Think about it.

1571
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:08,910
If someone were going to commit suicide

1572
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,410
by setting themselves on fire,

1573
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:13,610
they wouldn't jump into water. It would put the fire out.

1574
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:16,710
It would be natural to assume that you'd jump into the water

1575
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,410
only if someone else set fire to you, isn't that right?

1576
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,810
What he said proves that he witnessed her

1577
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,210
jumping into the moat after setting herself on fire.

1578
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:25,910
Judging by the events of the day,

1579
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,510
all a person would have to do is disguise their voice

1580
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,410
pretending to be the police and call him out to the bridge,

1581
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:32,510
he would have gone there right away.

1582
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,910
But it's awfully strange.

1583
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,310
After what happened,

1584
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,910
Mr. Wakisaka's hair and clothes weren't all that wet.

1585
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,010
And if by chance something went wrong,

1586
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,310
he could have been seriously burned.

1587
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:45,610
He was wearing a dry suit

1588
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:48,210
under his coat over his clothes.

1589
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,410
If he wear to put the hood on before setting fire to himself,

1590
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,310
he wouldn't get burned,

1591
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:55,410
and neither his hair or his clothes would get wet

1592
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,610
so he could swim underwater.

1593
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:58,710
Until he got far away from the bridge

1594
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,710
then climb up the stone wall,

1595
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,810
and after he hid the dry suit and coat somewhere,

1596
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,310
he went and joined the crowd

1597
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,610
so as not to draw suspicion to himself.

1598
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:11,110
Incidentally, both the flammable fleece Mr. Kato wore,

1599
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:15,910
and Ms. Katagiri's coat were given to them by you, right?

1600
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:19,010
You probably told them that it would be easy for them

1601
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:21,310
to spot each other when they snuck off to meet in secret.

1602
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:24,910
Did you know there was blood on Ms. Katagiri's coat?

1603
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,910
Her blood splattered on your clothes

1604
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:29,010
and then you got it on her.

1605
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:32,410
It got on her when you carried her.

1606
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,910
They were shaped like the zipper on a dry suit

1607
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:39,410
and the edge of that badge you have on your chest.

1608
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:40,410
Which means that

1609
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:43,910
if we were to check that Nobunaga badge you're wearing,

1610
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:47,010
we'll have the proof to nail you.

1611
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:49,810
But why did he want to kill me and the other two?

1612
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:52,010
You three weren't the only ones.

1613
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,710
He killed the man who planned this trip, Mr. Hirano too.

1614
01:20:55,710 --> 01:21:00,210
I asked a professor I know to access Mr. Hirano's home page,

1615
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,810
he found that Mr. Hirano had been putting new entries on a daily basis

1616
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:05,110
but he stopped 3 weeks ago.

1617
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:08,710
Remember that burnt body they found in the outer moat recently?

1618
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,510
That was probably...

1619
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:12,510
Yeah, that's right.

1620
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:17,110
I killed Hirano, Kato and Katagiri

1621
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:20,010
in dedication to my grandfather Masakiyo

1622
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,010
who loved Hideyoshi and was killed for it.

1623
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,110
Your grandfather?

1624
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:27,610
You saw the picture, didn't you?

1625
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:30,010
The old man in the middle holding the scroll open

1626
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,110
was my grandfather.

1627
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:35,310
He always used to tell me

1628
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,810
about the scroll he'd found

1629
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,810
and about the clues to Hideyoshi's treasure.

1630
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:43,610
He told me he wanted to give up looking for the treasure

1631
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:47,610
and donate the scroll to the country.

1632
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,810
But the others didn't agree

1633
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:52,410
and they began to argue about it.

1634
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:56,610
Then 13 years ago, he told us he was going to Osaka

1635
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,810
to try and convince the others to agree with him,

1636
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,210
and he never came back.

1637
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:06,110
You mean the burnt body they found in the moat 13 years ago...

1638
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,410
Was my grandfather. He was killed by his partners.

1639
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:13,510
Grandfather found that piece of pottery along with the scroll

1640
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,310
but he didn't tell the others about it.

1641
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,410
That photo was the only clue I had

1642
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:21,110
as to who his partners were,

1643
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:23,410
so I had a hard time finding them.

1644
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,610
And I never imagined that one of them

1645
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,010
would change how they looked.

1646
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:33,510
You mean that old man on the left is...

1647
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,210
That's me.

1648
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:41,810
Something happened, and I had to change my appearance.

1649
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:43,810
Ms. Katagiri seemed to suspect

1650
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:47,110
that I was a member of their former group.

1651
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,210
I don't care what happens to me,

1652
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:54,810
but are you going to kill Mr. Wakisaka too?

1653
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,910
You'll never find out where the treasure is.

1654
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:02,510
I assume you haven't brought the tiger scroll with you.

1655
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,210
I've already found out where Mr. Wakisaka lives

1656
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:07,510
I'll just tear his house apart.

1657
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:10,010
Both of you move to the back, quickly!

1658
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:13,110
Pick up that flashlight and turn it on.

1659
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:15,510
I'm going to have you two fall to the ground.

1660
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,110
It's going to look like the killer and the teenage detective

1661
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:21,310
fell to their deaths while engulfed in flames.

1662
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:25,010
By the way, before you die, answer my question.

1663
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:28,510
How did you figure out Mr. Wakisaka was the killer?

1664
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:32,510
Anyone could have used that trick you just explained.

1665
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,910
What tipped you off?

1666
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,410
Why should I tell you?

1667
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:39,310
It was the umbrella.

1668
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:45,010
In Mr. Kato's last moment, he grabbed hold of an umbrella,

1669
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:47,110
it was his dying message.

1670
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,710
He was indicating Nobunaga's standard, the golden umbrella.

1671
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:55,910
That's how he knew Mr. Wakisaka was the killer.

1672
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,310
You little brat! When'd you get up there?

1673
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,010
Get down here!

1674
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:03,110
Or I'll fill your friend here with holes!

1675
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:04,510
No! Don't come down there!

1676
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:06,510
I guess I don't have a choice.

1677
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,910
You idiot!

1678
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:10,110
What a good little boy.

1679
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:17,510
You're Heizo Hattori!

1680
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:20,610
Dad?

1681
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,710
You may have changed how you looked 13 years ago

1682
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,110
but it seems like you can't change

1683
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,910
that sick voice or that warped personality.

1684
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:35,410
You're under arrest for possession of an illegal weapon

1685
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,810
and for attempted murder!

1686
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,910
Also for the five robbery murders you committed

1687
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,910
because you failed to find the treasure.

1688
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:47,310
You're going to pay for what you did!

1689
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,210
Robbery murders?

1690
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,510
I don't know what you're talking about!

1691
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,810
No use pretending!

1692
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:55,610
We've get your voice on tape, on the spur of the moment,

1693
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:57,410
the victim recorded it on his answering machine,

1694
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:59,310
and we've also got your handprint on the telephone

1695
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:02,010
when you hung it up!

1696
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,610
There's no sympathy for those who turn against their friends.

1697
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,410
If you don't want to get hurt...

1698
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,910
Come along quiet like and let us put these cuffs on you!

1699
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:25,710
So the case that spanned 13 years

1700
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:30,310
was personally solved by the head of Osaka's prefectural police

1701
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:33,110
while we watched in wonder,

1702
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:35,810
it all happened in a blink of an eye.

1703
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,110
You must feel good about this.

1704
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,010
You sent each of us a piece of that pottery

1705
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,910
and baited us with all that talk of the tiger scroll,

1706
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:31,210
you knew that would make us join the tour.

1707
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:36,010
You succeeded in avenging your grandfather with one blow.

1708
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:37,010
And on top of that,

1709
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:41,610
your family's got Hideyoshi's treasure all to themselves.

1710
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:46,210
That was no treasure map.

1711
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:47,710
What do you mean?

1712
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:51,110
This is what was written on the tiger scroll.

1713
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,810
"This is to certify that I have received

1714
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,810
the 1,000 items depicted on the dragon scroll.

1715
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,310
From Kajisuke."

1716
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:01,310
Kajisuke? Isn't he the thief who was after Hideyoshi's gold,

1717
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:04,610
the one who went down into the Kinmeisui well?

1718
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:05,810
That's right.

1719
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:09,710
Kajisuke left that letter intending it be a joke.

1720
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:15,010
Then why didn't that grandfather of yours tell us?

1721
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:17,610
He couldn't.

1722
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:19,010
Not to his friends who were so excited

1723
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:21,310
about finding the treasure,

1724
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:25,810
especially not to you who had invested so much money in the project.

1725
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,510
That's ridiculous.

1726
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:47,010
What? We were bait?

1727
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:50,310
Yes. This is what your father said.

1728
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,210
Sorry, Conan.

1729
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:55,610
But his men are all pros, they can spot a cop a mile away.

1730
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:57,310
In order to solve this case as quickly as possible,

1731
01:28:57,310 --> 01:29:01,310
I thought it'd be best just to have Heiji followed

1732
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:05,010
because he always takes chances.

1733
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:06,210
So now you know.

1734
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,110
So he hit me to get me mad

1735
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:11,110
because he knew I'd take the risks?

1736
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:12,210
Yeah.

1737
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:16,010
He said he knew a lot of Mr. Kasuya's accomplices were coming here.

1738
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:18,410
Because you need a lot of men

1739
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:20,210
to transport 1,000 golden gourds.

1740
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:22,410
But before I was got into trouble,

1741
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,010
Inspector Otaki, who was staking things out,

1742
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:26,110
took me into protective custody.

1743
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,910
Hold it a second! You said stake out,

1744
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,810
does that mean dad knew Mr. Wakisaka was the killer?

1745
01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:34,710
Yeah. When he questioned the people on the scene

1746
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:36,010
and found out Mr. Kato had grabbed the umbrella,

1747
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:39,610
he had someone follow Mr. Wakisaka.

1748
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:42,810
That beady eyed sneak of a father.

1749
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:45,510
If he ever tries something like this again,

1750
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:47,010
I'm going to stick my finger in his ear

1751
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,610
and rattle it around so he can't talk!

1752
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:52,210
Ouch!

1753
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:55,810
Shizu, can't you be do it a little gently?

1754
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:58,010
Don't complain.

1755
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:01,110
I'm paying you back for putting Heiji through so much.

1756
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,480
Next Conan's Hint:

1757
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,460
"Cellphone"
