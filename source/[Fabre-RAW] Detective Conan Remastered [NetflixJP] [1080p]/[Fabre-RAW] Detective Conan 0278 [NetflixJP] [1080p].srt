1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,570
Suspense and deduction closes the gap

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,370
between the love and hatred between two people.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,170
Mysteries abound. Strange events.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,270
Conan and Heiji. What will Jodie do?

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,970
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,110
Hattori and I have some doubts that Jodie, the teacher,

9
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,510
belongs to the Black organization.

10
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,260
So, we went to Jodie's room to see her.

11
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,460
But, we encountered an unexpected incident

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,860
at the entrance of her condominium.

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Why is something like this...

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,460
Falling from above?

15
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,560
A man came falling from the 21st floor!

16
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,560
Had the front door been locked?

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,060
Yeah! It was locked up tight!

18
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Well, this room was locked up.

19
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,760
So, it must be suicide.

20
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,960
That is what I first thought too.

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,560
Until I saw the curtain of the bedroom window from where Mr. Takai jumped!

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
The curtain was tagged down and the curtain rail was bent

23
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,260
and a few hooks came off, right?

24
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,460
Yes.

25
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,760
This shows evidence that he involuntarily grabbed the curtain

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,060
when he came close to falling.

27
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,860
Would someone trying to kill himself do that?

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,460
So, then this is not suicide but in fact...

29
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,560
Murder.

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,460
This is a homicide case.

31
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,760
"English Teacher vs. Great Western Detective (Part 2)"

32
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,660
And it's also a murder in a locked room,

33
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,910
like we so often see in novels or movies!

34
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,810
But, teacher...

35
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,110
Why are you here anyway?

36
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,010
My room is next door to Mr. Takai's.

37
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,410
Oh, really?

38
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,910
Those two just came to visit me.

39
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,310
And just when we were leaving the building to eat out for dinner,

40
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,710
Mr. Takai came falling down in front of us.

41
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,110
That's right!

42
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,710
And then?

43
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,010
So have you solved this locked room murder mystery?

44
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,610
No, not yet.

45
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,510
But I think the strange mark on the window glass

46
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,010
may have something to do with it.

47
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,310
Strange mark?

48
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,910
Yes. There is a mark like something hit it from outside.

49
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,910
But what?

50
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,010
Inspector Megure!

51
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,310
We've finished developing the pictures that Ms. Shimoda took.

52
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,810
Oh, that was fast!

53
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,810
Most are just ordinary photos of the building,

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,810
but there was a picture with a strange figure.

55
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,410
So, we blew up the picture.

56
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,410
This is the picture.

57
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,410
Isn't this...

58
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,310
It's Mr. Takai!

59
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,810
He grabbed the curtain after all.

60
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,610
He's throwing something into the room.

61
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,710
Isn't that a cell phone?

62
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,810
Okay then, he threw the cell phone at the window and made the mark on it.

63
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,010
But why did he throw it anyway?

64
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,810
Maybe a call made him very angry.

65
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,710
That can't be it.

66
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,410
Shut your mouths!

67
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,210
This is police business!

68
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,410
You civilians, don't belong here!

69
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,410
Talk about hot tempered!

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,910
I was going to help him but no anymore.

71
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,710
I'm fed up with those guys. How could this happen to me so frequently?

72
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,610
Yet, although it's true that they may be annoying,

73
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,810
for some reason, with them around, the case is usual solved.

74
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,610
I don't get it.

75
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,010
Me neither.

76
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,410
I don't know in what way the culprit lead Mr. Takai to jump from the window.

77
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,210
All Ms. Shimoda could've done

78
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,610
was shock him with the flash of his camera.

79
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,910
And there was nothing strange about the mail

80
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,810
that Mr. Nakamachi sent.

81
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,210
The only one left is Mr. Kawakami, who called him, but...

82
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,710
No one would jump to death from the window

83
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,610
only because he's told to do so, would he?

84
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,610
Another thing that bothers me

85
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,810
is the reason why he threw the cell phone into the room.

86
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,610
A plausible explanation could be

87
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,710
that he left a clue in his cell phone,

88
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,010
so he didn't want it to drop and break.

89
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,710
However, the cell phone didn't break even if it fell,

90
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,710
and there were no suspicious letters on the screen either...

91
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,410
What?

92
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,110
Hello?

93
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,710
What time is it now?

94
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,010
What?

95
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,910
What time is it now?

96
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,610
What time...

97
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,910
It's 8.00 pm.

98
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,210
What time do you think it is now, you dumb dork?

99
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,110
Kazuha?

100
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,410
Who is it?

101
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,110
I don't know.

102
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,610
Darn! I've completely forgotten to meet her!

103
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,010
What're you doing, Heiji?

104
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,910
You're the one who said that you wanted to

105
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,210
go try out the delicious restaurant that Mr. Ootaki told you about!

106
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,210
Sorry, but I don't think I'll make it today.

107
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,910
Hey, Heiji! Where're you now?

108
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,010
I can't hear you well!

109
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,310
I'm in a weak signal area!

110
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,010
Heiji? Are you listening?

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,910
So... I can't get to where you are from here.

112
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,010
So, where the heck are you?

113
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,610
Tokyo. I'm in Tokyo!

114
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,210
What? Tokyo!

115
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,710
Oh, yeah, that's right.

116
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,010
I was going to get back to you

117
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,010
as soon as I finished what I had to do but...

118
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,610
What're you talking about?

119
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,910
You said we'd meet in front of

120
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,610
the Big Man of Umeda, at 7.00 pm tonight!

121
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,910
I wrote it down in my memo too.

122
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,010
Memo...

123
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,610
I see.

124
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,810
So, that's what it was.

125
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,710
No mistake.

126
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,810
Yeah, the murderer is that guy!

127
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,110
What? An experiment?

128
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,010
Here, right now?

129
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,010
Yeah, that's right!

130
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,610
If we reenact what the three did

131
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,910
before Mr. Takai fell to his death from the 21st floor,

132
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,810
we may be able to solve the mystery

133
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,610
of the locked room murder quite easily!

134
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,810
But...

135
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,310
Ms. Shimoda was only taking photos

136
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,210
and Mr. Nakamachi was only sending mail.

137
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,210
It's true that Mr. Kawakami

138
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,410
in his drunken state, cursed Mr. Takai on the phone

139
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,010
but it's far from murder.

140
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,910
Oh, come on. Let's give it a try!

141
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,110
However, in order to carry out the experiment, we're missing some things.

142
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,710
Missing some things?

143
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,510
What on earth are you talking about?

144
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,110
Liquor!

145
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,510
Remember, Mr. Takai fell asleep drunk before he fell to his death!

146
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,210
Yeah, that's true.

147
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,710
But who's going to play the role of the drunk victim?

148
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,710
Yeah, that's the problem. The police officer can't drink on duty.

149
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,810
That goes without saying.

150
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,810
I'm under age.

151
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,410
The only person who can play the role is...

152
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,810
Me?

153
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,510
Right, Ms. Saintemillion!

154
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,510
Will you play the role of the drunk victim for us?

155
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,210
Okay! But on one condition.

156
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,810
Can you prepare my favorite liquor?

157
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,210
As you wish. What is it?

158
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,910
Oh, good!

159
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,610
It's very delicious.

160
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,110
Glad you like it.

161
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,310
I feel I can drink like a fish now!

162
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,210
All right, Inspector,

163
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,210
we'll get everything set up.

164
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,610
Oh, okay.

165
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,310
Well...

166
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,710
What is it, Mr. Nakamachi?

167
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,010
We came here because you said you wanted us to check the crime scene.

168
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,310
But the foreign woman

169
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,610
is drinking in the bedroom of Mr. Takai, what's this crap?

170
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,810
Please give us a good explanation!

171
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,210
Well, we're going to re-enact the crime just as it happened.

172
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,410
Are you all set?

173
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,210
Yeah. Ms. Saintemillion is asleep on the bed

174
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,310
and I've put my cell phone next to the pillow.

175
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,210
And we reorganized the room a little bit without telling her.

176
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,710
How did you change the room?

177
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,510
You'll see when you look at it.

178
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,510
All right, let's start the experiment.

179
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,810
First, Mr. Nakamachi sent an e-mail

180
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,010
to Mr. Takai's cell phone, right?

181
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,010
Yes.

182
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,210
So, I have to send an e-mail too.

183
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,810
I've got mail.

184
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,610
"Who are you?"

185
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,610
Hey, teacher! Did you get my mail?

186
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,110
Oh, yes! I've got a lovely e-mail!

187
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,410
Oh, really?

188
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,710
Hey, Hattori. What kind of mail did you send her?

189
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,210
Don't worry about it!

190
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,810
Next for the flashes of Ms. Shimoda's camera,

191
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,310
as she took photos of the condo from the ground.

192
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,310
Officer Chiba, get with it!

193
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,310
Yes, sir!

194
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,910
But will this experiment help us

195
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,910
to solve the mystery of the locked room murder?

196
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,210
We'll never know until it's over.

197
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,110
And last, is Mr. Kawakami, who made the call.

198
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,410
That's bullshit.

199
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,610
Hello?

200
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,710
Oh, teacher?

201
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,910
Let's just chat for a while.

202
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,710
Okay. What shall we talk about?

203
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,710
Let's see, like...

204
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,310
How about answering the mail I just sent to you?

205
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,560
How about answering the mail I just sent to you?

206
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,860
Okay,

207
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,360
but first, let me ask about you!

208
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
Who on earth are you?

209
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,860
What?

210
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,860
Tell me that first.

211
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,860
You're not a mere boy, are you?

212
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,260
You're not a mere boy, are you?

213
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,460
Yes, I'm just a normal high school boy.

214
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,660
Really?

215
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,060
It's hard to hear you. What's wrong?

216
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,560
Oh, it's because this is a high rise condominium.

217
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,960
It often happens when I use the cell phone here.

218
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Hold on!

219
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,060
I can hear you better if I go out on the veranda.

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,160
What?

221
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,360
Help! Help me! Hurry!

222
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,060
-Help me! -What's up?

223
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,460
Help!

224
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,260
Ms. Jodie, are you okay?

225
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,560
Oh, thank you, Detective.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,960
What is this?

227
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,460
You see, we changed the position of the bed.

228
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,660
In the expectation that Jodie would go out

229
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,460
with the cell phone onto the balcony to get a better connection.

230
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,760
She believed that she could get to the balcony from the window

231
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,060
which was supposed to be diagonally across from the bed.

232
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,860
But actually that window has no balcony.

233
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,760
So, she almost fell just like Mr. Takaki fell to his death!

234
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,360
You and Mr. Takai were talking on the phone

235
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,260
just before he plunged to his death, right, Mr. Noboru Kawakami?

236
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,860
Well, originally, Mr. Takai's bed was placed

237
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,860
in front of this window.

238
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,360
But the criminal moved the bed

239
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,460
to the front of that window without a balcony.

240
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,860
I see.

241
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,360
When he got the call on his cell phone,

242
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Mr. Takai tried to go out of the window

243
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,760
next to his bed as usual.

244
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,860
Yeah, that's right.

245
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,460
Mr. Kawakami perhaps moved the bed

246
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,960
when he was drinking with Mr. Takai in the living room.

247
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,860
Mr. Kawakami excused himself,

248
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,160
most likely saying that he was going to the bathroom.

249
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,560
Then, he sneaked into Mr. Takai's bedroom

250
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,260
and moved his bed.

251
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,960
Then Mr. Takai, who was drunk and asleep in the living room,

252
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,760
was carried to his bedroom.

253
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
And Mr. Kawakami put the cell phone at the bedside.

254
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
All that was left to do was...

255
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,360
To call and say, "I can't hear you!" That's all.

256
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,860
-No way. -It can't be.

257
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,560
But what if Jodie had fallen because of this experiment?

258
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,260
She would've been fine!

259
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
What?

260
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,060
You see.

261
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Look at that!

262
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,460
We tied a rope her waist without telling her!

263
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,060
I didn't realize it at all!

264
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,360
Well, that's the story.

265
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,260
Mr. Kawakami, all you have to do is explain

266
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,560
to the police why you killed Mr. Takai.

267
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,960
Yeah, I'll do that,

268
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,060
if I had intended to murder him.

269
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,360
What?

270
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,960
Yes, it's true that I changed the position of the bed

271
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,160
because Takai told me that he wanted to rearrange his room.

272
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,060
So I just helped him!

273
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
But what a shock to hear that

274
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,260
he fell to his death because of it.

275
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,060
It didn't even cross my mind until you pointed it out.

276
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,560
Goodbye, Takai.

277
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,160
What?

278
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,860
Go to the world beyond and tell her that you're sorry.

279
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,960
I was also very shocked

280
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,160
that you left him a message like this.

281
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,860
Mr. Kawakami.

282
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,560
You might not know,

283
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,060
but before he fell, Mr. Takai tried to hang on for a while

284
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,660
by grabbing the curtain.

285
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,160
Just before his death,

286
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,960
he pressed the voice memo button of his cell phone

287
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
and recorded your words, which provided evidence

288
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,860
that you had the intention to kill him.

289
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,060
Your sad words of parting, saying that you were satisfied that

290
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,060
you had avenged the death of your dear girl, your junior in school.

291
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,660
Here you go. It's your camera that you lent me a while ago.

292
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,760
Yes.

293
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,560
I appreciate your cooperation.

294
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,360
Thank you for acting as if you had been tricked.

295
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,460
Oh, think nothing of it at all.

296
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,160
I enjoyed it too!

297
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,460
By the way,

298
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,260
you didn't tell me your name, did you?

299
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,360
Before I tell you my name, won't you tell me your true identity?

300
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,360
But as for me,

301
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,060
I want to know why you pretend not being able to speak English

302
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,360
even though you can speak very well!

303
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,060
What are you talking about?

304
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,160
No use playing dumb!

305
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
When we talked on the phone a little while ago...

306
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,860
I asked you, "You're not a mere boy, are you?"

307
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,760
Then you answered, "Yes, I'm just a normal high school boy".

308
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,160
In this case, "No, I'm just another boy" is correct in Japanese grammar,

309
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
but your answer was "Yes, I'm just a normal high school boy".

310
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Only a good speaker of English

311
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,560
could have answered the way you did.

312
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,460
I'll bet you answered unconsciously in English to me

313
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,360
since I'm an English-speaking foreigner.

314
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,660
My true identity is an English teacher! You can't fool me!

315
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,160
Well, actually, I wasn't pretending

316
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
not to be able to speak English. But...

317
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,660
Did silence work better than your funny disguised Japanese, didn't it?

318
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,260
Your Japanese grammar is excellent

319
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,660
but your Japanese intonation is terrible.

320
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,760
So, it's obvious that you're just pretending

321
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,560
not being able to speak Japanese well

322
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,060
to throw people off their guard.

323
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,560
But we can talk about it at another time.

324
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,160
So, see ya.

325
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,160
But if he knew that much,

326
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
don't you think that the victim role player

327
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,760
didn't need to actually get drunk

328
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,260
in order to carry out that experiment?

329
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes. I think so too.

330
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,960
Yeah, that teacher is a very suspicious character indeed.

331
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,360
Secretly taking photos of us, pretending to take a bath and all.

332
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,060
Yeah.

333
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,360
Her hair and body was wet

334
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,560
while the hair dryer was still warm

335
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,360
and the body lotion spilled on the bathroom floor wasn't dry.

336
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,860
She had probably finished taking a bath before we got there.

337
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,660
But, in order to buy time, she took another hurried shower.

338
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,560
She was probably using that time to do something

339
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,160
she didn't want us to see.

340
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,160
But don't worry yourself over it.

341
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,060
I've already taken the film out of her camera.

342
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,360
She's suspicious, but she didn't look like a bad person.

343
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
And you suspected that the teacher and the American actress,

344
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,360
Chris Vineyard were the same person,

345
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,860
but they didn't look alike at all.

346
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,460
The only similarity is that they both have big boobs.

347
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,660
Yeah. That's right.

348
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,210
If that is her true face...

349
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,610
What do you mean?

350
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,110
But, don't you have to go back?

351
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,710
Isn't she waiting for you?

352
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,310
Oh, no...

353
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,410
I completely forgot about Kazuha.

354
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,110
Anyway, be careful, Kudo!

355
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,910
Your enemy was sharp enough to steal the document

356
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,210
from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police!

357
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,210
Yeah.

358
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,310
See ya!

359
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,010
If any other suspicious persons show up, just call me!

360
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,110
I'll run right over!

361
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,910
Thanks but Jodie isn't the only one that's suspicious.

362
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,910
There are two other suspicious persons around me.

363
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,810
Heiji Hattori...

364
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,610
an interesting boy.

365
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,710
Son of Heizo Hattori,

366
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,310
General Manager of Osaka Police Department

367
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,510
And...

368
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,610
Just like Shinichi Kudo...

369
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,610
He's a private eye.

370
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,580
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,260
"Ticket"
