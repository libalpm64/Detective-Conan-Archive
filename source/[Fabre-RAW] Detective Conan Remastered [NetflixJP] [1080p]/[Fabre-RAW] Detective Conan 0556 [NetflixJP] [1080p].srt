"Caution! Many Accidents at Intersection"

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,245
Oh, a rainbow!

3
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:17,345
See, it's beautiful!

4
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:19,245
A rainbow...

5
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:24,003
Boy, staying up all night playing mahjong.

6
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:28,007
Wrong. It was a match of a life time.

7
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:31,145
Because Yoko Okino's picture was at stake.

8
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,015
I doubt if it's something that you should do

9
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,545
after coming all the way to a hot spring.

10
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,545
Look at that!

11
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,031
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

12
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,345
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,035
The view if clear and yet many accidents occur.

14
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,345
There's something suspicious about the devilish intersection.

15
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,039
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,845
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,345
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

18
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:52,151
"Intersection of fear"

19
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:56,691
It's an accident!

20
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,169
Ran, you go over to the car on that side!

21
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,091
Okay!

22
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,173
This is...

23
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,179
No good! I can't rescue him!

24
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,691
Ran, how is it on your side?

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,191
I can't open the door!

26
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:27,591
Please get a hold of yourself!

27
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,291
Hey, both these cars were parked

28
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,391
at the convenience store a while ago, right?

29
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,891
Never mind about that!

30
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,391
Are you all right?

31
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:41,491
Yeah, I guess so.

32
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,205
What happened?

33
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,491
You seem to have gotten into a traffic accident.

34
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,891
I'm sure there was another car involved.

35
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,691
I tried to help him,

36
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,491
but the car was on fire and I couldn't get close.

37
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:00,219
Are you all right?

38
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,991
Ran, call the ambulance and the police!

39
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:03,991
Yes!

40
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,291
Why did this happen?

41
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,891
It's such a big accident.

42
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:25,591
What shall I do?

43
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:28,991
I've done something terrible!

44
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:31,391
Come... please calm down.

45
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,991
Would you like a cigarette?

46
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:36,791
Oh, but I don't smoke.

47
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,691
Oh, I see.

48
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,291
You're the one who was driving the green car?

49
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,591
Yes.

50
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:47,091
Would it be okay if I asked you some questions?

51
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,691
-Yes. -First of all, could you tell me your name and occupation?

52
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:54,591
"Seiji Kurumatani, age 28" -Seiji Kurumatani. I'm an auto mechanic.

53
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,991
You're the first person who found him?

54
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:57,991
Your name please?

55
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:05,691
Oh, you're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

56
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,291
I've heard about you.

57
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,289
Oh well, it's no big deal.

58
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,891
You mean, that Kogoro Mouri?

59
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:14,991
"Michida Junko, age 38" -I'm so honored

60
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,295
"Michida Junko, age 38" -to get help from a famed detective.

61
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,691
And, you're the first one who found the cars

62
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:20,291
who got into an accident, Mr. Mouri?

63
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,591
Yes, the red one was already on flames.

64
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:28,291
Mr. Hayato Hayamizu who was driving the car was found dead.

65
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,991
Mr. Kurumatani...

66
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:33,091
will you tell me about the time the accident occurred?

67
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,891
Yes.

68
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,791
When I was ready to enter the intersection,

69
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,791
I, for some reason, didn't realize the other car coming at all.

70
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,791
I just kept going straight,

71
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,325
then, the red car suddenly appeared in front of me.

72
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,691
I slammed on the brakes and turned the wheels,

73
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,791
but I couldn't avoid the car.

74
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,335
Didn't you stop once

75
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,891
before entering the intersection?

76
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,339
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,791
I wasn't careful enough.

78
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,891
That's why accidents occur.

79
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,347
The steel column is so bent out of shape.

80
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:13,091
The front of this car is reinforced with a grill guard.

81
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:20,891
But, the thing about the other car

82
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:22,991
suddenly appearing in front of him bothers me.

83
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,791
I'll bet you were dozing off while driving,

84
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,791
or didn't have your eyes on the road.

85
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,191
Neither!

86
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,491
I was looking ahead while driving like I should,

87
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,373
but I didn't see the other car at all!

88
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,375
No way!

89
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,691
It's an intersection located right in the middle of a rice field

90
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,091
and has a clear view, you know.

91
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,383
It could be that...

92
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:45,491
That?

93
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:49,191
This place is known for frequent accidents occurring.

94
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,191
The locals call it the intersection of fear.

95
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:56,395
The intersection of fear?

96
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,791
According to a story I heard,

97
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,891
it's said that the cause of the accidents

98
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:02,091
is due to the collision course phenomenon.

99
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,691
What's that thing called the collision course?

100
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,407
The collision course phenomenon.

101
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,191
It's an intersection with a clear view,

102
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,691
and in broad daylight, but still accidents occur.

103
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:18,417
When two cars head into the intersection at the same speed,

104
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,391
both cars will be positioned at an angle of 45 degrees

105
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:23,291
at all times from the front.

106
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,691
In other words, the other car always look to be in the same position,

107
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,391
outside your visual range.

108
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,991
The vision of humans

109
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:34,433
are broadly divided into central and peripheral vision,

110
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:35,891
but since it is difficult

111
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:39,091
to confirm small things using peripheral vision,

112
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,441
mutually noticing the other car may be delayed,

113
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:46,091
and both cars may enter the intersection without noticing the other,

114
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,291
thus, crash into each other.

115
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,453
Then, you're saying that Mr. Kurumatani's accident

116
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,891
was also because of that korean course phenomenon?

117
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:59,391
It's collision course.

118
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:02,461
That could've been the reason the accident occurred.

119
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:06,465
I had no idea there was such a phenomenon.

120
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:09,491
I should've... I should've been more careful driving.

121
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,891
But...

122
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:17,591
There aren't any traces

123
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,691
whatsoever of braking with the red car.

124
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:21,391
The driver in the red car

125
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:24,091
didn't notice the other car coming at all too, then.

126
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:27,091
Which makes the collision course phenomenon

127
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,487
even more plausible.

128
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:31,491
But, I just can't believe yet that both car

129
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,493
wouldn't notice each other

130
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,191
in a spacious place like this.

131
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,491
I guess you're suspicious of everything

132
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:40,499
because you're a detective.

133
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:44,291
The two cars that we saw

134
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,991
at the convenience store are all smashed up.

135
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,891
Right, Pops?

136
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:50,509
Yeah... right.

137
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,691
What? Both cars were at the convenience store?

138
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,691
Yes, when we stopped over to buy canned coffee,

139
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:01,991
we saw both cars leave the parking lot almost simultaneously.

140
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:07,091
Hold it.

141
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:09,691
Come to think of it, it's too coincidental, isn't it?

142
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,291
What is it?

143
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,591
The two cars that left the convenience store at almost the same time,

144
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,991
take separate roads

145
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,591
and a few minutes later, they collide here.

146
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,091
I wonder if it's really a coincidence?

147
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,091
I think it's just a casual coincidence.

148
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,591
If you like, would you like to go

149
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:29,391
and confirm at the convenience store?

150
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,991
Yes, he came at around 14:00.

151
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,557
He was acting strange,

152
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,791
so something bothered me.

153
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,791
Did you come yesterday, too, sir?

154
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,491
See, I remember that green car.

155
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
That's Kurumatani's car!

156
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,591
Don't mix things up!

157
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:56,575
He yelled at me.

158
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,991
No way.

159
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,579
He really said Kurumatani?

160
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,583
-Yes, sir. -Mr. Hayamizu knew Mr. Kurumatani.

161
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,091
Something smells.

162
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:09,691
Then...

163
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,391
How about this man?

164
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,291
He...

165
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,991
He was arguing with the young man

166
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:19,191
I was talking about a while ago.

167
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:20,591
I see.

168
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,391
I must've seen the two cars leave,

169
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,091
after they both got into an argument.

170
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,191
Soon after that, the accident occurred.

171
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,891
If I remember correctly, back then...

172
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:58,191
Here goes, Conan.

173
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,391
Okay.

174
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,591
Mr. Kurumatani.

175
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,991
You knew Mr. Hayamizu

176
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:10,649
who was riding the red car, didn't you?

177
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,391
Oh, well...

178
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,291
I've seen him around,

179
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,691
but I wasn't all that sure.

180
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:18,991
Then, what were arguing over

181
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:22,091
at the convenience store with Mr. Hayamizu?

182
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,391
The manager of the convenience store

183
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,665
saw you both arguing.

184
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,991
The fact is, that red foreign car is a second hand car

185
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:32,671
that my friend sold him three months ago.

186
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,491
When I asked him about the loan of the car

187
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,991
not being paid by the buyer,

188
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:40,679
he suddenly broke out in rage.

189
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:43,591
I see.

190
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:47,391
By the way, why did you come driving over this way?

191
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:50,689
You live in the opposite direction, don't you?

192
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:51,891
No special reason.

193
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:56,391
I was driving around because I had time to kill.

194
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,697
The rainbow was nice too.

195
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:02,391
Rainbow? I wonder if there was any rainbow.

196
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,991
What is it anyway, since a while ago?

197
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,091
Why are you talking about things

198
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:08,707
that have nothing to do with the accident?

199
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,491
I get it!

200
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:14,191
Mr. Kurumatani, you're an auto mechanic, aren't you?

201
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,991
Yes, I am.

202
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:20,291
You knew that this was a place

203
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,091
full of collisions beforehand.

204
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,891
No, I didn't.

205
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:25,891
Since you got into an argument with Mr. Hayazumi,

206
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:28,727
you rigged the brakes of his car

207
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,391
during the few minutes he was shopping in the convenience store.

208
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,731
You could probably do so hands down,

209
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,391
being that you're an auto mechanic.

210
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,191
That's why there were no traces of brakes

211
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:38,291
where the red foreign car was.

212
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,991
But, nothing abnormal was found

213
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:43,091
in the brakes of the red car.

214
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,391
Is that so?

215
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:49,291
But, I'll bet you stuck something in between the brake pedal.

216
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,751
It's an old trick that's used when you want to fake an accident.

217
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:58,091
You were planning to give Mr. Hayamizu a taste of his own medicine,

218
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,391
but it turned out into an accident you never imagined would happen,

219
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:01,491
and Mr. Hayamizu died.

220
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:04,763
That's why you wanted to hide the fact, isn't that right?

221
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,291
But nothing suspicious was found

222
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,791
inside the red car.

223
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,091
Mr. Detective!

224
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,791
Please cut out saying strange things!

225
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:22,781
Dad, don't smoke while you're walking!

226
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,783
There's an ashtray in the car too, isn't there?

227
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,291
Yeah.

228
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,791
Ashtray in the car?

229
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,391
I see.

230
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,891
So, that's the story.

231
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,770
What're you doing, Conan?

232
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,815
Nothing much.

233
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,370
The image on the surveillance camera for traffic is ready.

234
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,821
A surveillance camera here?

235
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,823
Because there are too many accidents.

236
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,370
I see.

237
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,070
Not for kids!

238
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,170
After the red foreign car entered the intersection

239
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,370
without braking at all,

240
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,841
the green car that came later crashed into it.

241
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,845
The green car crashed into the sign after that and stopped.

242
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,670
The red car fell into the irrigation channel.

243
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,870
There seems to be nothing suspicious about.

244
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,170
It seems to be so.

245
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,470
I guess there's no problem closing this case as an accident.

246
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,270
Darn.

247
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,865
I'd like to see the image on the surveillance camera.

248
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,570
Come on. Dad'll scold you if go here and there.

249
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,470
Huh?

250
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,270
Ran, excuse me a bit.

251
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,370
Conan.

252
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,470
Boy.

253
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:05,970
This is...

254
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,891
Ran.

255
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,470
You mean, Dad?

256
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,907
How was it?

257
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,770
Just as you said,

258
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,270
we think that it is an accident of two cars colliding.

259
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,270
Only, your ignoring to stop at the stop sign

260
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,917
is a grave offense.

261
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,919
I am very sorry.

262
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,170
So, the case is closed!

263
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,170
I'm counting on you, Ran.

264
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,670
I'm taking you back to the station

265
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,933
and interrogating you regarding the accident,

266
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,270
so please come with me.

267
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,670
All right.

268
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,270
Please wait.

269
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,945
This is not just a mere traffic accident,

270
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,070
but rather a planned homicide case.

271
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,670
What?

272
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,670
Just what do you mean?

273
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,970
It's not true that Mr. Kurumatani coincidentally happened

274
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,470
to run into Mr. Hayamizu at the convenience store.

275
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,270
Just... just what do you think you're saying?

276
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,370
Just a while ago,

277
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,270
the boy I came with saw the ashtray in your car,

278
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,070
and told me that it was full of cigarette butts.

279
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,971
That's strange,

280
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,470
because you don't seem to smoke.

281
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,870
Well, that's...

282
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,970
The brand name of that cigarette is called Paradise

283
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,470
and moreover, the filter of all the cigarette butts were bitten flat.

284
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,870
I mean it's the same as the cigarette butts that were thrown away

285
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,991
by Mr. Hayamizu in front of the convenience store.

286
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,570
In other words, Mr. Hayamizu drove the green car

287
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,270
up to that convenience store.

288
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,999
It's most likely that

289
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,170
you lent the green car to Mr. Hayamizu

290
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,870
while he was having his car tuned up at the factory.

291
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,470
And isn't it that you promised to meet Mr. Hayamizu

292
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,870
at the convenience store after tune-up was done

293
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,470
to exchange his car for the green car that you lent him?

294
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,017
Then you pretended to have a collision with Mr. Hayamizu

295
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,019
and killed him, right?

296
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,770
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

297
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,025
In other words, Mr. Kurumatani was planning

298
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:31,029
to collide with Mr. Hayamizu's car to begin with.

299
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,031
Don't be ridiculous!

300
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,470
I'm hurt too, you know!

301
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,370
One mistake, and I may have been dead too.

302
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,470
No worry about that with your car,

303
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,970
because it's equipped with iron pipe grill guard.

304
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,770
Getting hurt would make it look even more like an accident

305
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,049
and is better for you, isn't it?

306
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,670
Making up stories!

307
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,870
It's an accident that was caused by the collision course!

308
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,057
The fact that there were no traces of the other driver

309
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,070
stepping on the brakes is proof, isn't it?

310
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,270
True.

311
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,063
Mr. Mouri, I think it would be difficult

312
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,065
to cause this phenomenon deliberately.

313
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,870
The fact that Mr. Hayamizu didn't step on the brakes

314
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,870
is not because of the collision course phenomenon.

315
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,070
Mr. Kurumatani rigged it,

316
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,370
so that Mr. Hayamizu couldn't step on the gas.

317
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,070
But, they just said that the car wasn't rigged in any way just now.

318
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,570
The car wasn't.

319
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,070
Another place was rigged.

320
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,470
-Ran! -Oh, yes!

321
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,670
It's the same as a road sign

322
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,170
and reflective plate is pasted on it.

323
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,470
It is normally positioned,

324
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,570
so that it faces the direction in which Mr. Hayamizu's car came from

325
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,670
and it stands out when light is shined on it.

326
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,870
The glare does strain the eyes.

327
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,770
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Kurumatani

328
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,370
had changed the direction the sign faced beforehand.

329
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,770
If so, the light that reflects from the sign

330
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,125
will shine on Mr. Hayamizu's car.

331
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:11,129
I wonder why we didn't notice it

332
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,870
when we saw the image on the surveillance camera?

333
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,070
It was outside the visual range of the surveillance camera,

334
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,137
it wasn't in view.

335
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,770
After leaving the convenience store,

336
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,070
Mr. Hayamizu's car headed for this intersection

337
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,270
using the road alongside the irrigation channel.

338
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,670
At the intersection, he had the right of way,

339
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,770
so he drove straight without slowing down.

340
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,153
Just about that time,

341
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,670
the light that reflected on the sign,

342
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,670
was at an angle that shined a little

343
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,159
in the foreground of the intersection.

344
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,163
Not aware of this, Mr. Hayamizu approached the intersection.

345
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,770
What the...

346
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,770
Mr. Hayamizu was surprised at the blinding light

347
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,470
and failed to step on the brakes.

348
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,470
Moreover, because of the after image of the reflected light,

349
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,670
Mr. Kurumatani's car wasn't found.

350
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,570
He probably picked 14:00 as the time to meet at the convenience store,

351
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,770
taking into consideration the angle of the sun.

352
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,470
Could it be that he crashed into the sign

353
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,570
to cover up the fact that he changed directions?

354
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,570
It's most likely that you crashed into Mr. Hayamizu's car

355
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,470
on the driver's seat side.

356
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,570
I actually wanted to crash into that guy directly.

357
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,670
-Huh? -Hayamizu hit-and-run my little sister a year ago.

358
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,219
What?

359
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,370
Six months ago,

360
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,170
I realized when a red foreign car came in for a tune up.

361
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:51,229
Ever since then, all I thought about is avenging her death.

362
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,870
Hayamizu brought that car in again for a tune up.

363
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,470
That's why I planned what I did.

364
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,070
I urged him to turn himself into the police

365
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,570
when he came to return the car.

366
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,670
But, he insisted on playing dumb,

367
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,370
so I went on with my plan.

368
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,770
If he only turned himself in,

369
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,470
I would've at least spared him his life, that rat.

370
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,570
You're just as much a rat yourself

371
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,259
if you keep quiet about the fact

372
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,870
that you planned an accident to kill Mr. Hayamizu.

373
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,270
Now's your turn to turn yourself in.

374
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,170
Mr. Detective, when did you realize my scheme?

375
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,970
When you said you didn't notice the rainbow.

376
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,770
The collision course phenomenon cannot happen

377
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,570
unless the driver is looking ahead.

378
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,287
You didn't notice the rainbow,

379
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,289
because you were so absorbed in wanting to hit Mr. Hayamizu's car

380
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:54,770
that you were looking only to the side, isn't that right?

381
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,770
If you keep on harboring feelings of grudge and hate,

382
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,870
you'll lose sight of the beautiful things

383
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,870
right in front of your eyes.

384
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,870
Dad, it's dangerous to speed so much

385
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,270
when you didn't get enough sleep.

386
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,670
I'm fine. My head's cleared up.

387
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,870
I guess so, after all you did get some sleep.

388
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,370
We've got to return the rental car tonight

389
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,401
or we'll have to pay extension fee, don't we?

390
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,770
But, everything will be in vain if we get into an accident, you know.

391
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,070
I'm fine...

392
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,070
Besides, I've got a mahjong game tonight

393
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,411
and the prize is Yoko-chan's premium DVD!

394
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:56,670
I'll be there soon, Yoko-chan!

395
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,070
This is what you call, Kogoro phenomenon. He never learns.

396
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,980
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:06,780
"Dialect"

398
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,427
In the next episode Dr. Agasa and Ai are in big trouble.

399
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,429
-Kansai dialect? -Make sure you tune in next week too, okay?
