1
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:14,832
What? You're Kaneyama's punk friend?

2
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:16,632
"Onda Kazuyoshi (48)" -Did he tell you to make me come...

3
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,032
"Game Software Company President" -to a place like this?

4
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,332
"Oomine Ryosuke (24)" -Shut up!

5
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,832
Cut out your blabbering and give me all the money you got!

6
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:28,007
I'm paying Kanayama salary like I should.

7
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,732
But that's only chicken feed.

8
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:32,032
You should paid the equal amount of money

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,432
that is right for the work.

10
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:36,532
What you guys are doing is none other than mugging people.

11
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:39,132
I'm reporting you to the police!

12
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:45,532
What's wrong?

13
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:46,732
You're a 4th dan in Judo

14
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:50,632
and was even a candidate for the Olympics, weren't you?

15
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,832
Try sticking me out to the police!

16
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:56,432
You made a lot of dough

17
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,232
from the game software made by Kanayama, didn't you?

18
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:03,132
You can't even handle a computer yourself, and yet...

19
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:04,832
you go ahead and make a profit of 20 billion yen.

20
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,632
What does Kanayama get, just a mere 100,000 yen?

21
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:09,532
Talk about ridiculous!

22
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:11,832
No, you see the company

23
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:15,432
also invested quite a lot to the development of the game.

24
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:18,432
Shut up! Miser!

25
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:59,332
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

26
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:01,632
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

27
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:03,332
A kidnapper that's a bit dense.

28
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,532
Held as hostage, what goes with my fate?

29
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:07,132
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:08,932
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,932
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:58,008
"Two Days with the Culprit (1st Day)"

33
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,408
"Mix Mall"

34
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:07,508
"Cream Heaven"

35
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:10,808
We're lucky to have you around!

36
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:14,008
Yes, really. Thanks to you, Conan.

37
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,508
We get to eat the Dragon Mountain Parfait of Creamy Heaven...

38
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,908
"Kid's Service for those..." -with a 20 percent discount.

39
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,808
"who bring along an elementary student" -We're sure lucky.

40
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,308
I'm unlucky

41
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:27,408
because I wanted to watch the soccer game on TV.

42
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:32,251
The toy department is over there!

43
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,608
Don't go too far!

44
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,808
Just come back before we finish eating!

45
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:51,008
Yes, that's right.

46
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,808
There's probably no doubt that it's Oomine.

47
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:56,608
It seems that he's taken a child hostage.

48
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:58,277
Please save Kayoko.

49
00:04:58,277 --> 00:04:59,908
Please.

50
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,808
We give you our word that we'll save her.

51
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:07,008
The girl that's been taken hostage is 5 years old Kayoko Yuuki.

52
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,708
Yes, we'll be careful.

53
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,208
Because it seems as if he's armed with a gun.

54
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,408
Please come along with us, Mrs. Yuuki.

55
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:17,008
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,908
A child's been taken hostage.

57
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,708
The kidnapper's armed with a gun.

58
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:37,908
If the kidnapper tries to escape from the shopping mall...

59
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,608
he could only do so by car.

60
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:55,908
Ran, that brat would never get lost.

61
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,508
True.

62
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:59,208
Inspector Megure?

63
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,108
This is Mrs. Natsumi Yuuki, the mother of Kayoko

64
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:05,508
that is being held hostage.

65
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:07,608
If he were to get hold of a car,

66
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,008
it would be a place where people wouldn't see him.

67
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,808
Like behind a pillar,

68
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:15,608
and some place far away from the entrance.

69
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,608
It's Kayoko that's being held hostage.

70
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,108
I'm borrowing your car!

71
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,108
What are you doing?

72
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,395
Here we go!

73
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,008
Stay still.

74
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,108
Kayoko!

75
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,508
There he is!

76
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,508
Oomine is in the parking lot!

77
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,808
Come, hurry!

78
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,908
You brat!

79
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,108
Conan?

80
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,808
Darn.

81
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,908
Okay... you're fine now!

82
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:28,427
Oomine! Throw your gun down and turn yourself in!

83
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:31,108
You can't get away!

84
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,808
Don't dare move, you brat!

85
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,435
First I've got to check if he's armed with a gun,

86
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,708
or it's too dangerous for me to do anything.

87
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,608
Oomine's in the parking lot!

88
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,457
All of you block the entrance and exit!

89
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,108
I wonder what it is?

90
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,408
Talk about junk driver!

91
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,108
Halt! Police!

92
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,108
Out of the way! Stupid!

93
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:27,108
It's dangerous, please get out of the way!

94
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,808
Conan?

95
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,108
The life of the hostage is top priority!

96
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:41,008
-Copy? -Yes, sir!

97
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:50,308
Dad! Conan's in big trouble!

98
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:56,308
Junk driver!

99
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,808
You're a hostage, so stop acting so haughty, brat!

100
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:00,908
Up ahead!

101
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,208
What?

102
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:12,908
And, the next news is...

103
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,535
That's...

104
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,308
Is it Oomine?

105
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,908
How dare he...

106
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,543
Inspector Megure!

107
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,008
Chiba?

108
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,308
We've safely rescued Kayoko.

109
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:32,551
However, please stay calm.

110
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,908
Conan's being...

111
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,808
Conan's being held hostage!

112
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:40,559
I found out quite a while ago!

113
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,908
You guys hurry up and come over here and join us!

114
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,565
It looks like he got away, did he?

115
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,308
Yes, looks like he did.

116
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,571
Last night, the president of a company,

117
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,008
Mr. Kazuyoshi was found murdered in a park in Shibuya ward.

118
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:57,408
The prime suspect is

119
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:59,908
Ryosuke Oomine, 25 years old.

120
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:01,308
-Idiot! -He is now on the wanted list.

121
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,408
-I'm still 24! -Oomine seems to have

122
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:06,308
taken a boy hostage at the shopping mall in Haido cho,

123
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:08,608
and is now on the run.

124
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,589
There's strong possibility that

125
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,708
he is armed with a gun...

126
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,608
Are you a murderer, mister?

127
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,308
Yeah, did it bugs you?

128
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:24,603
Of course it bugs me. Give me a break.

129
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,608
Did you said Conan's been kidnapped?

130
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:30,308
I'm sorry, despite me being with him...

131
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:32,611
Which way did his car go?

132
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:36,008
I'd advise you not to get involved this time.

133
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:37,708
Inspector.

134
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,208
Oomine who kidnapped Conan

135
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,408
is a punk who loiters around the Shinjuku area.

136
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,508
He has a record and has been arrested twice

137
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:47,808
on charges of mugging, battery and assault.

138
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:49,408
Mr. Onda who was murdered

139
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:52,008
is the president of a major game software company,

140
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:55,608
a successful man who has an annual income of a several million yen.

141
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:58,008
But, he was plagued with money trouble

142
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,108
because he paid his employees extremely low salaries

143
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:03,508
and failed to pay his suppliers as well.

144
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,208
Oomine had heard of President Onda's

145
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,649
dictator-like actions from his colleague, Mr. Kanayama

146
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,108
who was working at the company.

147
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:17,408
It seems that Oomine was angered at Onda's ways

148
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,808
and tried to take money from him,

149
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,408
but inadvertently shot him.

150
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:24,208
All of what happened

151
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,708
was found in the surveillance camera set up in the park.

152
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:33,908
It is very likely that Oomine is still armed with a gun.

153
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:36,408
Leave everything to us this time.

154
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:39,408
We've already set up cordon too.

155
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,208
Conan.

156
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,491
We're staying here for a while.

157
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:04,691
Let me go home already.

158
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,891
You don't need me anymore.

159
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,391
If I let you go,

160
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:12,291
you're going to tell the officers about me, right?

161
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,291
No, I won't.

162
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,591
I know you'll tell them!

163
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,717
Do I look like I'll do something like that?

164
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,491
Yep.

165
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,191
I'll have to check

166
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,991
whether he has a gun on him or not.

167
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:31,791
After that, I either grasp the chance to knock him down or flee.

168
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,739
He abandoned the car here?

169
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:42,291
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,191
He's either hiding somewhere around here

171
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:47,891
or used this place as a relay station and fled.

172
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,191
-Search the vicinity thoroughly! -Yes, sir.

00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,091
In the papers about 2 months ago, I'm sure that

177
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:08,391
there was an article special on Mr. Onda's company.

If he doesn't have a gun...

00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,791
Come.

206
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,191
It should be this room.

Hurry up and get inside.

211

Bingo. I can get outside from there.

Do you know the person that fired the gun?

214
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:50,929
Of course not.

215
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,491
Then, who was it?

216
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:54,933
How did he know you were there?

217
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,935
And besides, why did he fire the gun?

218

How should I know?

219

Hurry up and come.

220
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:14,491
It seems that the guy gave up.

221
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:16,955
He gave up quite easily.

222
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,491
Besides, what was that explosive sound?

223
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,971
Why didn't you say anything?

224
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,791
The guy that just passed by is a police officer, right?

225
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,591
Since you're a hostage,

226
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:40,979
if you see an officer, you'd try to ask for help, right?

227
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:41,891
Really?

228
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:43,791
That's only natural, right?

229
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,985
But why did you risk getting shot to protect me?

230
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,391
You could've fled alone.

231

That's true.

232
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,291

Are you really a murderer?

I'm the one who shot him, so there's no doubt about it!

You don't look like that kind of a character, though.

The child that Oomine took hostage

253
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:21,491
is the boy staying at your place, isn't he?

254
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,591
Oomine hasn't been arrested yet

255
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:27,085
and I guess as the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

256
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:31,391
you'd like to find Oomine yourself, wouldn't you?

257
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:36,591
If so, he would first come to my place.

258
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:39,491
That's the only natural way to think, right?

259
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,891
You seem to be Oomine's colleague.

260
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:47,105
He was my classmate during my intermediate school days in Morioka.

261
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,691
And, I used to meet him now and then, even after coming to Tokyo.

262
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:53,891
Oomine tried to take money from Mr. Onda for you

263
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:56,291
and ended up doing what he did.

264
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,491
As to that, I do feel bad.

265
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:03,991
Because I did bad mouth the president.

266

I said that he only paid cheap salary despite making a big profit.

267
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,091
Just because he was strong at judo, he was tyrannical

268
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:13,591
and resorted to violence for almost everything.

269
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,891
The president was really sly.

270
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:18,191
He used to take millions of yen.

271
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,137
I developed the game software

272
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,141

do something like that?

284
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:58,291
You used to call him "daddy"

285
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,191
and sucked a lot of cash out of him, didn't you?

286
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:04,591
You mean you're sulky because I brushed you off?

Well, who cares.

288

doing chat from the company.

290

That's none of your business!

I think you should suspect Momoko.

292

She's Mr. Onda's secretary.

293

Is there anyone else?

298

Bullied? In other words, power harassment?

299

If I were him, I would've quit the company long ago.

300

Well, if there were to be an accomplice,

I think this is about it.

302

There's another major figure left, isn't there?

303

You, Mr. Kanayama.

Hey, watch your step.

305
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,791
Did you hear something just now?

306
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,791
Over that way.

307
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,791
You go around from that side.

308
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,091
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,259
I can't afford to make him get caught just yet.

310
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,891
Hurry and hide.

311
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,691
Quick.

312
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,791
That was dangerous!

Is that you, Dr. Agasa?

314

Oh, well, you see...

316
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:07,791
An emergency. I'm very much in a rush.

317
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,791
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:14,191
So, I've got to go. Bye.

319
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:23,691
No need to worry anymore.

320

Thank you, Doc.

321
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,325
You're a life saver.

322
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:32,691
Right, nothing will be solved if he gets caught now.

323
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:36,791
I have a feeling there's something more behind this case.

327
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:09,920
-What are you doing? -Wiping the window.
