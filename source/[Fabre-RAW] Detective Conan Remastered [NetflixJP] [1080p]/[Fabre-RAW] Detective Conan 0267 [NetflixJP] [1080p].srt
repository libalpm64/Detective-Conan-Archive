1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,170
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,270
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,870
Valentine's Day is coming up soon.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,870
Both love and the case get to the core.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,670
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,980
We all came to a lodge called Suito Mountain Lodge

9
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,380
located in a remote mountain area

10
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,780
together with Sonoko who invited us.

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
However, one of the guests staying at the lodge,

12
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
a journalist named Yoshitaka Nigaki

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,280
fails to return to the lodge after going inte the woods

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,280
despite a violent blizzard.

15
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,180
After a while of searching for Mr. Nigaki in the woods,

16
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,780
we found him dead.

17
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,580
Blood stains that have been wiped off.

18
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,880
Goggles that were replaced on him.

19
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,980
And Ms. Ako's chocolate.

20
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,480
Why did the killer go out of the way

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,380
to bring Ako's chocolate out of the kitchen?

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,880
Why?

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,580
"Bloody Valentine (The Deduction)"

24
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
I see.

25
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,780
I understand.

26
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,780
So, what did they say?

27
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,380
Did the police say they'll be right over?

28
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,680
An avalanche is a lie, right?

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,180
No. There seems have been an avalanche at around 8pm

30
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,480
and the tunnel seems to be blocked off.

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,180
They say they don't know

32
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,680
when they'll be able to come here until tomorrow.

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
It's just as I said!

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,980
How was the chocolate?

35
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,980
Ako's chocolate was gone after all.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,080
Darn it!

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,280
I brought back Mr. Nigaki's camera and video camera

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,380
thinking that we could get some clues,

39
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,680
but the video tape is unused.

40
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,180
The only clue we have left now

41
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,480
is the used roll of film that is left inside his camera.

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,580
But if the forensic officers can't come,

43
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,680
we can't develop the film.

44
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,780
Oh, I can develop and print the picture

45
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,480
if you want me to.

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
Since Mr. Nigaki said that he wanted to see the pictures

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,280
right away after he took pictures of them,

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
I brought a set of the necessary equipments.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,680
Let me use your bathroom, okay?

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,480
It's just right to use for a dark room.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Yes, go ahead.

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,480
I'll help you, then.

53
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,980
Hey, was that all that was inside?

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,480
Weren't there any more films or tapes

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,280
in the knapsack of the guy who was killed?

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,580
Yes, there were.

57
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,180
But the films and tapes were all unopened.

58
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,480
Which means that the guy was killed

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,280
before he filmed anything on video?

60
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,480
Or maybe Mr. Nigaki preferred taking pictures

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,180
rather than filming videos.

62
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,980
That's not true!

63
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,680
He preferred filming videos rather than taking pictures.

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,080
He was filming a lot last night, too.

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,780
Can you show us that video tape, then?

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,880
Okay.

67
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,730
But there are a lot of it in his bag,

68
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,030
so I don't know if we can tell which one is last night's video.

69
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,730
Forget it, kid!

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,630
Let's not watch the video a dead man took.

71
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,530
Did he film something he shouldn't have?

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,030
That's not what he meant.

73
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,230
It's kind of creepie.

74
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,730
Why don't we all watch it together in the living room?

75
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,130
Okay.

76
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,130
If we watch it together we may be able to find a clue.

77
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,930
I'll go get it from his room then.

78
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,530
Gosh.

79
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,730
Is this the love chocolate you're going to give me?

80
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,630
Wrong! This is for me!

81
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,930
Hey, don't tell me you're giving it to someone else?

82
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,630
It could be.

83
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,530
It sure is no fun watching

84
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,430
somebody elses' home video after all.

85
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,880
I'm going to make your chocolate with the girls

86
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,480
that are coming to spend the night here tomorrow.

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
Why are you keeping me in suspense for?

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,980
I've got a super gift for you too, you know.

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Darn it! This stupid TV...

90
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,480
Come on!

91
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,180
Sorry that it's a stupid TV.

92
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,580
This is a treasure that my husband bought

93
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,380
for the first time with Reiko.

94
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,180
Reiko?

95
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,980
She was my husband's first wife.

96
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,880
I was told that she died 12 years ago because of an illness.

97
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,180
Hey, Saburo!

98
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,680
It's time for you to go back to your cage already.

99
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,780
So, she's the second wife.

100
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,080
I've heard about them from the previous owner, too.

101
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,880
This granny came to spend the night here

102
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,380
just when he was depressed after having lost his wife.

103
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,280
Then, they hit it off right from the start

104
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,580
and got married just like that.

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,880
Granny's sweets were highly reputable

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,280
and this lodge was going well for a while.

107
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,780
But I guess it's tough without husband after all.

108
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,480
You heard about this before, you said?

109
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,180
That means you both come here a lot?

110
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,980
Nope, just once in the past.

111
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,580
By the way,

112
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,080
is that the last of the four video tapes we watched?

113
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,580
Yes.

114
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,480
That's all of the videos with yesterday's date on it.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Okay, so there's only so much left of this video tape!

116
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,180
I'm going to challenge making chocolate

117
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,980
for the first time in my life starting now.

118
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
-So goodbye, everyone. -Goodbye!

119
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,880
Good grief, it's finally ended.

120
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,280
You two don't seem to have been in the video?

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,480
Well, of course. I just got here this morning.

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,280
I just got here a while ago.

123
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,280
So, we're back to where we started.

124
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,880
We've figured out what time Mr. Nigaki was killed, though!

125
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,180
Take a look at this picture.

126
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,080
It's a picture that was taken when he was punched.

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Huh? How can you tell?

128
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,380
Do you see this blurred shadow?

129
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,080
It's not in any of the other pictures,

130
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,680
just this last one.

131
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,080
This is the shadow formed by blood stains on the camera lens.

132
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,880
The shutter probably went off accidentally

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,580
after he was punched and fell to the ground from the shock.

134
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,580
But you can't really tell if those are blood stains yet.

135
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,080
There's no mistake about it.

136
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
We put film in his camera and tried it out,

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,180
and got the exact same result.

138
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,080
Which means he was killed during the day time.

139
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,880
Something's not right.

140
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Ms. Mika's explanation doesn't make sense.

141
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,580
In other words, the killer

142
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,780
may be among the three of you

143
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,380
who were not at the ledge with us during that time.

144
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,480
Hey!

145
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,980
Then, what's with that chocolate?

146
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,280
It was here at the lodge until 8:00 at night, wasn't it?

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,380
Just who brought it out then?

148
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,480
In the first place,

149
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,680
what stupid person would go back out

150
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,180
into the blizzard just to put the chocolate near the corpse?

151
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,880
Well, that's true.

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
It could be that...

153
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,680
It might really exists.

154
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,580
A being living in this mountain other than us.

155
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,280
What do you mean?

156
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,880
Come to think of it, before I met all of you here,

157
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,580
I ran into a queer guy in the woods.

158
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,480
A huge guy wearing a black knitted cap!

159
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,280
I mistook him for a bear and almost shot him.

160
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,880
A black knitted cap?

161
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,080
It can't be...

162
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,380
Don't tell me that...

163
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,230
A man wearing black knitted cap.

164
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,030
Don't tell me that it's him.

165
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,830
Excuse me.

166
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,930
The person you saw in the woods.

167
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,030
Do you remember what he looked like?

168
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,230
I may know him.

169
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,530
I wonder.

170
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,030
I could tell that he was a man from his physique.

171
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,030
But he had goggles and a muffler on,

172
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,030
so I didn't get to see his face at all.

173
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,430
I see.

174
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,830
Ran?

175
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,730
It could've been Natsuya.

176
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,430
I'm sure it was him.

177
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,130
It's Natsuya!

178
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,530
He was alive after all.

179
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,830
Let's go and get him.

180
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,030
Mika.

181
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,130
No way!

182
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,930
You can't go out in this blizzard!

183
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,730
Natsuya is waiting for us in the woods.

184
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,930
Natsuya's waiting.

185
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,030
Natsuya died!

186
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,630
He died in the avalanche four years ago!

187
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,030
Sorry.

188
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,430
I'm sorry, Mika.

189
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,330
Who is Natsuya?

190
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,730
He's my older brother whose whereabouts have been unknown

191
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,230
since four years ago.

192
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,730
Mika was going steady with him.

193
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,430
So, the checkered chocolate

194
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,830
that Ms. Mika was making this afternoon was...

195
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,530
Yes, we were going to take the chocolate to his grave

196
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,030
because he liked checkered patterns.

197
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,230
My brother grave is also in the woods

198
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,330
beside the graves of the previous owner and his first wife.

199
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,130
Not only the graves of the three are here.

200
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,430
In this forest,

201
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,130
there are the graves of those who have died in this mountain

202
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,030
whose identities are unknown.

203
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:34,030
But all the graves except the three graves were all destroyed

204
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,030
by wild animals.

205
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,030
Why are only the three graves left undestroyed?

206
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,830
Probably because I pay visit to them everyday with Saburo.

207
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,130
Just like my husband used to when he was alive.

208
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,830
Well, but if you insist that someone other than us

209
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,330
are in the mountains...

210
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,130
The guy wearing the black knitted cap

211
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,630
roaming around in the woods is definitely the killer.

212
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,030
What do you mean?

213
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,330
I have no idea when that guy called Nigaki was killed.

214
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,430
But the person who left the chocolate next to him

215
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,130
is the killer, right?

216
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,530
All six of you left the chocolate in the kitchen

217
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,230
and went out at 8pm to look for Nigaki, right?

218
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,030
If everyone found the chocolate together,

219
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,530
it's impossible for me to put the chocolate there.

220
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,830
I met all six of you near the lodge.

221
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,930
It was probably right after you all left the lodge

222
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,430
to look for Nigaki.

223
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,130
It would take 20 minutes to get from the lodge

224
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,630
to the site of the crime which is the woods,

225
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,530
no matter how much I rush.

226
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,730
So, I would have no time to put the chocolate there.

227
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,830
And of course, I wouldn't have been able to do it either.

228
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,730
At around 8pm, I was far away

229
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:49,030
from the lodge watching the tunnel get buried under the avalanche.

230
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,430
But you could've heard about the avalanche on the radio news.

231
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,930
No.

232
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,030
Because the avalanche was announced just about the same time

233
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,830
we got back to the lodge and called the police.

234
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,630
Well, the only one who could've brought the chocolate

235
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,630
is that lady there who was making the chocolate.

236
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,630
Huh?

237
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,730
I heard that before everybody went out together,

238
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,330
you and the other lady left together to look for the guy, right?

239
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,230
You two weren't together all the while, were you?

240
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,530
No, we split up part way and searched for him.

241
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,730
If you made similar type of chocolate the night before,

242
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,930
you could've placed the chocolate near Nigaki

243
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,030
when you went out the first time.

244
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,230
If you secretly took the chocolate

245
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,330
that you made today together with you

246
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,430
when you went out to search with everybody else,

247
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,530
you could make it look as if the killer took it.

248
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,730
Oh, no.

249
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,130
That's impossible!

250
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,530
There was a blizzard outside already

251
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,330
when we went to look for him the first time.

252
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,430
If he was killed then,

253
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,930
there should be snow in this picture

254
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,630
that was taken at the time of the crime, right?

255
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,030
What about the chocolate?

256
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,030
Why don't you compare them, then?

257
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,830
I took a picture of all the chocolate that everybody made today.

258
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,030
If you take a close look,

259
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,930
the chocolate that was found at the crime scene is a bit melted

260
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,730
and dented slightly out of shape.

261
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,930
I would sure like to meet the person

262
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,230
who can shape the letters exactly the same like this

263
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,330
as well as insert it onto the chocolate so much alike as it is.

264
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,330
What she's saying is that your deductions are off.

265
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,030
Right. Well, that's for the better, isn't it?

266
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,430
Now that we know the killer isn't among us,

267
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,030
I can sleep without worrying, then.

268
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,530
Goodnight then, everybody.

269
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,030
Which means...

270
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,130
the killer is the man wearing the black knitted cap.

271
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,830
The film that was inside Mr. Nigaki's camera,

272
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,230
are you sure the pictures are the ones

273
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,330
that were taken by Mr. Nigaki yesterday and today?

274
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,330
What?

275
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,930
Because it was already used, wasn't it?

276
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,730
It could've been inserted some time later, right?

277
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,130
Then, would you like to look

278
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,430
and compare the other pictures in this film?

279
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,430
The video that he filmed yesterday is also here.

280
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,130
The clothing of the three are all the same

281
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,730
in the pictures and the video.

282
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,630
And of course, Mr. Nigaki who is taking the pictures and filming

283
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,230
is virtually not included.

284
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,230
Moreover, most of the pictures were taken at night.

285
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,130
The fact that at the end of this film

286
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,030
there was that blood stained picture

287
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,030
means the pictures were taken this afternoon, doesn't it?

288
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,130
Nobody's gone outside

289
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,630
since we arrived at the lodge yesterday

290
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,630
to the time he left with his camera this afternoon.

291
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,030
Which means that he's the only one who could've take the picture.

292
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,730
Well, the only other possibility

293
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,130
is that some trick is used when developing films.

294
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,830
How could I have done something like that?

295
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,530
Ran was with me right through while I was developing the films.

296
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,130
Right?

297
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,930
Yes, she didn't do anything strange.

298
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,030
Besides, she even used a glove

299
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,430
when taking the film out of the camera

300
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,930
so that there wouldn't be her fingerprints on the films.

301
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,930
Moreover, if you look at the negative,

302
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,030
I'm sure you can see that nothing was done to it.

303
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,230
Right, if there was anything strange,

304
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,030
there was a picture that was completely black.

305
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,830
Completely black?

306
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,730
There were two of them

307
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,130
just before the picture with blood stains on them.

308
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,930
Pictures that were completely black and you couldn't see anything.

309
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,130
Really?

310
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,530
I think the shutter just accidentally went off

311
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,830
when something was over the lens covering it.

312
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,830
Just as I thought.

313
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,630
The picture with the blood stain on it is a trick after all.

314
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,130
But I can't figure it out.

315
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,180
How can you take a picture like that?

316
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,780
And what baffles me more

317
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,780
the chocolate that was by the corpse.

318
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,980
Putting something like that there would nullify the trick.

319
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,130
Hey, Saburo.

320
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,130
-It's your favorite ball. -Don't tell me that the killer...

321
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,830
is actually that man wearing the black knitted cap

322
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,530
who is hiding in the woods?

323
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,430
Huh? Strange.

324
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,930
When I came last year, you loved playing with the ball.

325
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,530
Why is the name of that dog is Saburo?

326
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,930
Because before him, there was a Taro and Jiro.

327
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,630
But they both died.

328
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,830
Huh? They died?

329
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,830
Yes, Taro was the name of my husband.

330
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,330
It seems that Jiro was a Shikoku dog just like Saburo.

331
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,130
But after the death of his first wife,

332
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,930
it seems to have died as if going after her.

333
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,130
I want to see he picture of that dog named Jiro.

334
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,730
I think I can find pictures of Jiro in my husband's album.

335
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,730
If I remember correctly,

336
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,030
Mr. Nigaki was using my husband's room.

337
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,830
Would you like me to go and get it?

338
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,030
I'll go with you then.

339
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,830
Does Saburo have some odd habits or something?

340
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,630
Like going out on walks a lot and stuff like that?

341
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,930
Nope, he usually stays inside the lodge.

342
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,230
The only time he goes out

343
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,330
is when he comes along to the grave with me.

344
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,630
He's a smart dog.

345
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,030
When we get near the grave, he runs ahead of me

346
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,230
and waits for me in front of the grave.

347
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,330
Come to think of it,

348
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,930
when there is a blizzard and he can't go out,

349
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,930
he doesn't eat his dog food.

350
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,330
Although he usually eats it on regular days.

351
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,630
Well, but on the day after the blizzard,

352
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,430
he seems back to his normal self and pigs out on the food.

353
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,230
Isn't that Ms. Ako's voice?

354
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,530
What's the matter?

355
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,530
Talk about rude!

356
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,830
They were in here going through Mr. Nigaki's things!

357
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,830
What?

358
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,630
Oh, no. It's not what it looks to be.

359
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,130
We just thought there may be clues to solving the case.

360
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,430
We didn't take anything.

361
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,030
All right. I guess I'll have to body check you.

362
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
Okay.

363
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Let's go to the room over there.

364
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
A blood stained parker?

365
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,280
The blood stains are not on the stomach area.

366
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,580
Oh, that's the parker

367
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,980
that Mr. Nigaki was wearing when he got hurt.

368
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,080
Huh? He got hurt?

369
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,780
He hurt his left hand thumb

370
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,980
when he was dicing chocolate with a knife.

371
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,380
It wasn't much of a wound,

372
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,980
but he was surprised and flung his hand around

373
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,880
so the blood splattered onto his parker, too.

374
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,480
Granny rushed to get he first aid box,

375
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,780
but accidentally dropped it.

376
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,080
Ako who worried about him breaks out in tears.

377
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,580
It was a total mess, with me holding him down

378
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,380
from going wild and all.

379
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,980
Well, the worst part

380
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,980
was looking after Ako who got super depressed after that.

381
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,180
Right?

382
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,380
Here it is!

384
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,280
I found it!

385
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,480
See, the dog to the left is Jiro

386
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,880
and the dog to the right is Saburo.

387
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,680
He's wearing a medal he was awarded by the prefecture

388
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,280
when he rescued a person who got into an accident in the mountains.

389
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,080
I wonder if the one to the left is Saburo

390
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,480
and the one to the right is Jiro.

391
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,480
Just as I thought.

392
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,080
I've figured out the case.

393
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,280
Now I know why there were black pictures taken

394
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,880
before the blood stained picture,

395
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,980
who took the chocolate out

396
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,980
and why it was put near the corpse.

397
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,480
Also, the person who killed Mr. Nigaki.

398
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,180
That is...

399
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,680
That person!

400
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,400
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,460
"Completely black photo"
