1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,470
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,470
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,070
Hattori Heiji has returned.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,370
He solves a mystery with Jodie.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,170
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,110
What?

9
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,610
All the investigation records of the cases that

10
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,710
Detective Mouri helped solve,

11
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,910
were stolen from the Metropolitan Police?

12
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,910
Yeah.

13
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,310
Did Officer Takagi really say that?

14
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,610
Not so loud.

15
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,610
Hey, don't tell me that the thieves are...

16
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,210
Yeah, maybe they had a hand in this.

17
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,610
If they heard rumors that I, who was supposed to have been dead

18
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,810
by that drug, am still alive,

19
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,110
and if they noticed something suspicious

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,610
about Kogoro Mouri's deductions,

21
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,410
it's possible.

22
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,310
And if someone among the men in black found out that

23
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,610
Shinichi Kudo was advising Kogoro Mouri...

24
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,310
Well, my disappearance

25
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,710
coincided with the time when "Sleeping Kogoro" started,

26
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,110
so it wouldn't surprise me if they thought it strange.

27
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,910
Yet, rumors are rumors. Don't worry.

28
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,410
Shinichi Kudo isn't around anymore.

29
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,310
And no one could imagine that the drug shrank me

30
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,810
and that I'm still solving cases by, putting Pops to sleep.

31
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,910
Even if they did see me going around solving cases

32
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,610
behind the scenes,

33
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,910
they'd only think of me as a super smart kid for my age.

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,410
Besides, it hasn't been determined that

35
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,310
they're the ones who stole the records yet.

36
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,310
Yeah, but...

37
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,710
Oh, well, it's definite that someone is spying on Pops.

38
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,310
Just in case, I have a favor to ask you, Doc.

39
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,610
You use me when you want and then you ignore me.

40
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,310
Why don't you go ask someone more reliable than me, huh?

41
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,310
So, are you mad that I didn't tell you about the stolen records?

42
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,610
Humph!

43
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,810
Hey, don't be mad at me, Doc.

44
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,410
I can't help it

45
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,010
because she was there at the time.

46
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,610
She? You mean Ai?

47
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,910
Yeah. If she knew that

48
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,210
somebody was snooping something around here,

49
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,310
I'm sure she would refuse to go out again.

50
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,910
That's why I gave her my word

51
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,610
and told her not to worry, because I'd would do everything I could

52
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,410
to help her if things start looking bad.

53
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,510
So you see, I can't have worrying.

54
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,710
Now, where's Haibara?

55
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,810
In the lab downstairs, I think.

56
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,010
Anyway, don't let her know about this.

57
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,810
She's not as tough as she pretends to be.

58
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,910
Idiot.

59
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,810
"English Teacher vs. Great Western Detective"

60
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,410
"(Part 1)"

61
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,210
But there's something I don't get.

62
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,510
What is it?

63
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,510
The guy who stole the files

64
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,810
sent everything back to the Metropolitan Police,

65
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,410
in a sealed envelope.

66
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,310
Well, the culprit probably returned the files

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,310
because he or she already finished examining them.

68
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,210
That's nuts. If they finished examining the files,

69
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,010
then why didn't they just throw them away?

70
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,110
Why would they go out of their way to send the files back

71
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,010
and breed more suspicion?

72
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,410
That's true.

73
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,710
The most possible explanation is that

74
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,710
they trying to relay a defiant message,

75
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,910
"We're already on to all your tricks."

76
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,110
Or...

77
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,510
They're trying to lure someone out.

78
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,110
Well, in this case, the person they are trying to lure out is...

79
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,410
Kudo, you, that is.

80
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,110
Yeah. Most likely.

81
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,810
What I don't get is if it's really a trap,

82
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,110
then why are they doing it in such a complicated way?

83
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,410
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,410
There're a lot of ways to lure someone out...

85
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,910
What... why are you doing here, Hattori?

86
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,210
This old man called me,

87
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,110
saying that if I, your best friend, came,

88
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,310
I could help you.

89
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,410
Well, I was under the impression that

90
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,010
Shinichi was burdened with something

91
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,510
he had a hard time finding a way out from.

92
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,510
But I guess we're dealing with something similar to grasping clouds,

93
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,810
so there's not much we can do.

94
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,110
Wrong, old man.

95
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,410
Why do you think Kudo came to tell you such an important thing,

96
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,510
which he hadn't told you until now?

97
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,410
He came here either because he found

98
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,710
a very important piece of information,

99
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,310
or because he has found a way to counter-attack them.

100
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,510
Hey, correct? Say something, will you?

101
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,910
You face is telling me that I hit the mark.

102
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,710
Well, do you remember I told you before,

103
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,810
that I had a brush with them at Haido City Hotel?

104
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,810
Yeah. You went there with that little girl named Haibara

105
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,510
and hunted down the old man named Pisco, right?

106
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,910
That's right.

107
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,110
I've been wondering for a while.

108
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,810
Why did Pisco have the handkerchief of the party,

109
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,710
which he wasn't supposed to have,

110
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,610
when he was questioned at the police station?

111
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,110
There were 7 suspects detained for questioning by the police.

112
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,310
Of course, Pisco didn't think that his handkerchief

113
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,810
would be checked by the police.

114
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,310
That means...

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,110
An accomplice.

116
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,010
Someone among the other six suspect,

117
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,610
who knew that he was gonna be checked first,

118
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,610
secretly gave Pisco the handkerchief.

119
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,910
Besides Pisco, the other six suspects were

120
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,510
Mika Nanjo, Yasuo Mihei, Yoshiharu Tahara,

121
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,610
Naoya Tarumi, Naomichi Mugikura and Chris Vineyard.

122
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,810
All six of them are celebrities who appear frequently on the media.

123
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,210
But there is one person

124
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,310
who announced taking a break from work, and disappeared

125
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,110
since that case.

126
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,910
And that is...

127
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,410
Chris Vineyard.

128
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,510
The American movie star.

129
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,810
Chris? The second generation actress?

130
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,810
Oh, that clever and beautiful actress with big boobs?

131
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,610
Yeah, the only child of the famous actress, Sharon Vineyard.

132
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,910
I checked on a lot of things, but, she's the most suspicious.

133
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,010
I didn't want to think so though.

134
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,710
So, I want to ask a favor of you, Doc.

135
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,410
What is it?

136
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,110
An internet address?

137
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,110
Yeah.

138
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,610
It's a website uploaded by fervent fans of hers

139
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,510
wanting her to come back.

140
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,910
Can you access the site and gather information?

141
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,610
Her biographical data, interests or habits.

142
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,510
Any hot topics, anything that her fans know about her.

143
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,410
Going to the Internet Cafe any more than

144
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,110
I already have, as a kid, checking out foreign websites

145
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,510
is going to make people suspicious of me.

146
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,010
Okay, I'll try,

147
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,610
but what're you gonna do with all the information?

148
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,610
Well, it may come in handy one day.

149
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,310
You have somebody, don't you?

150
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,710
There's a suspicious foreign woman around you.

151
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,310
Don't be silly. No way.

152
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,810
No joke?

153
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,710
Hey. Are you talking about Jodie, the teacher?

154
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,310
Jodie?

155
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,710
Who's she?

156
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,910
She's...

157
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,810
She's a newly appointed English teacher at Ran's high school.

158
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,410
A newly appointed English teacher?

159
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,410
Idiot. If you tell him things like that...

160
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,910
All right. Let's go to her house.

161
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,710
I knew it.

162
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,110
Do you know where she lives?

163
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,510
Well, we can ask Ran.

164
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:44,010
If things go well, we might get that medicine called Ahotoxin.

165
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,110
It's Apotoxin.

166
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,310
I'll bet you think those guys are no big deal.

167
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,410
You can stay here and not go if you don't want to.

168
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,810
What the...

169
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,410
What a tall building.

170
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,610
Are all English teachers really that rich?

171
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,610
I remember hearing from Ran that her parents are very rich.

172
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,410
Okay, it's Room 4 on the 21st floor.

173
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,410
That way.

174
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,510
Here. Jodie Saintemillion.

175
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,010
All right, Hattori.

176
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,910
You are here only to gather information today.

177
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,710
Don't get funny, now.

178
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,610
Okay, I know.

179
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,310
So, what're you gonna say to her? Why are we here?

180
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,310
What? You haven't thought of anything?

181
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,110
This is your idea, you know.

182
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,910
What makes you think I'd know what to say

183
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,710
when this is the first time I'm seeing her?

184
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,010
Oh, come on. Never mind then, let's head on home.

185
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,010
We don't want her getting suspicious.

186
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,010
Get off it, idiot. We can't turn back after coming this far...

187
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,810
Who is it?

188
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,710
Shoots.

189
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,610
Oh, it's me, Conan.

190
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,910
Conan?

191
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,710
Oh, the cool, kid? What's up, Conan?

192
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,610
I just came to see you.

193
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,010
Okay, wait a minute.

194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,210
All right, all right. I'm not drunk.

195
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,410
I can walk on my own, so let me go, Nakamachi.

196
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,410
Oh, look out, Mr. Kawakami.

197
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,210
I'm sorry,

198
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,910
he gave you both a bad time.

199
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,710
No problem, Mr. Takai is always like that when he's drunk.

200
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,410
I'll bet his true self shows when he gets drunk.

201
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,210
You also turn nasty when you're drunk.

202
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,510
Shut up.

203
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,910
What's taking her so long?

204
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,010
How long do we have to wait?

205
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,610
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

206
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,310
I was taking a bath. Sorry.

207
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,010
Oh, are you cool kid's friend?

208
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,410
Yeah.

209
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,710
Come on in.

210
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,710
But I don't have anything to serve you today.

211
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,610
Shall we go out for dinner?

212
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,710
Oh... yes.

213
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,910
I'll go get ready then.

214
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,210
So, please wait in the living room.

215
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,510
Um, before that, may I use the bathroom?

216
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,510
Oh, me too. I've been holding back for a while.

217
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,610
Okay. The rest room is over there.

218
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,010
Thanks.

219
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,010
Oh. So, you're also friends with Ms. Mouri.

220
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,410
That's right. Nice to meet you.

221
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,010
But I was surprised.

222
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,310
I didn't know that cool kid and Ms. Mouri

223
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,410
had a foreign friend like you.

224
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,510
Foreign friend?

225
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,210
Your skin is quite dark for a Japanese.

226
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,410
And your Japanese is a bit strange.

227
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,210
Idiot! Osaka-Ben is authentically Japanese!

228
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,610
Osaka-Ben? Is it some kind of Bento lunch box?

229
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,510
Hey, teacher.

230
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,710
It's a dialect of Japanese.

231
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,210
You know, there are also dialects in the U.S. too, right?

232
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,910
Like the Southern drawl.

233
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,810
Oh, yes, there are.

234
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,010
Osaka-Ben is authentically Japanese.

235
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,510
Look? It's the woman we just saw.

236
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,310
Oh. She's my next door neighbor, Mr. Takai's girlfriend.

237
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,010
What's she doing, taking photos here?

238
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,810
What's that?

239
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,710
It's a cell phone.

240
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,610
Why would it be in a place like this?

241
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,810
It fell from above.

242
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,910
Instant death.

243
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,910
Yeah.

244
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,210
But this guy...

245
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,210
Where the heck did he fall from?

246
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,210
Perhaps from the 21st floor.

247
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,510
How do you know?

248
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,710
Actually he's my neighbor, Mr. Takai.

249
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,810
What? You kidding.

250
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,110
It can't be true?

251
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,610
It's not Mr. Takai.

252
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,410
So, she's Mr. Takai's girlfriend, right?

253
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,610
Yes.

254
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,010
Well, was Mr. Takai still in his room

255
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,710
when you left with the two men?

256
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,710
What? Oh, yes.

257
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,710
I'm sure he was drunk and asleep in bed.

258
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,510
But why... why did he commit suicide?

259
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,710
Why? How do you know he committed suicide?

260
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,310
Maybe someone else in the room pushed him to the ground.

261
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,610
Of course I know!

262
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,110
There was no one but him back in the room.

263
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,510
And I locked the front door when leaving,

264
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,310
and besides that's the only key there is.

265
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,510
Moreover, you can't hear the doorbell when you're in the bedroom.

266
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,810
There's no other possible explanation but suicide.

267
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,810
No.

268
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,310
It's doesn't necessarily have to be so.

269
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,910
Hey. Look at this.

270
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,210
This is Mr. Takai's cell phone, right?

271
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,210
He talked with someone named Mr. Kawakami just before falling down

272
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,810
And a minute before that, he seemed to have read a mail

273
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,810
from a man named Mr. Nakamachi.

274
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,610
Besides, before Mr. Takai fell,

275
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,210
there was a strange woman taking photos of this condo in the dark.

276
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,410
Oh, that was...

277
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,110
Anyway, can you tell us more about it later,

278
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,310
after we call Mr. Kawakami who mailed him

279
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,310
and Mr. Nakamachi who called him,

280
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,810
and the police as well?

281
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,510
Oh, I see.

282
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,610
You were taking pictures of this condo

283
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,710
where your boyfriend, Mr. Takai lived,

284
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,810
because you wanted to show its exterior to your friends, right?

285
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,310
Yes. This is the first time I came here.

286
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,510
And I was going to go back to his room.

287
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,410
After took some photos, a person suddenly came falling to the ground.

288
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,310
I didn't think it would be Mr. Takai.

289
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,910
But that's strange.

290
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,810
You left Mr. Takai's room around 5pm

291
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,310
but he fell just after 6 o'clock.

292
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,710
So, were you taking pictures for a whole hour?

293
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:56,310
No. I started taking pictures after I drove the two men home,

294
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,810
because they were both quite drunk.

295
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,610
Excuse me, what is your connection with her?

296
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,110
We're working for the same company

297
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,910
We were drinking in the afternoon at Mr. Takai's room

298
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,010
to celebrate his promotion from chief to director.

299
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,810
We were going to drink until much later.

300
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,610
But Mr. Takai got too drunk.

301
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,210
We had to cut the party short,

302
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,110
because that guy started taunting us, saying,

303
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,110
'If you want a promotion, you have to get rid of your emotions'

304
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,110
'and just continue looking up ahead.'

305
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,010
'As long as you can't do so, you can't move up'

306
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,110
'the ladder no matter how much you try.'

307
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,710
Oh, he said, if you want promotion, get rid of your emotions?

308
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,010
Yes. So, after Ms. Shimoda drove me home,

309
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,510
I sent an email to Mr. Takai.

310
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,110
Saying, 'Please don't forget to take care of your subordinates too'.

311
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,010
Because I remembered the incident of Ms. Hiraya too.

312
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,610
Ms. Hiraya?

313
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,610
Sumiyo Hiraya who committed suicide last month.

314
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,910
She was a co-worker of ours.

315
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,910
Suicide?

316
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,910
Yeah.

317
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,010
Ms. Hiraya was two years Nakamachi's senior in junior high school.

318
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,910
And, she and he were also Takai's, as well as my junior in college.

319
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,410
So, Takai took a big-brotherly interest

320
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,010
in Ms. Hiraya and Nakamachi, but...

321
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,310
Did Ms. Hiraya join the company in the same year as you, Ms. Shimoda?

322
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,210
Yes.

323
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,210
I see.

324
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,510
Then why did she kill herself?

325
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,210
She suffered a nervous breakdown caused by overwork

326
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,210
and committed suicide.

327
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,510
Mr. Takai once threatened Ms. Hirai over drinks,

328
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,710
saying: 'If you can't fulfil your quota, you will be fired.'

329
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,110
I think she took the joke seriously.

330
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,210
Takai seemed to have forgotten all about it.

331
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,910
So, after Ms. Shimoda drove me back home by car,

332
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,010
I called and told him,

333
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,710
'It's your fault she's dead!'

334
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,410
'You've earned your promotion at the expense of her life.'

335
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,210
Even Takai seemed to be in shock and at a loss for words.

336
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,610
After that, he suddenly hung up the phone.

337
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,010
I was told to come here, and this is what I see.

338
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,710
Then why did Mr. Takai jump to his death?

339
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,810
Yeah, that's right.

340
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,410
It's almost like I killed him.

341
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,410
But, Inspector.

342
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,110
I didn't tell him, 'Drop dead right now.'

343
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,310
I just told him the truth.

344
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,010
I'm not going to be held criminally responsible for killing him, right?

345
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,410
That's true.

346
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,610
Okay. So, what more do you want to hear?

347
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,210
Can we leave now?

348
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,310
We've already answered the same questions twice.

349
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,310
Twice?

350
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,610
We were asked the same questions before you came here.

351
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,510
By a foreign woman,

352
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,710
a boy speaking Osaka-Ben and a little kid with glasses.

353
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,610
Don't tell me those three are...

354
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,310
Do you know where they're now?

355
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,710
Oh, yes.

356
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,110
They took the key to Mr. Takai's room and went to the 21st floor.

357
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,910
21st floor?

358
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,110
So it was you after all?

359
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,310
I'm really glad you held back from entering the room.

360
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,310
All right, you can go now, leave this to us.

361
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,310
What do you mean, huh?

362
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,210
Of course, we've already checked the room thoroughly.

363
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,910
I've also taken a bunch of pictures of the room.

364
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,810
Oh, I see.

365
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,010
Had the front door been locked?

366
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,410
Yeah. It was locked up tight.

367
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,710
Well, this room was locked up.

368
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,310
So, it must be suicide.

369
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,310
That is what I first thought too.

370
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,210
Until I saw the curtain of the bed room window

371
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,310
from which Mr.Takai jumped.

372
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,710
It's pretty much definite that he jumped from this window.

373
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,810
But, isn't it just that the curtain blew outward because of the wind?

374
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,610
Look closer.

375
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,210
The curtain was pulled down, so the curtain rail is bent,

376
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,410
and 2 or 3 hooks seem to have come off, right?

377
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,310
This is evidence that he involuntarily grabbed the curtain

378
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,910
when he came close to falling.

379
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,710
Would someone trying to kill himself do that?

380
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,810
If so, this is not suicide, but...

381
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,510
Murder.

382
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,210
This is a homicide case.

383
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,320
Next Conan's Hint:

384
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,020
"Electro-magnetic wave"
