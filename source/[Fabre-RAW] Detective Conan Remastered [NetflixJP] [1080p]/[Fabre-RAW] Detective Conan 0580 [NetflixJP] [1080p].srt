"Beika Department Store"

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:05,985
It's a phantom.

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,987
He can't possibly be alive.

4
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:13,524
Because I shot Shuichi Akai to death with my very hands.

5
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:25,324
Gin, right in front of your very eyes too, right?

6
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,024
It wasn't in front of my eyes.

7
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:28,824
I was looking through the monitor.

8
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:33,624
Back then, you could've rigged the entire scene.

9
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:36,015
Am I wrong, Kir?

10
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,024
Rigged the scene?

11
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:42,724
Just what could I have done?

12
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:46,324
After all, you're the one who told me

13
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:49,524
to summon Akai over to Raiha Pass in the first place.

14
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:54,033
No. Now, call him over here right now!

15
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:58,037
Well, I'm finding it hard to stay with the Organization,

16
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,524
I want out, so can you help me make it out.

17
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:05,024
Of course, I'll provide you the information that the FBI wants.

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,047
Could I meet you from now, just the two of us?

19
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,924
Yes. As long as you're alone too,

20
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:13,024
I don't mind.

21
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,024
Will this do?

22
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:19,624
You're the one who told me to shoot him in the head too.

23
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:25,824
His head.

24
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:28,824
Shoot the bullet right through his head!

25
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:33,624
That way you can kill him off completely.

26
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:36,075
And you watched everything from the time he bled

27
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:39,824
from his head to when he fell to the ground

28
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:43,024
through the camera that you set on me.

29
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:47,524
After being rescued from the FBI,

30
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,089
I was constantly under the surveillance of the Organization,

31
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:54,093
I couldn't possibly have made any arrangement with him either.

32
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:56,624
Therefore, I couldn't possibly have done anything.

33
00:01:56,624 --> 00:02:02,101
Plus, if either he or I had a god-like brain

34
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,924
that could help us see through things in the future,

35
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,024
maybe we could've worked something out.

36
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:11,224
Yes, just like Sherlock Holmes.

37
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,924
Why don't you stop being so queerly suspicious

38
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:19,024
and just be happy that you arch rival disappeared?

39
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:20,424
Yes.

40
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:23,224
I'm so overjoyed I can't contain it.

41
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:26,125
Because if he ever happens to be alive,

42
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,924
I could kill him all over again.

43
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,131
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

44
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,524
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

45
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:35,924
The time limit closes in.

46
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:38,824
Figure out what the bomb man is really after.

47
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:42,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,524
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

50
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:29,126
A strange job offer came to the Mouri Detective Agency.

51
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:33,526
A person calls and asks Kogoro to talk to a person who is troubled

52
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:36,255
by red T-shirts that were being sent him every week.

53
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:40,259
We went to the Beika Department Store to meet this person

54
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,826
but the person waiting for us there

55
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:44,526
was a man with a bomb wrapped around his body.

56
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,326
The man says that he was threatened by a masked man

57
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:52,271
who told him to place bombs in each place on the floor.

58
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,926
We ended up being confined on this floor.

59
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,626
The masked man wants to find the person

60
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:02,826
who kept sending the red T-shirts to him every week.

61
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:06,726
He says that the man should be on this floor.

62
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:09,326
We checked the 13 T-shirts that were carried

63
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,291
by the man with the bomb wrapped around him

64
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,293
and found from the receipts

65
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:19,126
of the T-shirts that they were all bought

66
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:22,301
at the fitness section every Sunday at 12:28 pm.

67
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:26,326
What is the identity of the person sending the T-shirts?

68
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,826
What is his purpose?

69
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:32,311
And who is the person looking for the sender of the T-shirts

70
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,226
and turned into a bomb threat man?

71
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:43,826
"Black Time Limit Closes In"

72
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:45,426
Vodka.

73
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:48,126
Park the car on the opposite side of the department store!

74
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:50,726
In a position where the guy called Akai

75
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,326
can be seen in clear view.

76
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:56,026
What's the matter?

77
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,026
Hurry and move the car.

78
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,826
Well... You see...

79
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,726
According to Korn who's on guard at the basement exit,

80
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:07,726
something seems to be going on in the department store.

81
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:11,526
Hey, Korn don't you have more information?

82
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:18,026
No, but, I saw a lot of riot police officers

83
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:21,026
and bomb disassembling officers go inside.

84
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:24,363
Riot police officers and bomb disassembling officers?

85
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:27,026
What's going on?

86
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:29,526
What on earth?

87
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,526
"Beika Department Store"

88
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,826
Please wait!

89
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,391
The person who received red underwear every week,

90
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,726
wants us to find the sender among these people.

91
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:58,926
You do understand that the demand of the bomb man, don't you?

92
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:00,399
Yes.

93
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,401
The receipts that were found together

94
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,403
with the T-shirts are those of this department store.

95
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,826
And the only section that sells wears on this floor

96
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,526
is the fitness goods section!

97
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:11,326
Moreover, the time that the wears are bought

98
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:15,326
are always the same as today, every Sunday at 12:28 pm!

99
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:19,226
And to top it off, you're the only salesclerk

100
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:22,726
that's on duty on Sunday at this time, am I right?

101
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,423
Yes...

102
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,726
Then, why don't you remember that customer?

103
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,426
You'd think he'd leave an impression on you, wouldn't he?

104
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:32,026
Because he comes to buy the same thing

105
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,433
at the same hour and day each time!

106
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:38,226
But, I really don't recall such a person.

107
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,526
Darn, no way.

108
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:47,126
That red underwear has not been sold yet today.

109
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:48,826
Then, at that time,

110
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:53,126
did you have someone take your place, or something?

111
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:55,826
Not for the past 6 months!

112
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:59,626
Then, is this receipt from some years ago?

113
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,926
No, because we've been using

114
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:06,126
this type of receipt this year.

115
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:10,826
All I do is get the items and payment from the customers

116
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:15,126
and give them to Ms. Seta at the cash register.

117
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:19,226
Then, I put the receipt and change in the bag together

118
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:22,026
with the purchased items and give them to the customer.

119
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:28,126
So if such a queer customer were to come by,

120
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:32,126
I'm sure I'd never forget.

121
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:33,626
But...

122
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:37,326
We have the receipts proving they were here.

123
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,726
Excuse me...

124
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,026
The bomb man!

125
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,626
Stay away from me!

126
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:47,726
Stop calling me bomb man, please!

127
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:51,326
I'm not the bomb man but rather,

128
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,526
a sinless ordinary citizen who had a bomb

129
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,515
wrapped around my body.

130
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:58,926
That's why

131
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:03,826
I'm telling you to stay away from me until this case is solved, aren't I?

132
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,626
Oh, yes.

133
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,526
But the boy with the glasses

134
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:13,226
is playing around with the red T-shirt.

135
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,026
Playing around?

136
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,545
What're you doing?

137
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,226
Just like you did a while ago, Ran.

138
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:33,026
I just tried folding it according to the crease.

139
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:38,557
But, when they're lined out, they look kind of eerie, right?

140
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:42,026
Remember? Like in the Holmes novel.

141
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,426
"The Adventure of the Dancing Men"?

142
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:46,326
Right, just like the code in that novel!

143
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,926
Then, this could be a code too?

144
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,826
If you read it from the right in the order they were sent

145
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,573
maybe there's a sentence?

146
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,226
-Really, -It hurts...

147
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:59,126
the minute I take my eyes off of you!

148
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:01,726
Dad.

149
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,226
I told you to stay still, didn't I?

150
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:09,426
But, when Conan fold the shirts according to the crease...

151
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,326
He says it could be a code.

152
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:14,026
A code?

153
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:15,826
It couldn't be.

154
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:19,526
We don't even know when the creases were made either!

155
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,326
What?

156
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,926
The sender of red underwear?

157
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,609
Yes, sir!

158
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:34,326
That seems to be the purpose of the bomb man.

159
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:37,426
And? How many bombs are there?

160
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:39,726
According to the image on the surveillance camera

161
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,326
there's one at each of the two elevators and two stairs.

162
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,226
Adding the upward and downward escalators,

163
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:47,826
we're looking at six places at least.

164
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,826
Six places?

165
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,826
What a hassle.

166
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,126
Strange, right?

167
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:56,026
Although the floor was sealed because of a bomb threat,

168
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:58,626
the information's leaking out too fast.

169
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,626
True.

170
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,126
-Besides... -Can't be!

171
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:04,926
You're on the floor where the bomb is?

172
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,426
Hey... Can you make calls?

173
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:09,626
The bomb man is here, isn't he?

174
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:13,226
The cell phones of the customers haven't been taken away.

175
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:16,226
Maybe the culprit's an amateur?

176
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,526
I sure hope so.

177
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,426
Idiot! You gotta be kidding!

178
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,026
I'm not kidding!

179
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,026
There, take a look for yourself!

180
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:27,126
TV telephone.

181
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:32,026
You see the man with a bomb wrapped around his body, don't you?

182
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,926
No joke?

183
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,026
Shu!

184
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:43,026
Transform!

185
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:45,526
There!

186
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:53,026
Hey, what're you doing?

187
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:56,226
Well...

188
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,926
I tried moving according to the shape of the wear.

189
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,926
But, I'm getting nowhere.

190
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,626
Never mind doing something like that.

191
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:07,326
Will you just hurry and find the sender of the T-shirts!

192
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,026
Right...

193
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,326
But...

194
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,711
Don't you think that Dad's movements

195
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,326
just now resembled something?

196
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,826
What?

197
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:17,026
Right!

198
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:20,719
Maybe Conan would be able to figure out what it is.

199
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,026
Gosh, he's gone again!

200
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,426
I see!

201
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:30,326
When you get the items from the customers,

202
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:34,126
you take it to the cashier beyond?

203
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,626
Yes, it is.

204
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,426
After saying, "One moment, please!"

205
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,726
Thanks for telling me!

206
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:42,741
See you!

207
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
Excuse me!

208
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,726
Wait...

209
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:52,751
Son...

210
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,026
So, this is what the inside of the cash register room!

211
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,757
Excuse me...

212
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,326
I'm going to borrow your computer a bit!

213
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:03,126
For what?

214
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:07,426
Pops told me to check something out!

215
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:13,426
On the accident on the snowy mountain on December 28th, right?

216
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,773
Yes.

217
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,826
Here it is! I'm sure this is it!

218
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:31,426
It's an accident that happened 10 years ago.

219
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:33,426
A veteran mountain climber

220
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:36,226
seems to have gotten caught in an avalanche and died!

221
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:40,799
All right!

222
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:42,226
Is that it?

223
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:43,626
Yes!

224
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,626
I'll go tell Pops that it was just as he thought!

225
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,807
I see.

226
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:54,526
Thank you, Ms. Maruoka!

227
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:02,126
I've figured out what the sender is after.

228
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:06,526
Next, I've got to figure out the motive of the bomb man.

229
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,726
What is purpose for causing such a commotion?

230
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:14,226
All I can do is to wait and see what the bomb man's next step.

231
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:15,526
At any rate, I guess I'm not wrong to think

232
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:18,826
that the bomb man is very confident.

233
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,841
He's confident that the crime he committed in the past

234
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,426
will never be disclosed.

235
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:32,026
Really, where were you?

236
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,826
To the restroom.

237
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:34,853
Gosh.

238
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:38,026
Right, it won't be revealed.

239
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:40,126
My crime is perfect.

240
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,526
There is no proof or eye-witnesses either.

241
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:46,126
You imbecile that's trying to threaten me!

242
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:49,226
I'll make sure you won't be able to do something like this again.

243
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:54,026
And, did anything else come up?

244
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,875
No, not at all.

245
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,877
Thanks to you skittering here and there,

246
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,726
I can't organize anything in my head.

247
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:05,526
Dad, you blaming it on Conan.

248
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:10,226
It's all because you used the money from the client on sushi.

249
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:13,326
Now, you're blaming it on Ran.

250
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:14,893
Shut up!

251
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,926
All I've gotta do is think, right! I'll think!

252
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,901
Please excuse me.

253
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:28,226
Snow mountain, after all.

254
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,744
Why won't you let me in?

255
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,744
I can't tell you.

256
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:28,967
So, he's sealed the floor off with bombs.

257
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,971
Yes. It seems that some idiot is doing it.

258
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,544
It seems he demanding for someone to be found.

259
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,977
Since there is no sign of the guy who looks like Akai

260
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:41,844
coming out of the department store at all.

261
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:45,344
I take it that the guy is on that floor too.

262
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:56,744
We've got a problem, don't we?

263
00:16:56,744 --> 00:17:00,544
Even if the bomb man is caught, or if the bomb goes off,

264
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:03,544
the exit would be crowded with chaos.

265
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:07,005
I wonder if we'll be able to get the guy in the commotion.

266
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:10,144
No, it's even better for us.

267
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:13,744
The murderous intent of the sniper will be erased by the crowd,

268
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:17,015
and make it hard for him to flee even if he wanted to.

269
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:20,244
For Chianti who is waiting right above here

270
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:23,444
and Korn who is waiting at the basement exit,

271
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:25,944
he's an easy prey to hunt down.

272
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,027
Hey, does he know about this?

273
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:31,944
He? Just who are you referring to?

274
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,344
Bourbon.

275
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,744
I heard that he went out to look for the scientist Sherry,

276
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,744
who betrayed the Organization.

277
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:40,344
I wonder...

278
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:44,244
He's secretive just like Vermouth.

279
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:47,344
I have no idea where or what they're doing.

280
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:51,444
Come to think of it, Bourbon didn't like Akai either.

281
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,744
Even more than you do, Gin.

282
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:57,044
Well, as for his whereabouts I had no intention of telling

283
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,444
even if I knew where he is.

284
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,744
What? Why not?

285
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:06,144
He refused to believe that Akai was dead.

286
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:09,744
He can't help but think he's the only one

287
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:12,144
who could finish Akai.

288
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:19,077
If the guy in question is Akai, he would snicker.

289
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:23,544
I'd rather not see his face again.

290
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,144
Hey, enough already!

291
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,344
Right!

292
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:39,097
How long is it going to take, anyway?

293
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,101
You're the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

294
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,103
Hurry up and find sender of the red T-shirts

295
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,344
that the bomb man is looking for

296
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:51,109
and let us go home!

297
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,111
Oh, well...

298
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,944
I still have no idea who the sender of the T-shirts is,

299
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:59,117
or anything about who the bomb man is either.

300
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:04,544
Mail?

301
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,125
I've never seen this address before.

302
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:11,544
What? Can't be...

303
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:18,644
No...

304
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:24,644
Wait, dad!

305
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:26,744
That's right near the bomb.

306
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,544
I'll be fine.

307
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,144
I won't let the bomb go off.

308
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:37,744
In the name of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

309
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,144
Then, don't tell me you've figured out

310
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,161
who the sender of the red T-shirts is?

311
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,744
But, you just said a while ago that you had no idea.

312
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:51,944
Yes, the invisible sender and invisible bomb man.

313
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:55,744
That's where the key to solving this case was!

314
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:03,744
What? There was movement on the confined floor?

315
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,244
Yes, it just so happened

316
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:08,844
that Detective Kogoro Mouri was on the floor.

317
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:12,344
What? The Sleeping Kogoro?

318
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,544
I hope he somehow stops the bomb from exploding.

319
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:19,644
I know it's a hassle but we're counting on you, Detective Mouri!

320
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:22,044
Don't you think it's strange?

321
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:27,544
If you look at the receipts that were sent along with the red underwear,

322
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:29,944
it's easy to tell that they were purchased

323
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:34,544
every Sunday at 12:28 pm.

324
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:37,215
If you want to figure out who the sender is,

325
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,217
just come to that floor where the item is sold

326
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:44,844
at the time indicated secretly and the sender will eventually appear.

327
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,944
I'm sure that the sender didn't show up.

328
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:50,644
That's why the culprit knocked that man out in the men's room

329
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:54,444
and wrapped the bomb, and told him to look for the sender.

330
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,244
That's what's weird.

331
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:57,744
What?

332
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:00,744
In order to wrap a bomb around someone's body,

333
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:03,241
you've got to be somewhere that nobody will see you.

334
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:08,044
By doing so, you'll have to take your eyes off the fitness section.

335
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:12,044
Would I, who is desperately looking for the sender

336
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:16,144
even to the point of using bombs, do something like that?

337
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:20,044
True, but, if the bomb man had an accomplice

338
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,044
and that person was watching.

339
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:25,544
There's none! Take a good look around!

340
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:33,271
Everybody's using the cell phone all over the place, see?

341
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,275
If someone wanted to take control of the floor had an accomplice,

342
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,444
he would never let them do something like that.

343
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:41,644
Then...

344
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:44,344
Maybe he wrapped the bomb around

345
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,944
that man's body before 12:28 pm and got ready?

346
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:51,544
No, the bomb was actually more like a last resort thing.

347
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,844
As for the bombs on the floor,

348
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:57,295
it'll be okay if they're retrieved before exploding

349
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,444
but it's too risky to wrap a bomb around someone's body beforehand

350
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:04,944
under the circumstance that the sender may show up.

351
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:10,544
But, the bomb man is alone, isn't he?

352
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:13,644
How could he ever wrap the bomb around the man's body

353
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,444
while keeping an eye on the place where the item is sold?

354
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:18,944
He didn't wrap it here but rather,

355
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:21,944
came here with it wrapped around his body.

356
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:25,644
With it wrapped around... It can't be...

357
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,844
Don't tell me that...

358
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:30,244
Isn't that right?

359
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,744
Bomb man?

360
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,044
Mr. Ordinary Citizen?

361
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

362
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,726
"Lipstick"

363
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:07,425
I'm putting on lipstick today.

364
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,428
Don't tell me you're planning to kiss that detective kid?

365
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:10,680
No, I'm not!
