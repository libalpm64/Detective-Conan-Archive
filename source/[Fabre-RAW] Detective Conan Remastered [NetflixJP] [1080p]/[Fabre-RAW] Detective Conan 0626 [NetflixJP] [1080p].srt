1
00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:04,381
Pops Kogoro was invited over to the

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:07,581
university festival of his alma mater, Beika University.

3
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:10,181
Ran, Sonoko and I who accompanied him there

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:14,781
were called over by Mr. Sonsaku Tsujiei, a movie art major,

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,881
and taken to the haunted "Screaming Hospital"

6
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,581
that he was managing.

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:23,881
He asks Ran and the others who have encountered numerous cases

8
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,781
to check out how good the zombies look.

9
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,681
Anna Tadami in particular,

10
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,281
seemed to be very confident in the zombie

11
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,481
she was performing.

12
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:38,881
However, Anna ended up showing us,

13
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,081
how it actually looked to be dead.

14
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:45,581
She suddenly had a convulsion before our eyes and died.

15
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,681
She died of potassium cyanide poisoning,

16
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,881
and it was thought at first that she drank it herself

17
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,481
and committed suicide,

18
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,181
but, I'm not being deceived!

19
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,981
This is homicide made to look like suicide!

20
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,581
Moreover, it turns out that this case

21
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,481
has something to do with the death of their friend,

22
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:05,281
Mr. Hashiguchi who killed himself and died a month ago.

23
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,581
Who on earth was it that poisoned Anna in the dark?

24
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,081
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

25
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,281
You must be true to yourself.

26
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,281
There's a ghostly phenomenon at the school festival?

27
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,281
Solve the mystery of the moving corpse.

28
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,881
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,981
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,681
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:14,151
"Screaming Operation Room (Part 2)"

32
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:18,251
It's from that time on, wasn't it? That Anna changed.

33
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,451
Yeah. She suddenly started saying that it was a tribute to Hashiguchi

34
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,951
and began making the graduation project movie,

35
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:25,451
and started getting carried away with this haunted room too.

36
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,951
But, isn't it natural to want to try hard

37
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,051
for a friend who has crossed over?

38
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:33,051
But, she was way out of line!

39
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:35,751
There was a time when she overdosed on sleeping pills

40
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,751
and was taken to the hospital too.

41
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,351
Her reason for doing so, was that she wanted to experience

42
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,051
how it felt to be in between life and death

43
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,151
and use it as reference as to how to look really dead.

44
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,351
-Right? -Yeah.

45
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,451
One day I thought she was being quite reticent

46
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,651
and found out that she had nails in her mouth the whole day.

47
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:53,451
Nails?

48
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,851
Maybe Anna

49
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:59,251
had the capsule with the poison inside it in her mouth.

50
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:01,651
Right! It's the same as the nails!

51
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:04,451
Then, she may have accidentally bitten it and...

52
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,751
Therefore, before getting to experience how it felt to be

53
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,151
in between life and death,

54
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:10,651
she ended up really dying.

55
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,551
So, did she actually commit suicide after all then?

56
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:17,551
I wonder if it's really so?

57
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,751
Conan?

58
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:26,151
Because look at the cheek of this woman!

59
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:29,851
There's what looks to be a real scratch, not make-up.

60
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,651
It even looks as if the blood had smeared!

61
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:36,651
Maybe somebody tried to cover her mouth by force

62
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,051
so she in an attempt to pull free mistakenly scratched herself

63
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:40,551
with her own nails?

64
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:43,451
What?

65
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,651
Inspector! There are traces of skin and blood between her nails.

66
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,451
What?

67
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,751
In other words, someone tried to shove the poisoned capsule

68
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,351
into her mouth

69
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,651
and covered her mouth and nose

70
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,951
until she swallowed it?

71
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:01,051
But, if so, she would've already been dead

72
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,551
by the time Ran and the others got here.

73
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,051
She was really kicking her legs up and down

74
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,551
and struggling, right?

75
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,351
Yes.

76
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,351
I see, so that's what happened!

77
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:13,551
Sonoko?

78
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:17,051
The culprit came before we did, made Anna drink the poison

79
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,651
and killed her, then hid under the bed!

80
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:24,051
He shook the bed himself, kicked his legs up and down,

81
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,051
then flipped the sheet that was on her over

82
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,151
to show Anna's leg.

83
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,051
Then he slipped out of bed,

84
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:34,251
and made it look as if Anna was still alive!

85
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,451
In other words, the only one who could've done it

86
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,051
would've been you, Mutusmi, right?

87
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:42,351
What? Me?

88
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,851
Being as small as you are,

89
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:47,951
you could slip out of the bed without anyone noticing.

90
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,451
Besides, you're the only one here who's...

91
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,751
wearing sandals!

92
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,251
You would be able to wear sandals right away

93
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,251
even if you came out of the bed, right?

94
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,651
You know what?

95
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,651
Her legs weren't visible anyway,

96
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,151
so she wouldn't have had to take off her shoes, right?

97
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,951
Then, the next person that's small is you, so you're the culprit!

98
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:06,951
You seem to be much faster than Mutsumi, besides.

99
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,851
Idiot! I've got a sprained ankle, you know!

100
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,951
I can somehow manage to walk normally

101
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,751
but I wouldn't be able to kick my legs up and down

102
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,151
because it would be too painful.

103
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,951
See, look! I've got compress on it

104
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:22,151
and it's held in place with a bandage, isn't it?

105
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:26,151
Then, it's you who's been fidgeting for a while now!

106
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,451
You're probably not comfortable

107
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:29,251
because of feelings of guilt, right?

108
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,551
I'm fidgeting with my foot because my athlete's foot itches.

109
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:36,551
Hey, your shoe is bright red?

110
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,751
Well, I was trying to relieve the itch

111
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:41,551
by holding my foot down with the other foot but...

112
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,051
That's blood paint.

113
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:45,451
You must've stepped on it somewhere.

114
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:48,851
Then, maybe it's when you shook the bed a while ago?

115
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,251
Because the blood paint burst out

116
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:54,651
would accumulate under the upper right leg of the bed.

117
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:58,351
At any rate, anyone of you three,

118
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,051
after poisoning her, sneak under the bed,

119
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:03,651
and make it look as if she were alive

120
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,151
then appear again as if nothing had happened.

121
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,751
Oh my.

122
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,951
We couldn't have.

123
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,751
As you can see,

124
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,051
mannequins of a doctor standing are on both sides of the bed.

125
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,351
So, even if you try to sneak out from the side of the bed,

126
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:21,351
you would bump into the mannequins

127
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,051
and give yourself away on the spot.

128
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,751
If you tried to get away from the place

129
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:26,051
where there are no obstacles,

130
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,051
you would be in full view of these girls

131
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,651
that were standing at the head of the bed.

132
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:29,951
Besides!

133
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,951
This bed is handmade so...

134
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,351
two adults could never get on it.

135
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,451
Handmade?

136
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,151
Yeah, because Anna said that it would creak

137
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:42,851
when she struggled and give more impact that way.

138
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,051
Since it's so uncomfortable,

139
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:48,951
others who had to play the role didn't care for it, though.

140
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,551
Maybe Anna scratched herself on her cheek too.

141
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:57,751
Because with real blood coming out, it would have more impact.

142
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,651
Anna would think of something like that.

143
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:01,051
Yeah.

144
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:04,851
I wonder if she committed suicide after all, then?

145
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,251
No. The position of the scratch is one that was made

146
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:10,051
when she fought back at the culprit.

147
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:11,651
But, I don't understand.

148
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:15,751
How on earth did the culprit make it look like she was alive?

149
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:25,151
On the back side of the upper cover by the legs is a red streak.

150
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,851
It's water based paint.

151
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,651
Is it blood paint?

152
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:33,651
Wait a sec. If I remember correctly, under the bed...

153
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,251
A cardboard box and this masking tape

154
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,154
on the cut piece of the sheet.

155
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,351
No doubt about it!

156
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:47,251
The culprit made use of this space!

157
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:53,651
In order to make Anna's death look as real as possible.

158
00:08:55,951 --> 00:09:00,551
Anna!

159
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:05,651
And? How about it, coroner?

160
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:08,251
The death spot is pink.

161
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,651
This is unmistakably death from potassium cyanide poisoning.

162
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:14,351
I see.

163
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:18,551
Just in case, I also checked the mask and the tubes

164
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:22,751
that were connected to it when the victim died but...

165
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,351
the cause of her death isn't that.

166
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,851
You mean it's the capsule that was in her mouth?

167
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,151
Yeah.

168
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,951
A high concentrate of cyanide response was detected.

169
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:35,651
The scratch on her cheek bothers me a bit but...

170
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:40,651
If there are people who witnessed the deceased suddenly suffering,

171
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,951
there's no other explanation than that she herself,

172
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:46,651
bit the capsule with the poison inside it.

173
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,151
After all she was wearing a mask,

174
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:53,251
so nobody could've put the capsule in her mouth.

175
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,551
Gosh. If the story about her

176
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:56,851
wanting to experience a near death experience

177
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:00,751
and put something like that in her mouth is true,

178
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,851
all decency has been lost.

179
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,551
Can we go home already?

180
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,051
After all, it's been concluded that she committed suicide...

181
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:12,051
rather, that she died of an accident.

182
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:15,251
Yeah. After you go with Officer Takagi to the station

183
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,551
and finish interrogation, you may leave.

184
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,451
Where's Officer Takagi?

185
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,151
If you're talking about the other officer,

186
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,951
a boy wearing glasses called and stopped him.

187
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,751
Why?

188
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,351
-I have no idea. -Sorry, but...

189
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:31,251
Sonoko suddenly says that she's going to start a deduction show

190
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:34,451
so to gather in the operation room, the scene of the crime.

191
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:40,951
Okay.

192
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,951
I've already fired the needle of the tranquilizer gun.

193
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:46,051
The mini mike is also attached to the back of her collar.

194
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,151
All I have to do now is use the voice changer

195
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,751
to mimic Sonoko's voice.

196
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:55,651
Just what is the meaning of this?

197
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,351
Sonoko!

198
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,251
The cause of Anna's

199
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:03,451
could be none other than accidental death

200
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,151
because she mistakenly bit the poisoned capsule.

201
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:09,851
Therefore, just what and how do you propose to make a deduction?

202
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:14,051
No. As you can tell from the scratch mark on Anna's cheek,

203
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:18,951
someone shoved the poisoned capsule into her mouth

204
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,151
and killed her.

205
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:24,851
In other words, before Ran and I came into this operation room,

206
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,151
Anna was already poisoned to death.

207
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:31,851
Mutsumi was in the X-Ray room next door.

208
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,751
Mr. Tsujiei and Mr. Hachiya

209
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:37,851
who came into this operation room after us.

210
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:40,551
One of the three is the one who did it!

211
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,882
Hey, you guys saw

212
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:53,482
Anna suffer and struggle about, didn't you?

213
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:57,982
Yes, she was having a convulsion.

214
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,482
She was kicking her legs up and down.

215
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:09,482
If so...

216
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,482
It looked like she was having a convulsion

217
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,182
because the bed was shaking and rattling.

218
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:17,982
Then what about her kicking her legs up and down?

219
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:21,482
The sheet flipped over and her feet were showing, right?

220
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:22,782
Yes.

221
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:24,682
Can't you figure it out?

222
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:27,282
The bed is handmade, the framework is latticed

223
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,382
and is loosely made, you know?

224
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,882
If you're under the bed, don't you think something can be done?

225
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,182
Under the bed?

226
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:38,882
I see! The culprit grabbed dead Anna's legs

227
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:40,082
from under the bed sheets and all,

228
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:41,382
made it look like she was kicking her legs up and down

229
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:45,082
so she looked like she was suffering, no?

230
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:47,282
Like this?

231
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:54,482
Hey! Is someone under the bed?

232
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,382
It's me!

233
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,982
Conan?

234
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:01,182
Just like Sonoko told me to,

235
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:05,082
I stuck both my arms up from under the bed.

236
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,382
How was it?

237
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:09,682
Well... her legs were kicking up and down faster

238
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,782
when we were watching.

239
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,282
And, the way it was done now,

240
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:15,282
the sheet underneath would also flip over

241
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:17,682
so I think it was a bit different.

242
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:21,982
Besides, if the sheet on top of her flipped over more than it should

243
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:24,882
and the culprit's hand that grabbed her legs is in view,

244
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:26,882
everything would be more than conspicuous.

245
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:30,982
Then, how about this?

246
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:39,982
Officer Takagi?

247
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,982
Officer Takagi is sticking his hands from out

248
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:43,782
under the bed like Conan did.

249
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:47,182
But the kicking is faster than before

250
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:50,182
and the sheet underneath isn't flipped over either.

251
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:52,682
No way.

252
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,582
There's no one on the bed and yet how come only the legs are...

253
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:57,682
It can't be, it's impossible.

254
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,882
Legs from out under the bed!

255
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,182
The legs are showing from the cut part of the sheet?

256
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,982
What on earth is going on anyway?

257
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,882
Ta... Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,182
Oh, yes, sir.

259
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,782
The trick's easy.

260
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:15,782
First you roll up the sheet up to your knee,

261
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:19,482
then fold the sheet until it comes to the knee.

262
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,882
Pick up the cut piece of sheet that's under the bed

263
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:24,782
and cover the wooden framework of the bed,

264
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,482
then fix it in place with masking tape.

265
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,882
Pull the switch that ejects blood

266
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:32,482
through the joint part of the sheet

267
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,382
and all is set!

268
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:36,982
All that's left to do next, is to stick both your legs out

269
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:38,682
from the joint part of the sheet.

270
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:40,682
Then do as Officer Takagi did a while ago,

271
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,082
kicking his legs up and down

272
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,882
and flip the sheet over to show his legs.

273
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:47,682
It would look like Anna is still alive

274
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,982
and struggling in pain!

275
00:14:49,982 --> 00:14:53,882
If the switch is pushed immediately and blood gushes out.

276
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:56,682
While we were surprised watching this happen,

277
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:58,182
the culprit quietly took his legs out

278
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:00,682
of the joint part of the sheet,

279
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,082
wore his shoes,

280
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:05,782
pulled the sheet that he added on under the bed,

281
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,282
removed the masking tape.

282
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,682
Then left from the foot of the bed,

283
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:11,682
which was a blind spot from where we were.

284
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,082
In other words, the culprit

285
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:17,082
came to this operation room before we came,

286
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,082
forced Anna to drink the poison and killed her.

287
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,982
He then rigged the sheet,

288
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,582
and when we went over to the head of the bed where Anna was,

289
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,982
he shook the bed with both hands.

290
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,782
This way, after making it look as if Anna were alive,

291
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:31,282
he snuck out from the bed,

292
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:35,482
and appeared before us as if nothing had happened!

293
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:38,182
So, the one capable of doing this

294
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:41,282
is the one who appeared before us immediately after that.

295
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:45,082
Hey.

296
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:49,882
It's nothing to get that scared about is there, you two.

297
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:54,982
He's right.

298
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:59,382
All of this is just fake stuff.

299
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:02,082
What? Is something wrong?

300
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:08,682
I see. So, anyone of you three could've committed the crime.

301
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:10,982
Hey, I didn't do it!

302
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:12,282
Besides, if it were that way,

303
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:14,082
when her legs are kicked up and down,

304
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:16,582
the covers on top her would flip over too much

305
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,282
and Anna's legs would show, right?

306
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,882
Right!

307
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:24,082
If Anna's legs come into view, the trick will be seen through!

308
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,282
To avoid this from happening, the culprit...

309
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:32,182
has bent Anna's legs toward the outside.

310
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:33,582
Don't be ridiculous!

311
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,482
That kind of deception will be see right through

312
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,082
as soon as the sheet is flipped up.

313
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:40,082
That's why the culprit prepared things beforehand.

314
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,582
Right?

315
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:44,382
Saying that you were taking Anna to the hospital,

316
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:47,982
you put your hand into the bed and carried her up.

317
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,582
I'll take Anna to the hospital.

318
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:53,182
Mr. Sonsaku Tsujiei?

319
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,682
I see! If he carries her up,

320
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,282
even if her legs were folded in bed, you wouldn't be able to tell.

321
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:01,582
No!

322
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:04,082
I really thought that Anna fell sick or something and...

323
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:07,120
By the way,

324
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,282
is your athlete's foot okay already?

325
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:13,120
In order to throw the poisoned capsule into Anna's mouth

326
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,982
while she was lying on the bed

327
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:18,482
and cover her mouth and nose until she swallows it.

328
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:18,926
Since the culprit wasn't able to hold her

329
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,926
while the bed was shaking,

330
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:23,282
he stuck his shoe in the space

331
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:24,926
under the upper right leg of the bed

332
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:28,598
so that it wouldn't shake, no?

333
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:31,482
Only, he forgot that there was a pool of blood paint there.

334
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:34,982
Because of this, a red square mark of the leg of the bed

335
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:37,082
remained on his shoe.

336
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:38,782
Unfortunately, you realized this,

337
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,682
only after the police arrived.

338
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:43,282
That's why you pretended to have athlete's foot

339
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:47,682
and rubbed the shoe with the blood paint on it onto the other shoe

340
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,682
and tried to get the square trace

341
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,082
that was on the shoe to smear off!

342
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,282
But, this trick wouldn't have worked

343
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,982
unless we served as guides for you

344
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:59,282
in this haunted operation room, would it?

345
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:02,382
Right. We brought you here coincidentally

346
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,682
only because Mr. Mouri couldn't come here.

347
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:06,682
It wasn't a coincidence!

348
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:08,782
Your target was Ran his daughter, to begin with,

349
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:12,482
who you thought would most probably accompany him here.

350
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:15,582
First, the wisdom bag!

351
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:20,282
At this rate, who knows when he'll finish talking.

352
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:22,782
I mean after hearing that a detective was coming,

353
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:25,482
I wanted him to take a look and then.

354
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:29,082
Oh, I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

355
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,982
Did you want to see my father about something?

356
00:18:30,982 --> 00:18:33,082
Could it be that you want him to investigate a case?

357
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:35,882
No, that's not it but...

358
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,682
If you're his daughter, do you go to investigate cases at times?

359
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:42,382
Yes, at times.

360
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:46,082
Then... you've seen it, haven't you?

361
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,282
You deliberately talked about

362
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:51,282
Detective Mouri right beside Ran and brought us here

363
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:53,982
and set us up as eye-witnesses

364
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,582
because you figured girls would be terrified. Isn't that right?

365
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,982
Serving as an escort would probably come up too,

366
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:00,382
and you could also fake losing sight of us,

367
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:03,582
making it easy for you to prepare to scare us inside the room.

368
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:07,282
By hiding a surprise device under the bed,

369
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:11,182
you could put it on right away, and appear too.

370
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:14,082
Nonsense! What proof do you have of this?

371
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:18,582
Then, why not show us your athlete's foot?

372
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:19,782
Well...

373
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:22,182
On the back side of the covers,

374
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:25,182
there were several streaks of red lines.

375
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:27,282
That's the trace of your nail

376
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:30,682
when you slipped your foot inside the bed.

377
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:33,682
You realized for the first time only after you murdered Anna

378
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,582
and bent her legs toward the outside, right?

379
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:40,382
That she was wearing red pedicure.

380
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:44,482
So, you should still have traces of it on your foot.

381
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:48,982
The red blood paint that you put on your nails to get yourself

382
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:51,082
out of the predicament!

383
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,282
Excuse me.

384
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,282
I see.

385
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:03,382
He slipped his legs into the bed before the pedicure dried

386
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:08,382
so the blood paint on his nails smeared onto the upper cover.

387
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:12,482
Well, Mutsumi is wearing sandals.

388
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:16,082
Mr. Hachiya showed us his toes

389
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,982
so the only suspect left is you.

390
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:24,382
-Hey, no joke? -Why would you want to kill Anna?

391
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,282
You're aware that Anna I

392
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:30,682
used to argue a lot about how to perform being dead, right?

393
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:34,082
She made so much fuss that I asked her.

394
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:39,182
Have you ever seen a person die?

395
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:41,582
Then, she said.

396
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:43,382
I have!

397
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:45,282
I've seen it over and over for a hundred times,

398
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:47,082
that's why I even see it in my dreams!

399
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:49,882
Just what do you mean by that?

400
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:54,182
I asked Mr. Hashiguchi

401
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:57,482
to shoot everything on video for me

402
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:01,882
if he was planning to kill himself anyway!

403
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:03,482
No...

404
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,682
No joke?

405
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,382
When we found the body of Hashiguchi in his room,

406
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:11,282
Anna was acting strange, wasn't she?

407
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,082
She was really excited saying things like,

408
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,982
"Call the police,"

409
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,182
Or, "Search the room because his last will must be somewhere".

410
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:20,482
Then, don't tell me that she...

411
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:21,882
Yeah.

412
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:25,082
She said she took the tape out of the video camera

413
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:28,482
that was hidden inside the bookshelf at that time.

414
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:31,382
That's why, I made her go through

415
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:33,582
the same thing that Hashiguchi did!

416
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,982
I told her that the black paint she had on her teeth

417
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,782
was wearing off so that I'd fix it for her.

418
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:41,282
I cracked the capsule with my mouth

419
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:46,182
and threw the capsule into her mouth!

420
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,182
Rather than try to stop him from committing suicide,

421
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:53,082
she had the nerve to urge him on.

422
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,482
Even if he only had six more months to live

423
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,282
because of his illness,

424
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,382
with six more months to go,

425
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:01,882
we could've maybe completed our graduation project movie.

426
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:05,682
And we may have been able to show it to him...

427
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:10,382
And yet... and yet she had the nerve to...

428
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:44,782
Well... but Pops never came, after all.

429
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:48,582
Okay, bag 104 is what everybody has.

430
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:50,282
A bag stored with patience!

431
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:51,682
If this bag of stored patience bursts,

432
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,582
I can't continue on with the detective business.

433
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:57,882
-I don't believe it. -He's still lecturing.

434
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,182
Talk about too long...

435
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,300
Rain

437
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,000
