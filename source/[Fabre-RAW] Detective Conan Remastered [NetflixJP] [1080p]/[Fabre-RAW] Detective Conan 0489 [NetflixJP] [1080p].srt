1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,490
It says here that on the day the incident occurred,

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,290
after work, you stopped over

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,960
at a pub on Suehiro Avenue called Espa,

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,660
and drank beer along with 180 cc of sake,

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,660
then left the pub at around 20:00.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,370
Is this correct?

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,470
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,470
At the Toriyacho intersection,

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,170
a little after 23:00, you hit the victim,

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,170
who was on his way home with your car.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,780
Where and what were you doing during this time?

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,580
I figured I should cool off a bit before going home,

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,980
so I took a rest in the car, and fell asleep.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,890
Is there anyone who can testify this for you?

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,190
No.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,890
Why did you flee from the scene of the accident

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,360
instead of helping the victim right away?

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,260
I got so upset...

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,060
that I...

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,170
Is that really the only reason?

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,870
Ten days have already gone by

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,770
since you've been detained,

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,780
but is the prosecutor asking you every day?

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,680
Ms. Kujo, the prosecutor in charge is an able woman.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,390
She would never detain anyone for 10 days without reason.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm on your side.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,660
So, even if it is something disadvantageous to you,

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,460
please be honest with me.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,680
Ms. Kisaki.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,380
Have you come to talk to the suspect?

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,180
Yes, sort of...

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,280
Great timing, Ms. Kujo.

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,080
I'd like to talk to you.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,890
What is it?

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,890
It's been a while since Mr. Takeuchi's detained,

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,160
so I'd like to ask you to release him. Isn't it about time?

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,960
He turned himself in,

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,760
and since he's already admitted to committing the crime,

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,870
is there any further reason you should keep him detained?

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,770
I hate to put it this way,

41
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,370
but I'd like that judgment to be left up to me.

42
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,180
Then, I'll submit a request for you

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,780
to make public the reason for his detention.

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,080
Please go ahead and do what you must.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
If you will excuse me, goodbye.

46
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,390
What are you after, Prosecutor Kujo?

47
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,160
Only to bring the truth to light.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,060
It's so unlike you, Ms. Kujo.

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,760
I'll see you in court.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,880
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,080
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,780
Two sizzling hot rivals.

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,680
Attorney At Law, Kisaki,

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,980
confronts a competent prosecutor in court.

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,090
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,990
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,040
"Confrontation in Court III".

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,150
"Prosecutor is Witness".

60
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,850
Really, why do I have to do something like this?

61
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,460
But this job is what you asked mom to do, isn't it?

62
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,760
I only asked her because the woman owner of a shop that I frequent

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,060
asked me if I knew a good lawyer.

64
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,760
I hear that prosecutor Kujo was hiding

65
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,970
the fact that she was in charge of the case.

66
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,970
It's a simple case, in which all that's left to do now

67
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,670
is to lighten the sentence as much as possible

68
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,440
after pleading extenuating circumstances.

69
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,940
It doesn't matter who the prosecutor is!

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,640
Just as Pops says

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,950
there should be no room for a confrontation in court.

72
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,850
I wonder what Prosecutor Kujo is after.

73
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,050
"Toriya Police Station"

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,060
Thank you for coming from so far away.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,660
This is the car that had the accident.

76
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,460
If I remember correctly, the victim was on a bicycle.

77
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,870
Yes, sir. According to an eye-witness,

78
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,970
the car ran the red light

79
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,970
and hit the bicycle upon entering the intersection.

80
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,470
From the traces left behind,

81
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,070
it is thought that the driver was going

82
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,140
at a speed of almost 60 kilometers.

83
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
How terrible.

84
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,450
Hey, Kid.

85
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,350
Don't go touching the evidence.

86
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,550
Pops.

87
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,750
How tall was the man called Takeuchi?

88
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,650
How tall?

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,460
I think he was a bit taller than me.

90
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,460
Then, I wonder if someone else drove the car after the accident?

91
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,860
Don't be silly.

92
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,760
There's no way that anyone could've driven the car

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,670
after such an accident.

94
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,870
But look at this seat.

95
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,340
See, the seat is pushed a lot to the front, right?

96
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,140
I think it would even be hard for you to drive this way, Pops.

97
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,450
True. Maybe it's just about right for me.

98
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,750
When you confiscated this car,

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,150
did a women officer drive it?

100
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,450
No way!

101
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,560
We would never drive a vehicle that serves as evidence.

102
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,460
We brought this car here from the condo of the suspect

103
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
using a tow truck.

104
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,660
Then, maybe the forensic officers moved the seat forward

105
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,670
when they inspected it.

106
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,370
No, the forensic officer didn't move the seat either.

107
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,870
I'm sure because Prosecutor Kujo was very careful

108
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,640
about confirming that point too.

109
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,940
Madonna was?

110
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,540
Yes, that's right.

111
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,850
I mean she was so very persistent.

112
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,560
Just as the bicycle was about to cross the intersection

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,760
the car rammed into the bicycle.

114
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,360
And, where were you at that time?

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,760
I was stopped at the traffic signal at this corner here

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
waiting for the light to change.

117
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,940
Oh, no.

118
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,150
Since the driver screeched to a stop,

119
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,350
I thought he was going to come out of the car to help the victim,

120
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,550
but he just hit and ran.

121
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,550
And, did you see the driver's face?

122
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,550
No, because it was dark,

123
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,760
and he didn't come out of the car.

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,160
I see.

125
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,260
Sir?

126
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Wasn't the driver

127
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,560
a very small person?

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,770
Sonny, how did you know...

129
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,770
Well?

130
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,970
Yes, the prosecutor asked me the same question too.

131
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,570
However, since the driver didn't come out of the car,

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,740
I couldn't tell how tall the driver was, or if it was a man or a woman.

133
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,840
Hey, wait up!

134
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,650
What do you mean it was a woman?

135
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,750
The one who turned himself in is a man!

136
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,850
I know because I read the papers.

137
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,150
I thought that was a queer question to ask me.

138
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,350
And, what did you answer, Sir?

139
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,560
So, like I said, I didn't see the driver,

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,960
so I couldn't answer.

141
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,460
I guess not.

142
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,360
And, was there anything else you noticed?

143
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,170
Well, something I noticed...

144
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,340
That's right, when the culprit fled

145
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,640
something glistened around here.

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,250
Not glasses?

147
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,850
No, it had more glitter.

148
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,750
Accessory?

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,260
-We're home! -We're home!

150
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,260
You're back, Ran and Conan.

151
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,660
Either way, we'll just have to

152
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,070
wait and see what the prosecutor has to say.

153
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,870
I'll pay you a good sum,

154
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,470
so please just see to it that everything turns out okay.

155
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Your husband seems to be exhausted too,

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,750
so please go see him as much as you can.

157
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,550
I'm busy with work, you see.

158
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,850
Goodbye.

159
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
You say that the driver of the car that got into the accident

160
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,960
may have been a woman?

161
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
It seems that Prosecutor Kujo was

162
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,870
asking the taxi driver whether the driver of the car was a woman.

163
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,070
Is she saying that my client is lying?

164
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,970
Maybe he's a scapegoat.

165
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,340
A hit-and run is a serious crime.

166
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,840
It's not possible that someone would act as a scapegoat.

167
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,550
Don't tell me he's doing it for his wife?

168
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,650
The seat of the car would be a perfect fit for his wife's height.

169
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,450
Maybe Prosecutor Kujo is not releasing him

170
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,560
because that's what she's after?

171
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,860
Ms. Kuriyama.

172
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,760
Mrs. Takeuchi said that she was busy with work,

173
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,470
but what does she do?

174
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,870
Something about she succeeded her father who passed away last year,

175
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,670
and is now the president of her father's company.

176
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,840
His wife is of a higher rank than he is.

177
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
Yes, but I don't think

178
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
he'll act as a scapegoat in a hit-and-run case

179
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,650
unless he has a good reason.

180
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,750
Ms. Kuriyama.

181
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,950
Yes.

182
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,350
Will you call the investigation company

183
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,350
and gather the staff immediately?

184
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,950
We need to redo the investigation.

185
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,260
Okay!

186
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,060
This case doesn't seem to be a mere hit-and-run incident.

187
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,050
Ms. Kujo?

188
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,520
May I have a moment with you?

189
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
Please wait ten minutes

190
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,430
because I have two more kilometers to go.

191
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,730
Okay, I'll be at the lounge downstairs.

192
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,530
All right.

193
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,540
I'm sorry to intrude on you during your lunch break.

194
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,240
No problem.

195
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,640
So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?

196
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,240
Well, you see.

197
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,650
Let me get straight to the point, then.

198
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,450
Please release Mr. Takeuchi right now!

199
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,520
You're not after Mr. Takeuchi,

200
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,020
but rather his wife, aren't you?

201
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,420
Just what are you doing?

202
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,430
Doing something similar to arresting someone on a holding charge.

203
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,130
Or do you have something else in mind?

204
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,840
Okay.

205
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,740
I'll approve his release.

206
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,940
Huh?

207
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,740
Bye, then, I have a case to attend to.

208
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,940
Hey, Ms. Kujo!

209
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,240
Ms. Kujo?

210
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,620
-Huh? -He was released?

211
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes, just a while ago.

212
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
He's talking to Ms. Kisaki now.

213
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,830
At least now you've been released.

214
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,430
But the tough part has just begun.

215
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,440
If you really need my help,

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,940
please tell me the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

217
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,740
I've told you the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

218
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,040
Ms. Kisaki.

219
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,850
Well,

220
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,850
I guess I'll go get myself a good drink, since it's been a while.

221
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,820
-Mr. Takeuchi. -Huh?

222
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,420
Didn't you turn yourself in as a scapegoat for your wife?

223
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,030
Why'd you do such a stupid thing?

224
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,430
No, I did it.

225
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,730
Don't lie to me!

226
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,030
Do you have proof or something?

227
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,440
The prosecution is investigating on that line too.

228
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,140
If they have evidence, she should've been arrested long ago.

229
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,540
Do you think something like that would work for Prosecutor Kujo?

230
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,650
If it's about that woman prosecutor,

231
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,450
I know her very well.

232
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,950
Just what do you mean?

233
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,320
At any rate, I'm counting on you.

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Wait!

235
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,420
Shoots!

236
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,430
Not too good, Kid.

237
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,930
Eavesdropping is a crime.

238
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,840
Bye, then.

239
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,840
He knew about Prosecutor Kujo to begin with?

240
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,130
What?

241
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,830
You have a phone call from suspect Takeuchi,

242
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,830
what would you like to do?

243
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay, I'll take it.

244
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
Number 3.

245
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,740
Hello. This is Kujo.

246
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,550
"Mouri Detective Agency"

247
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
"Takeuchi Construction Company Subject of Construction Scandal"

248
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,830
I found it, here it is!

249
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,630
What're you looking at, Conan?

250
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,730
Mr. Takeuchi's company

251
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,030
was scandalized for shoddy construction five years ago, wasn't it?

252
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,040
I wonder is that really true.

253
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,740
Yeah.

254
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,140
It was supposed to have evolved into

255
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,240
a case involving the political world too,

256
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,340
but the department head of the subsidiary design company

257
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,450
committed suicide and all vanished into smoke.

258
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,550
As a result, it seems that the senior prosecutor

259
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,250
was flown over to a remote district.

260
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,150
What about it?

261
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,420
Maybe it has nothing to do with what's happening now,

262
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,830
but I was just wondering around when Mr. Takeuchi got to know Ms. Kujo.

263
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,930
What? Takeuchi and Madonna knew each other from before?

264
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,130
Yes, he said so, at Ms. Kisaki's place.

265
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,140
He says he knows a lot about Prosecutor Kujo.

266
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,840
I haven't heard he's been arrested before, though.

267
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,540
Hey, Pops.

268
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,950
I watch a lot of news like these on TV

269
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,450
but doesn't the special investigation department handle cases like these?

270
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,450
I see!

271
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,550
If Madonna was in that special investigation department

272
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,320
and if Takeuchi was involved in the case...

273
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,530
Maybe there's something behind all this.

274
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,330
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

275
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,340
Oh, Ms. Kuriyama.

276
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,840
Yes, he's here.

277
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,240
Dad, it's from Ms. Kuriyama.

278
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,640
She says it's an emergency.

279
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,550
What's up?

280
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,050
What? Takeuchi died?

281
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,850
Just what do you mean?

282
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,320
How'd he die?

283
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,030
Ms. Kisaki, Mr. Mouri is...

284
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,440
Dear.

285
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,740
Hey, what's going on?

286
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
Is it true that Takeuchi died?

287
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,840
Yes.

288
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,450
He jumped off the veranda of his room on the sixth floor of this condo.

289
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,550
He seems to have died instantly.

290
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,050
He jumped?

291
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,150
You mean he committed suicide?

292
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,350
It seems to be so.

293
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,420
Absurd!

294
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,520
He was finally released and yet!

295
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,420
I realized that too!

296
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm confused myself.

297
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,930
Isn't there a possibility that it was an accident?

298
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,330
No, there isn't.

299
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,530
They even found a will.

300
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,430
Moreover, there's an eye-witness.

301
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,040
An eye-witness?

302
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,140

Please, at least let me offer him incense.

He said that he'd tell me the truth so to come over.

333
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,420
You mean the truth about his wife?

334
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,320
Or was he referring to the incident five years ago?

335
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,730
You knew about it?

336
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,000
You seem to have been a member of the special investigation team, right?

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

338
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It started off as the construction fraud of Takeuchi Construction Company.

339
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,100
But there seemed to be

340
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,410
a bribery case involving politicians behind the scene too,

341
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,510
so I was asked to help out.

342
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,210
If I remember correctly, the department head of the construction company

343
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,410
that was said to be the key to solving this case committed suicide,

344
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,220
and everything was thrown into ambiguity.

345
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,620
Yes.

346
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,020
One of the persons working under that department head was Takeuchi.

347
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,120
I see, so that's the story.

348
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,430
His testimony was supposed to have served as a breakthrough

349
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,800
to solving the entire case,

350
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,900
but he suddenly changed his story,

351
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,500
so we had no choice but to drop charges.

352
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,800
Then, he got married

353
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,000
and became the son-in-law of Takeuchi Construction Company

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,210
and became an executive.

355
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,610
And now, five years later,

356
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,010
that man appeared before you

357
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,310
as a suspect of a hit-and-run case.

358
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,620
I immediately suspected that he may have acted as a scapegoat for his wife.

359
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,520
I didn't want to overlook this opportunity!

360
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,230
That's why you pursued him on another case.

361
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,630
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,500
But if he called you to tell you the truth,

363
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,200
why did he commit suicide by jumping off the veranda?

364
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
I don't know either.

365
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,410
It sure is strange.

366
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,010
Will you tell me of how things were when he committed suicide?

367
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,520
That day, at 20:00, the appointed time,

368
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
I arrived at his condominium.

369
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,620
Hold on!

370
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,730
Thank you, you're a lifesaver.

371
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,330
Oh, prosecutor!

372
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,530
Are you going to see my husband?

373
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,200
Yes, sort of.

374
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Are you headed home now, Mrs. Takeuchi?

375
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,900
The thing is, I got a strange mail from my husband,

376
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
so I rushed back.

377
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,810
Strange mail?

378
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,710
Thank you for everything you did for me so far.

379
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,610
Please forget about me and find happiness.

380
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,620
It sure is a strange mail.

381
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,320
Dear? Where are you?

382
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,620
Dear?

383
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,920
Dear? What're you doing there?

384
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,630
Please, don't!

385
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,630
Prosecutor, please stop my husband!

386
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,000
Excuse me!

387
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,600
My husband is out on the veranda!

388
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,010
Mr. Takeuchi! Just what do you think you're doing?

389
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,010
Mr. Takeuchi!

390
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
Oh, no.

391
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,820
Dear!

392
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,200
It's strange

393
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,900
for him to commit suicide after calling the prosecutor

394
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
that's investigating him to come and see him.

395
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,510
Something's not right.

396
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,710
"The deceased, Takeshi Nezu"

397
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,710
"Third anniversary of my husband's death will be held on November 27th."

398
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,710
"Please drop in on me if you come around. - Kayoko Nezu"

399
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,720
"Take care of yourself. I hope you'll do a good job."

400
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,320
"Your former boss, Takeshi Nezu."

401
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,420
"Espa"

402
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,430
But really,

403
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,100
I still can't believe that Mr. Takeuchi committed suicide.

404
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,200
He jumped from the veranda right

405
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,400
in front of the eyes of his wife and the prosecutor,

406
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
so there's no doubt.

407
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,600
But,

408
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,310
he came here the night before he died

409
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,010
and was drinking in a very good mood.

410
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,710
In a very good mood?

411
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,710
Yes.

412
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,220
He was saying that he'd be a free man soon,

413
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,820
so maybe he'd take a trip abroad.

414
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,420
I mean he was just out on bail,

415
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,020
and his trial was still to come.

416
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,520
I said the same thing to him,

417
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,230
but he said the trial was no problem.

418
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,700
He was more concerned about getting a divorce and starting over again.

419
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,500
Unthinkable.

420
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,200
He supposedly loved her so much

421
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,800
that he turned himself in to the police as her scapegoat.

422
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,410
But he seems to have had arrangements for a divorce ready.

423
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,710
What's going on?

424
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,620
Something's fishy after all.

425
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,420
Why is Mr. Takeuchi dressed like this?

426
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,020
Besides, what is this...

427
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,220
Hey, Glasses Kid!

428
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,730
How dare you read somebody else's stuff again without permission?

429
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,300
I wonder why Mr. Takeuchi was dressed like this when he died?

430
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,500
Because why would a person who is planning to die

431
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,310
wear a suit as if he were going to go out?

432
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,510
He was planning to take a death dive journey,

433
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,410
so maybe that's why he wore a suit top.

434
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,810
But, his pants are jeans.

435
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,520
Maybe he was delirious before taking his death dive.

436
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Besides, by the stomach part and both knee parts of his clothes,

437
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,420
there is a mark that looks to be like something scraped against it.

438
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,430
I wonder what it is.

439
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,700
What do you think it is?

440
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,300
Something's strange about Mr. Takeuchi's suicide.

441
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,410
Who cares!

442
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,210
Keep your nose out of the business of adults!

443
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,210
Ouch!

444
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,310
But you borrowed the autopsy report

445
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,920
because you had your doubts too, right, Pops?

446
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,020
Shut up!

447
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,420
Dad, where are you going?

448
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,520
Pachinko!

449
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,820
Hey, Dad!

450
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,220
What about the investigation?

451
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Bricks are nowhere in sight.

452
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,300
Hey, Kid.

453
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,810
Remember? It was on the autopsy report.

454
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,310
There is a trace of a bruise on the back of his head

455
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,810
that seems to have been caused by hitting a brick.

456
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,610
I tell you, take a good look, will you?

457
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,110
By the mark of the body near his head,

458
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,420
there are plants surrounded by bricks.

459
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,820
But, if he hit the brick there,

460
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,420
wouldn't the plant be broken off too?

461
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,920
And the brick would be shattered too, wouldn't it?

462
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
He came falling from the sixth floor...

463
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,100
What on earth...

464
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,000
She says that she cannot bear living in the room

465
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,400
that she was living together with her husband in,

466
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,800
and has gone back to her parent's home.

467
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,400
It seems that she's going to be putting it out for sale.

468
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,710
Hey, Kid!

469
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,010
Okay, Mr. Mouri,

470
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,010
please return the key to the manager's office on your way home.

471
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,310
All right.

472
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,020
It's here, after all.

473
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,520
I wonder why this antenna is faced downward.

474
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,720
So, this is the veranda in question.

475
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,630
He jumped from here?

476
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,130
Where's the brick?

477
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,700
Soil.

478
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,500
I get it! It was probably switched

479
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,410
with the bricks where the plants were.

480
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,410
All that's left to figure out is how he was made to dive to his death

481
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,920
in front of Prosecutor Kujo's very eyes.

482
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
I get it!

483
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,820
Where? Where is it?

484
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,820
Was it already gotten rid of?

485
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,430
Darn.

486
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
I found it.

487
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,600
I've figured out

488
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,000
why the corpse was wearing the top of a suit,

489
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,210
why there were scrape marks by the stomach part and both knee parts,

490
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,810
as well as why the antenna was faced downwards

491
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,610
and why the metal was stretched out.

492
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,620
This is a murder case!

493
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,350
"Takeuchi Construction Company's Bribery Case"

494
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
What?

495
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,750
Attorney at law Kisaki is here.

496
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,010
Please let her through.

497
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,520
-This way. -Thank you.

498
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,420
Ms. Kujo.

499
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,720
May we go out somewhere?

500
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,830
Yes, sure.

501
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,230
Thank you for the other day.

502
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,830
Did you get information about Mr. Takeuchi?

503
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,230
Yes.

504
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,740
I heard charges have been dropped due to the death of the suspect.

505
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,740
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience I caused you, Ms. Kisaki.

506
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,850
By the way,

507
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,120
I heard you submitted an informal resignation,

508
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
but is it true?

509
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,220
Don't tell me that you're planning on quitting your job as prosecutor.

510
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,730
I pressured the suspect who turned himself in,

511
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,630
to the point of committing suicide

512
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,330
that I'm ready for whatever may happen to my job.

513
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,830
What are you going to do about the hit-and-run incident?

514
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,340
Another prosecutor

515
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,540
is preparing to set up evidence that his wife committed the crime.

516
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,540
You mean that's okay with you?

517
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,640
If under the law,

518
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,550
the truth is brought into the light,

519
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,220
my individual position is of no concern!

520
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,120
Even if that means letting the killer go free?

521
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Huh?

522
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,530
-Killer? -Yes.

523
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,730
There is suspicion that maybe Mr. Takeuchi was murdered

524
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,230
under the pretense of having committed suicide.

525
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,140
That... that can't be

526
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,340
because I saw him with my own eyes.

527
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
What did you see with your own eyes?

528
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,810
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

529
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,620
What was his wife doing at that time?

530
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,930
I don't know.

531
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,230
I was so absorbed in stopping Mr. Takeuchi back then,

532
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,630
that my attention was not on her at all.

533
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,740
Don't tell me that...

534
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,740
His wife had a motive of wanting to kill her husband.

535
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,840
You mean it was all planned out?

536
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,750
Setting an incumbent prosecutor up as eye-witness,

537
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,150
would ensure that investigation will follow through

538
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,520
with just a matter of procedure.

539
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,920
They would never perform an investigation

540
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
that would go right against the testimony of a prosecutor.

541
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,220
That's true.

542
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,930
Oh, my goodness.

543
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,730
That possibility didn't even cross my mind.

544
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,130
So, what are you going to do?

545
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,630
If you quit now,

546
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,530
it'll be exactly what the culprit wants you to do.

547
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,130
Are you sure you want it that way?

548
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,340
Ms. Kisaki, I'm sorry,

549
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,040
but if you'll excuse me, I must go!

550
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,240
I have to get back to work.

551
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,450
Hello, Mr. Sasaki,

552
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,750
will you please get together

553
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,820
the investigation reports of Mr. Takeuchi's case right away?

554
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,720
Yes. And, please contact the local police

555
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,420
and make an appointment with the police detective in charge too.

556
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,620
The defendant, Mariko Takeuchi,

557
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,830
on the same day late at night at around 23:00,

558
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,030
drove her own car,

559
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,930
and when she got to the Toriyacho intersection,

560
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,940
collided into the bicycle

561
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,140
driven by victim, Yasuyuki Matsukawa, who was crossing the street,

562
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,040
then hit-and-ran.

563
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,840
She then tells her husband,

564
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,650
Hiroaki Takeuchi to turn himself in to the police, in her place,

565
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,920
and attempts to free herself from the crime she committed.

566
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,520
After her husband commits suicide,

567
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,620
next they bring charges against her.

568
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,020
Maybe Madonna's upset at the mass media getting down on her,

569
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,630
that she's just trying to push her way through?

570
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,030
Hey, Conan. Wasn't the one who hit-and-ran, his wife?

571
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,630
Then, why is mom acting as her attorney?

572
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,740
I'm sure she has something in mind.

573
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,840
I wonder what she has in mind.

574
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,220
Is the defendant admitting the charges?

575
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,720
I am innocent!

576
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,320
She had the nerve to pressure my husband into committing suicide,

577
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,620
-and now, she dares brings charges against me too. -Order!

578
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,830
If you have any counterargument,

579
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,130
you will be given a chance to make a statement, so please do so then.

580
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,630
Please present your evidence,

581
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,030
Prosecutor.

582
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,740
Yes, Your Honor.

583
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,240
The evidence I'd like to submit

584
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,440
are the analysis report of the vehicle that collided,

585
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,340
the dactyloscopy report of the fingerprints left on the steering wheel,

586
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,540
the pieces of shattered glass collected from the site of the accident,

587
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,750
bits of the coating of the car,

588
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,810
and the result of the analysis report of the traces of paint

589
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,320
found on the victim's bicycle.

590
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,820
The dinner party ended at around 22:00,

591
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,920
and the president drove her own car home.

592
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,130
Thank you.

593
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,830
That will be all.

594
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,130
All right.

595
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,830
Will the attorney for the defendant cross-examine?

596
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,130
Yes, Your Honor.

597
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,240
Mr. Yajima, I'd like to just ask you one question.

598
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,440
Did you see the defendant drive her car?

599
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,140
No, because I was talking to one of our business partners.

600
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,550
Please answer only whether you saw or did not see the defendant.

601
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,720
I didn't see her.

602
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,020
That will be all.

603
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,120
Now I know why your fees are so high.

604
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,130
Your Honor!

605
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,830
The defense counsel would like to request a special witness.

606
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,030
Prosecutor.

607
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,640
A request was submitted today, just before the hearing,

608
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,440
anything on this?

609
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,940
I accept.

610
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,440
Will the special witness for the defense counsel,

611
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,250
Kogoro Mouri, come to the witness stand.

612
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,920
Prosecutor, is it really okay?

613
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,220
Yes, no problem.

614
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,120
Dad is taking the stand.

615
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,730
I guess I'll sit and watch what Pops is going to do.

616
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,090
Now, Mr. Mouri,

617
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,100
I hear you were an acquaintance of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi.

618
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,400
Yeah, although it was just that I used to see him

619
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,300
off and on at the pub I used go to.

620
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,000
At those times,

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,110
did Mr. Takeuchi ever drink and drive himself home?

622
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,910
No, not that I know of, not even once.

623
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:33,220
That's why when I heard that he got into a car accident after drinking,

624
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,720
an inspiration flashed through this seven-colored brain cell of mine!

625
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,690
After doing some investigation,

626
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,900
I started to suspect that maybe he turned himself in to protect his wife.

627
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,300
What made you think so?

628
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,200
Well, there were many reasons,

629
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,700
but the question here is why he took the blame in her place.

630
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,510
I've heard that he wasn't getting along with his wife.

631
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,610
He must've had a darn good reason for admitting

632
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,110
to have committed a crime he didn't do, in place of someone else.

633
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,920
Why did he do what he did?

634
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,620
The reason he did what he did was for freedom.

635
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,120
Freedom?

636
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,190
Yes, freedom.

637
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,190
He was already in a humiliating position

638
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,790
being that he married into the president's family.

639
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,400
But, after his father-in-law fell ill

640
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
and his wife took over the presidency,

641
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
he had to face her day in and day out every single day

642
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,100
at home as well as at the company.

643
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,500
I mean, that's like being thrown into jail.

644
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,010
Well, what I mean is...

645
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,610
In exchange to taking the blame for his wife's crime,

646
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,910
he wanted to divorce his bickering wife, and start a new life.

647
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,820
Will the defense counsel come here for a minute?

648
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,890
Prosecutor too, please.

649
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:50,390
Defense counsel, what are you trying to prove anyway?

650
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:56,400
Mr. Mouri's testimony sounds more in favor of the prosecution.

651
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
I would like to make clear

652
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,110
the emotional entanglement that existed between the couple.

653
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,110
Prosecution, any comments?

654
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,810
If that's what it takes to substantiate the murder case...

655
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,110
A murder case?

656
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,290
I see that there is a need to hear about this in more detail.

657
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,590
We will suspend eye-witness testimony for now

658
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,190
and court will be adjourned for 30 minutes!

659
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,790
Come with me, both of you.

660
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,600
Conan, where are you going?

661
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
To the restroom!

662
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,920
Please explain what is going on.

663
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,490
I'm sure you both understand that this court hearing

664
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,090
is only to pass sentence on a hit-and-run case.

665
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,190
Yes, of course.

666
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,800
However, this case and the case involving Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi

667
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
are very closely connected.

668
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,700
And solving that case

669
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,710
will very importantly influence the hearing of this case.

670
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,020
Okay.

671
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,120
If the prosecutor feels the same way,

672
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,990
let's have Mr. Mouri continue his testimony.

673
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,890
However,

674
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,990
if there is anymore commotion in court,

675
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,500
the court will be adjourned immediately.

676
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,900
Understood?

677
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,500
You, especially, Ms. Kujo.

678
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,200
Because you seem to be personally involved in this case.

679
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
I understand.

680
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,910
It's about time for Pops to go off the scene.

681
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,610
Order in the court!

682
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,820
We will resume the hearing.

683
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,020
I wonder where Conan went.

684
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,290
Will the witness resume testimony?

685
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,490
All right.

686
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Okay, it's time we get down to business.

687
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,600
Like I said a while ago,

688
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,100
Prosecutor Kujo was waiting for Mr. Takeuchi,

689
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,810
who turned himself in to the police, in place of his wife.

690
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,710
And, five years ago when he was pressed

691
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,510
to tell the truth about the construction fraud,

692
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,020
an idea flashed through his mind.

693
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,420
What kind of idea was that?

694
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,690
If the prosecution hasn't forgotten about the incident in the past,

695
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,590
he could use it to blackmail and make money.

696
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,200
In other words, not only would he be able to get a hold of freedom,

697
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,500
but also could maybe make a huge sum of cash.

698
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,200
One billion yen?

699
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,610
Just what do you mean?

700
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,710
The contract was for divorce and 30 million yen palimony, right?

701
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,910
I was in jail for a while, so I raised the price.

702
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,820
I could never dish out such a large sum of money!

703
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,220
If you don't want to, it's fine with me.

704
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,490
All I need to do is tell the prosecutor the truth.

705
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,490
I guess you can spend time in jail together with your sick father.

706
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,200
So, the will of wanting to kill

707
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,700
sprouted in Mrs. Takeuchi's mind.

708
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,600
Hey! Just what do you mean the will to kill?

709
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,710
Defendant! Order, please!

710
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,210
Witness, are you saying that the defendant

711
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,710
may be involved with the death of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi?

712
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,120
Exactly.

713
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,720
Your Honour!

714
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I would like you to consider this as a testimony

715
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,190
in relation to bringing into light the truth of the matter.

716
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,490
Just what're you talking about?

717
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,590
Aren't you supposed to be my lawyer?

718
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,500
Prosecution, any comments?

719
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,500
I agree as to bring to light the truth of the matter.

720
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,410
The witness may proceed.

721
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,310
Wait! Why would I do something like that?

722
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:01,710
Defendant! I will hear you out later.

723
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,210
Please proceed.

724
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,820
That day, Mr. Takeuchi calls Prosecutor Kujo and tells her

725
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,220
to come over because he wants to tell her everything.

726
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,290
Of course, I think it was just

727
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,290
a bluff to assure he gets the money he was after.

728
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,500
Talk about way from enough.

729
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,600
Do you think that I get to move

730
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,900
a large sum such as a billion yen just like that so easily?

731
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,210
Then, write me an I.O.U.

732
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,110
What?

733
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,010
The prosecutor will be here in two hours.

734
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,810
I wonder what I should tell her.

735
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,320
First, the truth of the hit-and-run case.

736
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,020
Then the trick behind the construction fraud

737
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,190
that occurred five years ago.

738
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,190
That's when Mrs. Takeuchi executed her scheme.

739
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,610
But, Mr. Mouri,

740
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,110
I heard that Mr. Takeuchi jumped off

741
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,320
right before the eyes of the witness.

742
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,320
When Mr. Takeuchi jumped from the veranda,

743
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,190
he was wearing a suit.

744
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,490
However, the pants he was wearing were jeans.

745
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,290
That's where the secret lies.

746
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,200
After killing her husband,

747
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Mrs. Takeuchi put the top of a suit on him

748
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,700
and rigged a wire hanger on his back.

749
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,010
She then carried his dead body to the veranda

750
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,010
and tied a rope to the tip of the wire hanger that was rigged to him.

751
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,110
The other end of the rope

752
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,910
was hooked onto the hook of the clothing pole of the ceiling

753
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,320
and pulled into the bedroom.

754
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
All she had to do later

755
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,920
was hide in the bedroom and pull the rope.

756
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,290
Then the body would be suspended from the ceiling

757
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,590
and looks as if it is standing on its own.

758
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,590
That's a lie! How can you say such things?

759
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,590
Defendant!

760
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,600
You will be given an opportunity to speak your mind later.

761
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,900
However,

762
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,000
even if would be possible to make the dead body stand in that situation,

763
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,410
wouldn't it be impossible to make it jump off?

764
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,910
Exactly.

765
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,510
In order to do so,

766
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,210
she would've had to not only suspend him from above,

767
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,920
but also pull him simultaneously from the front.

768
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,020
So, in order to pull the body from the front,

769
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,990
she used the BS antenna that is set up outside the veranda

770
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,690
and tied a rope around the chest of the body.

771
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,100
Then, she leaves the suicide note that was prepared beforehand

772
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,400
in the living room,

773
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,500
and waited for Prosecutor Kujo to come.

774
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,700
Hold on!

775
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,610
She pretended to have just come back from outside,

776
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,610
and went back into the room with Prosecutor Kujo.

777
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,010
Dear? Where are you?

778
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,210
Dear?

779
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,520
Dear? What're you doing there?

780
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,820
Please, don't!

781
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,490
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

782
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,000
It is most likely that because of the darkness of the veranda

783
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,300
and the shock of what was happening before her,

784
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,100
Ms. Kujo did not realize

785
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,610
the unnatural movements of Mr. Takeuchi,

786
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,610
or the suspicious way Mrs. Takeuchi was acting.

787
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,110
Cut out all that bull!

788
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,310
Where do you have such evidence?

789
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,020
The rope that was supposed to come off smoothly

790
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,320
probably got stuck to something.

791
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,690
Only the BS antenna of your room is bent downwards.

792
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,190
You can't tell when it got bent, can you?

793
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,690
It could've been bent before the incident.

794
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,000
A wire clothes hanger that was bent out of shape

795
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,700
was found in the closet of the bedroom.

796
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,100
It got bent, so I was planning on throwing it away.

797
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,100
Blood stains and hair

798
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,710
were found on the brick under the outdoor unit.

799
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,110
Don't be ridiculous!

800
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,510
I'm sure I got rid of the brick.

801
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,320
You switched it with the brick that was in the garden.

802
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,420
The brick that was used as the murder weapon

803
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,890
has already been confiscated

804
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,490
and is with the forensic officers right now.

805
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,590
Come on!

806
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,190
How dare you all pick on me?

807
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,090
-Order! -But...

808
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,200
Order! Defendant!

809
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,900
Court is adjourned for today.

810
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,710
The date of the next hearing will be decided upon discussion.

811
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,710
Prosecution is required to submit a petition

812
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,610
as to the separate murder case.

813
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,910
That will be all.

814
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,100
Hi, Ms. Kujo.

815
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,510
Thank you so much the other day.

816
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,010
I've gotten a pay-cut

817
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,210
and one month suspension from duty because of the case.

818
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

819
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,120
I was bawled out by my boss too.

820
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,590
But, I think it's a good chance for me to relax,

821
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,190
since I haven't had time off for quite a while.

822
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,490
Then, I guess you should forget all about work

823
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,700
and rest to your heart's content.

824
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,800
Yes, I will.

825
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,500
Prosecutor Kujo, where are you going

826
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,900
with a suitcase like that?

827
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,610
To Tottori.

828
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,910
It's been three years since my previous boss passed away,

829
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,010
so I thought I'd go visit his grave.

830
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,920
I see. Take care.

831
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,620
Goodbye, then.

832
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,990
I'll see you in court again.

833
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,590
You won't beat me next time!

834
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,090
The same here.

835
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,600
Goodbye.

836
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,500
I'm glad.

837
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,000
She seems to have returned to her normal self.

838
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,010
Yes.

839
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,510
The Madonna of Prosecution...

840
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,410
rises again!

841
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,820
Next Conan's Hint:

842
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,440
"Lift".

843
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,200
The next episode is about my sweet naive love story with Shinichi

844
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,160
in our intermediate school days.
