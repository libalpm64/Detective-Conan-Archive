1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,423
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:09,123
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:10,723
A robber steals and runs away.

4
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:13,823
When he is cornered, he disappears beyond time and space!

5
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:15,323
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:17,023
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,923
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:03,203
Here!

9
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:10,203
Tell Dr. Agasa this cell phone saved my life, will you?

10
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:13,403
So I guess she didn't find out

11
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:14,703
who you are.

12
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:16,703
Yeah, that was close though.

13
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,203
Seems Ran no longer thinks I'm Shinichi Kudo.

14
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,003
Well, I'm pretty sure I could hide it.

15
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:25,603
Who would believe a story about a guy

16
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:29,103
who got shrunk by a drug, right?

17
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,803
You better thank me.

18
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,403
You made it through

19
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,303
because I sent you so many e-mails to your cell phone

20
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:36,803
so that Ran would believe

21
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,703
that you were Conan.

22
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,703
Yeah.

23
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,803
More importantly, are you really sure that

24
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:45,203
she's not suspicious about you anymore?

25
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:46,903
Yeah.

26
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:49,203
That actually made my morning quite an ordeal, though.

27
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:54,003
Hey Conan, I didn't know you were that smart!

28
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,003
Or like...

29
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:58,503
Here! Extra rice for the future detective!

30
00:02:58,503 --> 00:02:59,603
Or like...

31
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:00,803
Conan, you have to hear this!

32
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:02,303
It's Shinichi's voice!

33
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,503
You've reached Shinichi Kudo.

34
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:08,203
I'm not available right now. Please leave a message after the tone.

35
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:09,203
Or like...

36
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,403
You told her the cell phone number?

37
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,403
Hey, don't worry!

38
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,003
I'll turn on the answerphone when I'm with her, okay.

39
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:21,003
Whatever you say, but you gotta be careful.

40
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,703
If she finds out who you are, then...

41
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,603
I know!

42
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:29,303
I'll keep her away from the Black Organization no matter what.

43
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:31,403
She's a strong girl, you know.

44
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,303
More than you think.

45
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:34,803
No, don't move!

46
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:36,103
Stop!

47
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:38,703
You mean, as in Karate?

48
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,903
Hey man! Look at that!

49
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:44,903
What is it?

50
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:48,203
Officer Takagi?

51
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:54,003
Officer Takagi is acting somewhat strange.

52
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,603
Looks like he's having a hard time.

53
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,303
There must be something going on!

54
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,403
Definitely!

55
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,003
All right.

56
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:12,503
Look, he went inside the jewelry store!

57
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,103
Don't tell me he's gonna rob that store.

58
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,303
What are you, stupid?

59
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,403
There's only reason men go to jewelry store.

60
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,403
To buy a present.

61
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:24,503
It could be for his mother, sister, wife or somebody else.

62
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:27,403
But his face was all red and looked restless when he went inside.

63
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,703
So probably it's for his girlfriend, I think.

64
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,503
Eighty thousand yen.

65
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:42,603
It's expensive after all.

66
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:45,603
I still have to pay the loan for the ring I bought last time.

67
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,203
But...

68
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,803
That must be it!

69
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:51,103
Trust me. Miwako was staring at this brooch.

70
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,403
She wasn't even blinking at all!

71
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:56,503
But you didn't hear this from me, okay?

72
00:04:56,503 --> 00:04:59,403
Look, coincidence makes girls believe in destiny

73
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,103
and that's where the love deepens!

74
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,703
Love...

75
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,403
Sir? Would you like to take a look at it?

76
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:09,803
No, thanks.

77
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:12,203
Is it a present for child?

78
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:13,303
What?

79
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,403
Child?

80
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:18,803
How about this? The one with lots of diamonds. What do you think?

81
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:21,903
Well, I think it's too gorgeous for Officer Sato.

82
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:23,703
Guys, how did you know that...

83
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:27,003
I remember Officer Sato was saying her birthday was in April!

84
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,903
The birthstone of April is diamond.

85
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:30,803
Then, this one is perfect!

86
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:31,903
Guys...

87
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:35,403
Who said I was buying Officer Sato a present?

88
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,003
Oh, so you're not?

89
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,803
You were right.

90
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:45,703
Sorry.

91
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:48,803
Actually, could I see that brooch, please?

92
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:50,403
Of course.

93
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:51,703
This is the one, right?

94
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:56,303
This is pretty good!

95
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:57,703
It's got a nice design too!

96
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:00,403
Oh, how nice for Officer Sato!

97
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,003
You think so?

98
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:14,303
"A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 1)"

99
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:20,903
Hey!

100
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:28,203
"Put the jewels in this bag!"

101
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:30,003
Jewel robbery?

102
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,603
What are you waiting?

103
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,003
Use your tranquilizer gun.

104
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,203
I can't.

105
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:39,003
He's wearing a helmet and a heavy coat,

106
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,903
the needle wouldn't go through.

107
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,803
We don't know whether it's a real gun or not.

108
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,603
I can't use my high-power kicking shoes

109
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,103
in this situation either.

110
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,803
Now, guys, go...

111
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,203
No, don't take that!

112
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,203
Yes!

113
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:05,303
Now!

114
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,403
"Police Sergeant, Wataru Takagi" -Police!

115
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,403
I was on patrol,

116
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:14,003
so there are several police officers in this area!

117
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,803
It would be best if you just give up

118
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,103
and throw down your weapon!

119
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:23,203
He smiled?

120
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,903
Wait!

121
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:33,603
Where are your officers? I don't see any!

122
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,203
Stop!

123
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:36,403
Of course, there's no officer!

124
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:38,103
What?

125
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:39,803
I'm off duty today!

126
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:42,703
That was a total bluff!

127
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,403
Where did he go?

128
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,603
Over there! He's climbing the stairs!

129
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,703
You're not gonna get away!

130
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,903
You guys stay here, okay?

131
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:22,103
Okay!

132
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,503
There's no way out.

133
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:30,203
Now.

134
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:32,503
Just put down your gun and...

135
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:37,003
Wait a second!

136
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:47,503
Oh, my God!

137
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,803
Did something fall?

138
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,703
Yeah. What was that huge noise?

139
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:54,103
You see anything?

140
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,203
No.

141
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:57,503
"Moving company" -Hey, somebody go up and check it!

142
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:01,003
Police.

143
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:02,703
Does this truck belong to you?

144
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:03,903
Yeah.

145
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:05,603
What happened?

146
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:08,603
It looks like something fell on the container.

147
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,803
Yeah. Actually...

148
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,803
What is going on? What was that noise?

149
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,203
Somebody's dead!

150
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:20,803
What?

151
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,203
That's what happened.

152
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:24,103
So, until the ambulance and the police come,

153
00:09:24,103 --> 00:09:26,803
please do not move anything including the stuff.

154
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:27,903
Stuff too?

155
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:30,903
Yes. We have to maintain the scene the way it is.

156
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,503
Oh, no. You can't do that!

157
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,403
Look, we have to move all the stuff in by today.

158
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,103
Okay, we'll wait until the ambulance comes,

159
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,803
but after that, you let us to do our job!

160
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:43,403
All right. Why don't I speak to your client, then?

161
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:46,303
Okay. Mr. Nekota should be in his office.

162
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,803
Hey, get him over here.

163
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:48,803
Sure.

164
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,203
What is this? What's going on?

165
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:53,503
Mr. Nekota, somebody's here for you.

166
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:56,203
"Sakanobu Nekota (51)" -You've barely moved anything yet.

167
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,903
Come on, hurry up!

168
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:01,603
Actually, a man fell on our moving truck so...

169
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,303
-A man? -Right.

170
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,403
So I'm wondering if you could stop moving your stuff for a while?

171
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:09,803
Okay, fine. Call your friends and do what you have to do. Just be quick!

172
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:12,103
You're not the only one who got a schedule, okay?

173
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,203
I guess it's our fault, isn't it?

174
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:17,303
Yeah. If we hadn't chase him down to the roof...

175
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:20,203
He wouldn't have had to jump off the building,

176
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:23,103
Come on.

177
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,103
We got an officer with no weapon and five kids.

178
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:29,103
Even if we did corner on the roof of the building,

179
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,803
he had a gun and he could've used it,

180
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:33,803
at least to threaten us and run away.

181
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:37,703
So you are saying that man planned to commit suicide from the beginning?

182
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,103
Yes.

183
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:43,203
Or maybe he was absolutely confident that he was not going to die.

184
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,803
Nonetheless, I think this case...

185
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:48,603
is not a simple jewel robbery.

186
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,703
It's not a suicide either.

187
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,784
So, you're saying that

188
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:04,784
you were chasing this guy who robbed the jewelry store

189
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:06,784
who happened to jumped off the building and killed himself?

190
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:07,984
Yes.

191
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:11,484
He went over the fence on the roof of this building.

192
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:14,884
And crashed onto the container of this truck right here.

193
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,184
What were you doing?

194
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,584
The media is gonna attack us again.

195
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:24,784
A reckless chase of a hero-wannabe officer led to an unnecessary death.

196
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,484
No way.

197
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,884
We weren't just a hero-wannabe!

198
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:31,384
We were chasing him all the way from the store!

199
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:34,784
We were doing really good until we cornered on the roof.

200
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:37,984
It happened all of a sudden.

201
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,284
There's no way we could stop him!

202
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,284
Right, Conan?

203
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,384
Yeah. He jumped off the building without any hesitation.

204
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,584
As if he planned to do it from the beginning.

205
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,384
I see. So...

206
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,884
You guys were there when the robber broke

207
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,684
into the jewelry store, correct?

208
00:11:56,684 --> 00:12:00,984
Yes, we saw Officer Takagi walking into that store.

209
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:05,184
Oh, Takagi goes to a jewelry store on his day off.

210
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,184
For what kind of occasion?

211
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:11,884
No, that was for...

212
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:16,184
I didn't know you liked jewelries and stuff, Takagi.

213
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:17,284
It's surprising!

214
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:21,884
It was for you, Officer Sato!

215
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:25,584
So, did you find any jewelry you like?

216
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:27,284
Actually...

217
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:30,184
The robber took it just before he bought it!

218
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,984
I dropped it on the floor.

219
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,384
Did the culprit take it with him?

220
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,384
Yeah, he picked it up

221
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:39,484
and put it in the pocket of his raincoat!

222
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,784
Then that thing is supposed be in his pocket still.

223
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:45,184
But the thing is, I went on the truck

224
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:47,484
and checked his pocket before you guys came.

225
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:50,684
But the brooch was not there at all!

226
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,484
A brooch.

227
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:55,484
It's a present for your mom, isn't it?

228
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,284
No, that's a present for you.

229
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,684
No way.

230
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:05,484
Well, perhaps, the robber threw it away or dropped it.

231
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,384
Or maybe it just popped out of his pocket when he fell on the container.

232
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:12,584
In either case, I think you should forget about that brooch.

233
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,784
Even if it's found, prosecutors will keep it for a while

234
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:19,184
since it's material evidence.

235
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:23,184
Who would want a jewelry that has a bloody past anyway, right?

236
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:24,984
That's true.

237
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:28,984
Well, I wouldn't mind at all.

238
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:31,684
Even if it's got someone's blood on it, you can just wipe it off.

239
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:32,984
Jewelries have nothing to do with crime.

240
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:34,284
Yeah, that's what I thought!

241
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:38,084
Oh, also, there're some other strange things.

242
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,684
The robber was wearing a helmet,

243
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:43,084
but there's no way he could bleed that much on his head.

244
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,784
Unless he removed his helmet while falling down.

245
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:53,084
I see.

246
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:54,184
And one more thing,

247
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:57,184
When Officer Takagi said "police" to the robber in the store,

248
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:00,484
the robber actually smiled.

249
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:04,084
As if he was waiting for the police officers to come!

250
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,484
Smiled?

251
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:07,684
-Are you sure? -Yes.

252
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,584
If he did smile,

253
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:12,784
then that means he was well prepared for his getaway.

254
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:15,384
Maybe there was something that supposedly guaranteed his life

255
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:18,484
even after jumping off the building.

256
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:22,184
So, removing his helmet while falling down

257
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,784
was actually a part of his escape plan?

258
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:28,784
I don't know. Anyway, we have to identify the dead body first.

259
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,484
Sir, you can't come in!

260
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:32,884
No, he looks like someone that I know.

261
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,484
Oh! It's really Mr. Atomura after all!

262
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:36,484
What?

263
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,884
I own a restaurant over there,

264
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,084
and he was one of the regular customers.

265
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:44,084
I think he's working for Mr. Nekota's company.

266
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,584
Nekota?

267
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,884
Do you know him?

268
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:50,784
Yes. The robber fell on the moving truck

269
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:56,484
which was carrying the stuff of Mr. Nekota, the man over there.

270
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:01,284
Mr. Atomura?

271
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:02,784
He's Mr. Atomura!

272
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,184
Why did you?

273
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,784
Okay, so he is one of your staff, right?

274
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,284
Yes, until last week though.

275
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,684
Until last week?

276
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:15,484
He had been working for me since the company was established,

277
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:17,184
but we're facing some financial difficulties right now,

278
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,384
so I had to make him leave unfortunately.

279
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,384
It was necessary because our company needs to scale back.

280
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:25,884
But I didn't know it was going to end up like this.

281
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:29,084
So the fact you're moving today is also for the scale back?

282
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,184
You got that right.

283
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:34,784
This building's got a smaller space but also a cheap rent.

284
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:38,084
Where was the previous office by the way?

285
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:41,784
It's the building, right across this one, on the top floor.

286
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,384
It's really close.

287
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:49,584
Then, shall we go and see the previous office?

288
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,784
Why do you need to?

289
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,784
Because if he did plan to commit the robbery,

290
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:59,084
then maybe there are clues about his plan in your office, right?

291
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,584
I understand.

292
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,684
Hey, sir.

293
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:06,184
Have you met these officers before?

294
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:08,684
No. Why would I have?

295
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,484
I've never done anything bad before!

296
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:18,984
"Nekota Food Import Company" -This was Mr. Atomura's locker.

297
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:22,884
And this is the desk he was using before.

298
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:24,284
I see.

299
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,184
You got a lot of things in this office still.

300
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:31,084
Yes, we decided to buy new lockers, desks and chairs

301
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:33,084
to make a clean start.

302
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,584
So that's why things are still here.

303
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:38,884
It seems there's nothing that's related to the robbery.

304
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:41,084
There's nothing in his desk too.

305
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,484
But, it's kind of strange, I think.

306
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,984
This man was fired a week ago,

307
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:48,184
but a lot of his stuff is still in this office.

308
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:49,484
Oh that.

309
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:53,784
I didn't want the workers to be upset over the dismissal.

310
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:56,784
So I decided to keep it secret until our new company gets stable,

311
00:16:56,784 --> 00:17:00,684
I told them he was on a business trip.

312
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,584
I asked him to come and get his stuff

313
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,584
after moving the office, secretly.

314
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,684
Hey, look!

315
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:08,184
Isn't that the truck that the guy crashed?

316
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,184
Oh, yeah, it is!

317
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:11,584
We can see the truck in front of this building.

318
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,684
That means this place is right across

319
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:15,084
the building that the robber jumped off.

320
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:20,584
Maybe he was trying to make a jump from there to here.

321
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,784
What do you think?

322
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,384
That's impossible.

323
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,284
He was holding a bag of jewelries, remember?

324
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:30,984
Even the world-class long jumpers can go around nine meters or so.

325
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,484
A normal person wouldn't even think about jumping off,

326
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,884
unless he was like your superhero, Masked Yaiba.

327
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,284
What's wrong with you?

328
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:40,884
Masked Yaiba will never steal things!

329
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,084
Yeah, you're right.

330
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,284
Hey, guys.

331
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,984
Look, you can't go there.

332
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:47,384
Hey, can I ask you something?

333
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:48,784
Where were you when the moving people got here?

334
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,984
I was in my house that's below this room.

335
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,184
Your house?

336
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:55,284
I see.

337
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:02,584
Below that office is his living space.

338
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,484
That office is four stories above which is the ninth floor.

339
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,084
So this house is on the fifth floor.

340
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:11,084
-What is this? -It's a strange helmet, isn't it?

341
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,084
Hey!

342
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,484
Is that for a sports bicycle?

343
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:18,584
Yes, I was into triathlon when I was young.

344
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,784
Are you done now?

345
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,884
Look, we knew each other for a long time,

346
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:24,784
but there's nothing that belongs to him in here!

347
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,584
Oh, I'll get it.

348
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:34,484
Hi. How can I help you?

349
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:38,184
People told me that police officers are here.

350
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,484
Something happened?

351
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:43,884
Oh, Officer. You know there was a jewel robbery over there, right?

352
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:47,084
I just thought that this is something about it.

353
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:52,084
My name is Isaka. I'm living on the sixth floor.

354
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,284
Three days ago, around 2 am midnight...

355
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:56,784
I woke up because I heard this noise from the window.

356
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:58,884
And when I looked at it,

357
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:02,484
there was a thin long stick shadow, on the curtain!

358
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:06,284
So I woke my husband up right away.

359
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:09,284
He checked the terrace, but nothing was there.

360
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,784
My husband said it was just a dream,

361
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:16,084
but I thought I should tell you guys about this.

362
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,984
Is your house right above this house?

363
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:23,484
Yeah. It's number 605, just right above.

364
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,784
Then, did you hear the same noise

365
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,584
when there was the robbery over there?

366
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,984
No, because I was watching TV.

367
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,584
Honestly, I didn't even know about the robbery

368
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,884
until I heard the police car siren.

369
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,784
Excuse me.

370
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:39,684
Is it okay if we start moving the stuff now?

371
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:43,584
Looks like we need to take two or three more trips to move everything.

372
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,284
Two or three more trips?

373
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,884
From the old office?

374
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,084
Yes, we got a lot of stuff

375
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,984
because the whole ninth floor was our office.

376
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,084
We got storage, meeting room and all that.

377
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,184
Well, we're not totally done with your old office,

378
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,184
but it seems it really was a suicide.

379
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,584
True, we got the pictures of the scene,

380
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,084
and the fake gun the robber used to threaten people.

381
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,284
We also got the jewelries back.

382
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,084
Except that brooch,

383
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:10,484
because everything was in the bag.

384
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:12,584
So I think you can start moving now.

385
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:16,084
But you leave the cover on the container.

386
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,184
You can start now, but once you're done,

387
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,784
the police going to take the truck for a while, okay?

388
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,084
Okay.

389
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:25,384
-All right, let's get to work! -Okay.

390
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:26,684
Hey, wait! Hold on!

391
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:33,084
Where did you guys park the truck when you were moving the stuff

392
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:35,384
from the old office to that container?

393
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,184
We parked the truck

394
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:38,584
"Movers destination. Former office" -at the back of this building.

395
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,584
"Movers destination. Former office" -That's where the back entrance is.

396
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:43,284
We used the back street when we carried the stuff

397
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,184
just to avoid the crowd.

398
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,684
Did you hear anything when you were there?

399
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:49,484
Yeah, I heard a noise.

400
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,484
What kind of noise?

401
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,584
That was jackhammer from the water supply work

402
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,284
they've been doing since last week.

403
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:58,284
That was annoying.

404
00:20:58,284 --> 00:21:00,084
"Back Door" -Noise of water supply work.

405
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,784
"Mr. Nekota's house" -The back street is narrow

406
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,484
and does not have many passersby as well.

407
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,284
"The place culprit jumped down"

408
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,084
What's also annoying was the Nekota guy.

409
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,884
He told us what to do like a kindergarten teacher!

410
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:13,884
Yeah. He told all of us, including the driver,

411
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:17,584
to come upstairs, just to teach us which thing goes first and stuff.

412
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:21,784
We also had to wait for a while in front of his office, you know?

413
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:24,384
Plus, he canceled us twice in a row.

414
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,984
Canceled?

415
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,484
We were actually supposed to do the moving the day before yesterday,

416
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,984
but he called us that morning and said he can't make it.

417
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:33,784
Yesterday was too. It was a nice day.

418
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:35,884
Actually, it really was a perfect day for moving.

419
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,284
Well, he booked us for three days just in case

420
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:40,384
he might have to cancel.

421
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,084
Sure the pay was good but...

422
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:44,384
We don't wanna work for a guy like him ever again.

423
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,384
I get it! It's the rain!

424
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,484
Thank you so much! Good luck with the moving!

425
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,084
Hey, Conan!

426
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,084
Where is the bedroom?

427
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,584
I found it!

428
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:01,584
It's here!

429
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:05,484
If my deduction is correct...

430
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,584
Then, probably...

431
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:10,984
It's wet!

432
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:17,284
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

433
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:21,584
Mr. Atomura was murdered by Mr. Nekota,

434
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:25,084
who disguised the murder as suicide.

435
00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:32,184
With the time lag and the gap between the buildings.

436
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:34,311
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,311
"Rain"

438
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:38,811
With this brooch, I'll approach Ms. Sato!

439
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,011
That's not funny.

440
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,111
It isn't?
