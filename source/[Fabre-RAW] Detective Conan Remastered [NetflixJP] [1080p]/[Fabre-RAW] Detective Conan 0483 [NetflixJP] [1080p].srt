1
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:05,052
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:06,852
After the tears is "A Ramen Shop Owner".

3
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:08,452
He was definitely there, but has disappeared.

4
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:11,252
What is the identity of the outrageous police officer?

5
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:12,652
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:14,352
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:16,052
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,795
It was in the morning, the first Monday of the month.

9
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,595
Where are those guys?

10
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:04,195
Man! They're late.

11
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:05,895
Genta!

12
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,895
Hey! Hurry up!

13
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,195
Genta!

14
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,195
What is it?

15
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:14,095
What's this about some great information you have for us?

16
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:19,795
So, did you guys see the Saturday Drama last night?

17
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:23,795
You mean, "Run! The 100 Police Officer Dragnets"?

18
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,395
Yeah! That's the one!

19
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,595
Well, I saw it, but... So?

20
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,195
What's up with the show?

21
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:31,595
As soon as I saw it, I came straight here.

22
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:35,795
Here, Beika Park, is where they shot that show! No doubt about it!

23
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:38,895
That's it? Anyone could have told you that!

24
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:41,395
Yeah, I knew it was this park as soon as I saw the show.

25
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,795
-What? -"There's some case in the park!"

26
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:48,195
As soon as I heard the main character

27
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,095
say that lame line.

28
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,595
I knew the show was shot right there.

29
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:56,795
It was just a bud when it was filmed.

30
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:59,895
So they shot the show about a couple of weeks ago, perhaps.

31
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:03,195
So, Genta saying he had something great to tell us was true after all.

32
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,795
Yeah.

33
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:08,695
I thought I was the only one who knew that they shot the show here!

34
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,895
You know, turning it all into a drama is just the worst, you know?

35
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,795
Really.

36
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:20,595
They were just trying to make things look cool

37
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:21,895
by having a scene with a whole bunch

38
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:26,095
-of uniformed officers. -Enough. No more about that show.

39
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:27,795
Hey, Yasuyo!

40
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:30,495
Ayumi, how's everything?

41
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,695
Good.

42
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:33,195
This is Yasuyo Akimoto.

43
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:35,395
"Yasuyo Akimoto (24)" -She is living in 3-chome now,

44
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,395
but before, she lived in an apartment close to me.

45
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,095
So, Yasuyo, you were out shopping?

46
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,495
Oh, this?

47
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:43,895
They're just some sweets I had sent that my hometown is famous for making.

48
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,695
I was thinking of giving some to this police officer.

49
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:48,595
A police officer?

50
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,895
I don't know his name,

51
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,095
but he seems like a really decent guy.

52
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:00,895
Even if he does have a beard.

53
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,395
So, he's got a beard?

54
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,895
I'd like to see this guy.

55
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:13,995
-Right, Conan? -Yeah.

56
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,895
"Komehana Station"

57
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:17,495
"Komehana Station Police Box" -You've never seen that kind

58
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,695
of police officer?

59
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,795
He has a beard and wears glasses.

60
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,195
Yeah, there's no such police officer

61
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:26,795
in the Komehana Police Department, and of course this police box.

62
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:30,895
But I, when you were on patrol, we would see each other all the time.

63
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,995
But, that's when I'm not at the station.

64
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,595
What's going on?

65
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:36,695
Hard to say.

66
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:40,395
-Just what is going on here? -Just as I thought.

67
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:44,995
There's no way a beard is allowed under the police dress code.

68
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,995
Therefore, this guy is only posing as a police officer.

69
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:56,095
"The Police Officer Who Disappeared"

70
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,595
Man, oh man!

71
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02,695
Do you have to call on me so often?

72
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,095
Yeah, but you're the only one we can depend on.

73
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,095
What with officer impersonators in the police department.

74
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,495
Isn't this a big deal?

75
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,695
Officer impersonators?

76
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,795
Impersonating an officer of the law,

77
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:20,695
even for a con artist, is the lowest of the low.

78
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,995
Ms. Akimoto, you've seen this man a number of times before, right?

79
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,695
Yeah.

80
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:29,195
Things were busy at work, and I had been staying late this whole week

81
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:33,795
up until yesterday, I was coming home every night on the last train.

82
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:38,095
I first met that police officer the first night I stayed late at work,

83
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,495
it was late Monday night.

84
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:41,795
I had just gotten off the last train home,

85
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,195
and was heading towards my house in the third chome.

86
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:47,395
It's not safe for a woman to be walking outside alone so late, you know.

87
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,995
You take care, OK?

88
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,195
Then, the next day, and the next.

89
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:58,295
Well, at any rate, for the week, every night

90
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:01,195
when I was coming home from work,

91
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,995
I ran into this officer one of the nights,

92
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,995
he was helping this elderly couple.

93
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:09,995
You know, it's not safe. You really shouldn't be walking around at night.

94
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,995
Well, she was the one who up and said that she wants some soda.

95
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:15,395
You were the one who said you could go for some custard.

96
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,695
Good evening!

97
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,695
Good evening, ma'am.

98
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:23,295
Last night, he was helping a drunk guy.

99
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:27,995
Hey, watch it, watch it. Your house far from here?

100
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:30,995
You know, you'd better take a cab home.

101
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:34,495
I'm fine! I can make it home on my own!

102
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,395
But you're not fine. Oh, here we go. Let's get you up.

103
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:40,595
You always seem to have your work cut out for you.

104
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,795
Well, it's just that... It's my job, ma'am.

105
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:44,395
You be careful yourself, OK?

106
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:45,995
Yes, sir!

107
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:48,695
Listening to all of this, he sounds like an absolute dream.

108
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:52,795
No kidding, right? How can this guy not be an officer?

109
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:55,495
Yeah, but, why did he go through all of the trouble

110
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:59,095
of pretending to be a police officer?

111
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:01,095
Yeah, why'd he do it?

112
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:03,895
I think he was pretending to be a police officer

113
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:07,195
and planning some sort of bad thing!

114
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:08,995
What do you mean, 'bad thing'?

115
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,795
Well, I'm not quite sure yet.

116
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:16,095
Hello. This is...

117
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:18,895
So you say you had a break-in the other day.

118
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:21,095
No, we still haven't caught the guy yet.

119
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,095
Considering the MO,

120
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,795
it looks like the work of the same guy

121
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,795
committing all of the other break-ins

122
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,095
that have been going on for about a week.

123
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:30,095
So it's a break-in crime spree?

124
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:33,495
So, someone must have seen this guy.

125
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,195
Like the old couple, or perhaps the drunk guy.

126
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,195
That's it!

127
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,895
One of them might help shed some light on all of this!

128
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:40,995
Ms. Akimoto,

129
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,895
do you know where any of these people might be?

130
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,295
I don't know about the drunk guy from last night,

131
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:46,995
but as far as the elderly couple goes,

132
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:49,695
I've seen them a number of times at Tetsuryu.

133
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,195
Tetsuryu?

134
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:53,095
"Tetsuryu"

135
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:54,895
"Tetsuji Odawara (33)"

136
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,495
Police officer impersonator?

137
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,695
-He looks really upset, right? -Totally.

138
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:02,795
I'm not upset! It's nothing.

139
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,995
The guy who runs the place isn't the most easy-going person in the world,

140
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:07,395
but he does make great ramen, for sure.

141
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:10,095
So that's why I always come here to eat.

142
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:12,595
See, right here.

143
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,195
You're right.

144
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:19,195
So this is it. The secret ingredient!

145
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,195
Hey, you can't do that.

146
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,995
No.

147
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:28,195
Oh, my goodness. Genta, you got it all over me.

148
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,895
The sauce spilled out?

149
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:34,795
It's like I've been swimming in ramen.

150
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:38,495
-Genta! -It's not like I did it on purpose!

151
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:42,495
So, do you think you might know anything

152
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,195
that might help us find this officer impersonator?

153
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:47,795
Sometimes I see that old couple in here.

154
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,895
They seem to really like you.

155
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,495
The Takayanagis?

156
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:54,195
Yeah, they live...

157
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:58,295
That's them.

158
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:00,995
Police officer impersonator?

159
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:04,195
There has to be some sort of mistake? Right?

160
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,095
Yes, you're right.

161
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,195
He was such a kind and gentle police officer.

162
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,595
Is that so?

163
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,595
So he has a good reputation in this place.

164
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,595
I don't think what people say could get any better.

165
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:19,595
Who on earth is this guy?

166
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,695
Detective Takagi.

167
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,495
Just now, I heard of another burglary

168
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:27,395
at a home late last night in the second chome.

169
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:31,195
There was some talk earlier about a spate of burglaries?

170
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,395
Yes. So this officer impersonator seems to be showing his true colors.

171
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,895
Pretending to be on patrol,

172
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:38,095
he's looking for houses that he can break into,

173
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:40,895
then robbing people blind.

174
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,195
You mean...

175
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,395
A burglar?

176
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:48,395
There is a possiblity that that's what is happening.

177
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:49,695
No, it can't be.

178
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:52,695
I just cannot believe that he would be doing such terrible things!

179
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:56,595
Then, for what reason do you think he posing as a fake police officer?

180
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,195
Officer Arai.

181
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:02,195
No, I think the one who broke into the house is someone else.

182
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:10,195
I'm going to the scene of the crime.

183
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,195
Excuse me.

184
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,995
I thought you were a really nice police officer.

185
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:20,095
Yasuyo.

186
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:22,795
It's no wonder people lose trust in others.

187
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,995
Good luck looking for the fake police officer.

188
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:27,195
What about you, Haibara?

189
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:29,395
I pass.

190
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:35,695
So the fake police officer was a thief.

191
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,595
No, he somehow doesn't fit the profile

192
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,495
that Yasuyo and the others are giving us.

193
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:42,595
-Right! -We've got to look for the person

194
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:43,995
who witnessed the fake police officer.

195
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,895
We've got no choice but to gather whatever information we can.

196
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,395
I guess you should find out

197
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,995
where he got the police officer's outfit from, too, right?

198
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,995
Right, but that's strange, too.

199
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,195
If a police officer's outfit were to be stolen,

200
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:59,095
there should already be a big fuss, but...

201
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,295
It's hard to get hold of the real thing,

202
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:03,795
but if it's one that was used to shoot a drama or something?

203
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,295
Something used for a drama?

204
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,495
-That's it! -That's it!

205
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,195
What do you mean?

206
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,795
The 2-hour drama that you broadcasted last night.

207
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:17,495
Yes, "Run! The 100 Police Officer Dragnets".

208
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,295
Could you please check to see

209
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:22,595
if a set of one of the police outfits used back then is missing?

210
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:25,195
While waiting for the TV station to get back to us,

211
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:29,995
we gathered eye-witness information on the bearded police officer.

212
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,595
As a result...

213
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:35,695
That fake police officer first appeared a week ago,

214
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,095
from Monday last week, right?

215
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:43,095
Last Monday is when Yasuyo began working over-time, right?

216
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:44,795
Yeah, now that you mentioned it.

217
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:48,495
Besides, there are no witnesses who saw that fake policeman during the day.

218
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:50,695
He only appears late at night.

219
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:52,995
Just when the last train pulls into Beika Station.

220
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:54,595
Does that have any meaning?

221
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,495
One person said that

222
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:57,895
he saw the policeman in front of the Beika Station.

223
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:59,995
There are 5 eye-witness reports in 2-chome.

224
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,895
Moreover, there are three reports in 3-chome.

225
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,695
If we trace all the eye-witness reports.

226
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:09,495
It's the road that Yasuyo who lives in 3-chome takes to walk home.

227
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,595
True!

228
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,595
In other words, the period of time and place

229
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,295
that the fake police officer started appearing...

230
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:18,295
Is connected to Yasuyo Akimotos over-time work?

231
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,295
That's right.

232
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,595
And do you remember what she said?

233
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:24,695
At any rate, I've seen that police officer every night

234
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:27,395
on my way home from work this past week.

235
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:30,095
It can't be coincidence that she saw every day for a week...

236
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:34,095
The fake police officer appeared before Yasuyo deliberately?

237
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:36,395
I don't know for what reason though.

238
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,795
But, if so,

239
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,395
it's understandable why he wore a beard and glasses.

240
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:42,295
I see! He disguised himself!

241
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,295
Does that mean that the Yasuyo Akimoto

242
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,395
knows the real face of the fake police officer?

243
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:49,195
You mean the fake police officer is someone who is intimate with Yasuyo?

244
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,095
And just who could that be?

245
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:54,995
-What makes you think I would know? -Oh, you don't know.

246
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,795
Oh, come on! Not again, Genta.

247
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:00,395
-Did it get on your dress? -Where's my handkerchief?

248
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:01,795
Did you drop it?

249
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,695
It could be at that ramen shop.

250
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:06,295
Im afraid to go to that shop alone.

251
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,095
We'll all go with you.

252
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:10,195
Right, Conan?

253
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,295
"Preparation"

254
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,695
Maybe he's not in after all?

255
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:20,695
Yes.

256
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,395
Of Nichiuri TV.

257
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:23,795
And, how was it?

258
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,595
Yes.

259
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,395
It seems he went out a while ago.

260
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,895
Maybe he went home for lunch or something?

261
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,995
He seems to live very close to Beika Park.

262
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,095
What do you want to do? Do you want to wait?

263
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:38,895
I found it.

264
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:40,895
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:44,195
Thank you so very much.

266
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:45,995
About the police officers outfit,

267
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:48,595
they checked on it and found one missing.

268
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,795
So, he got hold of the fake police officers uniform

269
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,095
when they were shooting the film at Beika Park after all.

270
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,195
Most likely.

271
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,595
It was on a Sunday a half a month ago, yeah.

272
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,295
Was that film shot on a Sunday a half a month ago?

273
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,295
That's what they said, but what about it?

274
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:06,695
It was the 3rd Sunday last month, wasn't it?

275
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:10,195
It just so happens to be the day this shop is closed.

276
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:14,095
You said that the man who works here lives near Beika Park, right?

277
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:15,695
-Yes. -If it was his day off,

278
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,195
he could've gone to watch the shooting of the film.

279
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:19,595
I'm sure anyone would,

280
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,595
if they're shooting a film for a flashy drama right close by.

281
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,595
If he wanted to, I'm sure there was a chance for him

282
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,395
to steal the police officers uniform.

283
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,395
And the fake police officer is someone close enough to Yasuyo

284
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:31,295
that she knows his face.

285
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,795
Conan, don't tell me that...

286
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:34,395
He is the fake police officer?

287
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:37,295
-Really? -But, why would he?

288
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:39,295
Conan?

289
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,295
Maybe...

290
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,610
"Publisher"

291
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,610
Then, is that man the one who choose that picture?

292
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,710
Yes, he seems to have said that

293
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,810
he wants to use this picture on the magazine.

294
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,910
She looks really good in this picture, doesn't she?

295
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,610
Does he like her? Maybe that's why he chose this picture.

296
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,210
I see. It was about her.

297
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,110
His name is Tetsuji Odawara.

298
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,610
The fact is, he's was my classmate in high school.

299
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,910
And, after the interview, when we were drinking together...

300
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,410
You mean you have somebody you care for?

301
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,210
But, it'll end in one-sided love.

302
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,610
Why?

303
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,710
I mean, my looks are not the greatest.

304
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,310
Come on, you're just psyched into thinking that way.

305
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,810
I don't mind, as long as I can watch over her without being noticed.

306
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,910
I tell you...

307
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,610
Odawara's face looks grumpy when he's not talking,

308
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,510
so at first glance he seems difficult to approach.

309
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,410
But in fact, there couldn't be a nicer guy around.

310
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,610
And he's also a very timid guy.

311
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,610
At Tetsuryu?

312
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,310
Yes, I did, with an acquaintance.

313
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,410
It seems that I'm going to have to start working over-time

314
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,210
from the end of this month.

315
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,810
Oh, gosh.

316
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,110
I mean it's quite dangerous coming home every night on the last train.

317
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,910
I think it was about a half a month ago.

318
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,610
So, that's what he heard.

319
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,910
Anything?

320
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,410
So, the fake police officer that you saw every night

321
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,310
wasn't there to steal something from you after all.

322
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,210
Did you find out?

323
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,610
All we have for now is circumstantial evidence.

324
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,410
But, we're going to confirm things with the person himself from now.

325
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,510
He is worry because he heard that

326
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,710
the woman he cared for was going to have to come home late

327
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,010
for a week.

328
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,310
He probably wanted to watch over her in secret if at all possible.

329
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,210
But because he thinks that his looks are frightening,

330
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,710
he figured that if he did something like that,

331
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,910
she would misunderstand him for being a weirdo,

332
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,410
so he decided against it.

333
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,710
"Close" -But, soon after that.

334
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,110
The incident happened at the park!

335
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,310
And, he saw the police officers outfit at the park.

336
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,710
It's at that time that he thought up a way

337
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,610
to guard Yasuyo fair and square.

338
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,910
So, he appeared before Yasuyo as a police officer.

339
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,810
Walking the streets at night is dangerous.

340
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,510
Please be very careful.

341
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,910
He's not back yet.

342
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,310
I wonder what happened?

343
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,210
Maybe he fled?

344
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,010
No. Maybe he...

345
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,710
is planning to catch the thief with his own hands

346
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,610
for the sake of Yasuyo who believed in his innocence.

347
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,310
That's too reckless and dangerous.

348
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,410
Let's split up and look for him!

349
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,510
Okay...

350
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,110
Hey! You kids.

351
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,710
It's impossible to begin with

352
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,410
because even if I want look for the thief,

353
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,010
I've got no clue to go on what so ever.

354
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,710
I can go home! I'm fine!

355
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,410
Oh, so he's the guy I saw yesterday.

356
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,310
I haven't eaten ramen and yet I smell like I did.

357
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,410
The smell of his clothes.

358
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,010
He's not here.

359
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,310
Where did he go?

360
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,110
Do you remember me?

361
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,510
We saw each other last night.

362
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,010
Last night?

363
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,810
I'm sorry, I was really wasted last night, you see...

364
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,510
Yes, you really smelled of alcohol back then.

365
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,810
But, it was your clothes that smelled,

366
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,110
not your breath.

367
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,610
Just what are you talking about?

368
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,510
You staggered along as if you were drunk

369
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,510
and went looking for a house you could break into!

370
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,610
Don't move!

371
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,610
Stand right there!

372
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,610
Stop! You thief!

373
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,110
Thief?

374
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,910
Stop!

375
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,110
Get out of my way!

376
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,110
I would like to question you regarding the series of thefts

377
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,110
that have been occurring lately.

378
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,210
Okay.

379
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,610
Officer Arai, can you take care of him for me.

380
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,810
Yes, sir.

381
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,310
You're Mr. Tetsuji Odawara?

382
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,310
Yes.

383
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,410
Yasuyo.

384
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,510
Who on earth are you?

385
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,910
Ms. Akimoto, he is...

386
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,510
In order to protect

387
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,310
a woman going home late at night,

388
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,810
in order to see that she gets safely home,

389
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,610
you became a fake police officer, right?

390
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,310
How did you know that?

391
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,910
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,610
But, you know, sir, a person whos not a police officer

393
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,210
should never disguise as a police officer.

394
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,310
No matter what the reason is.

395
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,510
Do you understand

396
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,610
what Conan just said?

397
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,510
You did it the wrong way.

398
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,610
Yasuyo.

399
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,810
I'm arresting you for faking identity

400
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,610
and stealing the outfit.

401
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,610
Shall we go then?

402
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,910
Wait.

403
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,010
I'll go to eat ramen again.

404
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,510
"Tetsuryu"

405
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,810
Really!

406
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,910
It was his first time stealing something

407
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,710
and he didn't steal the uniform to carry out a crime.

408
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,110
He was acquitted considering that

409
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,910
he also captured the thief.

410
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,810
Of course he was severely reprimanded.

411
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,610
In other words, he was scolded very severely.

412
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,110
Thank you for waiting!

413
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,110
Thank you.

414
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,810
A man and woman

415
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,963
who are awkward at living a smooth life despite their age.

416
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:56,863
I don't think those two would like to hear something like that from you.

417
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:58,906
Did you say something?

418
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,906
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,206
"A whole lot of sweat"

420
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:54,706
I'm sweating so much that I might drown.

421
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:56,206
Just drown then.
