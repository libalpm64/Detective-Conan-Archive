1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,330
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,130
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,730
The game is a killer!

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,730
It's time for another deduction show!

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,330
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,230
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,530
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
We were at a game arcade getting our photo stickers made,

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,840
that's when we run into Jody Santemillion,

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,940
an English teacher at Teitan High School

11
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,440
deeply engrossed in a shooting game.

12
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,740
At her insistence, Ran is set to compete in a fighting game

13
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,540
against a skilled gamer named Kengo Bito who beats her in no time at all.

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,840
But during the game with his next opponent,

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,540
Mr. Bito ends up getting killed!

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,040
There are four suspects.

17
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,340
Mr. Bito's opponent, Takayasu Shimizu,

18
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,040
the game arcade attendant, Hitoshi Dejima,

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,840
taxi driver, Toshitsugu Emori,

20
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
and Miss Jody.

21
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,140
Judging from the condition of the body,

22
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,740
I'm positive he was poisoned.

23
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,840
Which means, that person is the most suspicious

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,740
and the evidence is probably in there.

25
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,840
All that leaves are the needle or hypodermic syringe,

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,340
nothing like that was on the floor.

27
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,540
I doubt the killer would still be holding on to it.

28
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,440
The killer...

29
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Where did the killer hide the weapon?

30
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,640
"Battle Game Trap (Part 2)"

31
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,090
I was picking up a 100 yen coin.

32
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,390
"Toshitsugu Emori (41)" -I want to get some coffee from the vending machine,

33
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,590
"Taxi Driver" -but I dropped the coins on the floor.

34
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,590
Sure, he was a creep

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,790
but I respected his skills as a gamer.

36
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,790
Sure you did.

37
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,590
He saw you make a mistake when you played that racing game

38
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,990
and he treat you like a fool in front of everybody.

39
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,790
Is that true?

40
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,990
"Takayasu Shimizu (30), Game Magazine Writer" -It sure is! He yelled out,

41
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,090
"You'd better not get in this guy's taxi unless you want to die!"

42
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,990
Well, you had a stronger motive to kill him!

43
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,390
After all, that guy was your precious sister's boyfriend.

44
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,390
His sister's boyfriend?

45
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,890
They were living together,

46
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,290
or you could say he was living off of her,

47
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,190
After all, as her brother, he is also a gamer, just like that guy.

48
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,290
I guess he can't complain about anything either.

49
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,690
And what about you?

50
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,090
You wanted him out of the way too, didn't you?

51
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,990
What do you mean?

52
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,690
"Hitoshi Dejima (22)" -Up until six months ago,

53
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,690
"Store Worker" -he had a pretty good reputation as a gamer

54
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,690
and known as "The Battler of Beika".

55
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,090
That was until that guy came along and thrashed him,

56
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,690
then he dropped out of sight.

57
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,990
Who would've thought he'd change his hairstyle

58
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,290
and start working part time in a game arcade?

59
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,690
Inspector! They found poison in the victim's blood!

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,790
What?

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,190
The name of the poison is tetrodotoxin!

62
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,590
The point of entry was the inside of his upper right arm

63
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,890
and it appears the penetration went up to the artery.

64
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,290
Tetrodotoxin? that's...

65
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,790
Puffer fish poison!

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,790
Tetrodotoxin, commonly called TTX.

67
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,590
0.5-1 mg would cause instant death,

68
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,090
that's 1/500th the amount needed for a deadly dose of potassium cyanide,

69
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,190
it's a crazy poison.

70
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,690
It is found in most puffer fish.

71
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,090
But when ingested by mouth, the symptoms progress slowly

72
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,490
and the rate of survival is quite high.

73
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,990
When directly introduced into the bloodstream,

74
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,390
paralysis sets in quickly and it's "The End"?

75
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,790
Miss Jody?

76
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,790
"Jody Santemillion (28)" -My friend, who's a doctor told me.

77
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,790
"English Teacher" -When I was coming to Japan,

78
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,290
"English Teacher" -I was warned about eating puffer fish!

79
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,790
I knew it. Now to find where the weapon is hidden.

80
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,990
At any rate, let's go back to the scene of the crime

81
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,990
and go over everything one more time!

82
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,390
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,590
I hope you will all cooperate!

84
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,290
Sure...

85
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,990
There it is again. It's that sound.

86
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,690
What could it be?

87
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,590
Hey, the shoe lace on your left shoe is coming loose.

88
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,390
Thanks, kid.

89
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,290
It's dangerous, you could've tripped.

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,490
It was that person, that person killed Mr. Bito.

91
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,590
The distinct features of these arcades

92
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,190
were used to commit the murder.

93
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,090
But one thing bothers me.

94
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,990
Why'd that person deliberately do that in front of the police?

95
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,390
Conan!

96
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,790
What's the matter, Conan?

97
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,590
Come on, hurry!

98
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,690
Inspector! We've searched this floor from top to bottom

99
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,790
but we haven't come up with anything needle-like

100
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,690
that could've been the weapon.

101
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,090
According to the film in the security camera,

102
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:06,090
none of the suspects left this floor until the police arrived.

103
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,090
Chances are high the killer still has the weapon, don't you think?

104
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,990
Yes.

105
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,690
We'll be taking you all into another room for a body check.

106
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,090
I'll answer all of your questions or anything you want,

107
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,790
but don't you think you're making a mistake by suspecting me?

108
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,990
He died while playing against me,

109
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,790
I didn't have a chance to poison him.

110
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,190
Well, that goes for me too.

111
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,690
I was close to Mr. Bito just to collect the coins in the machine

112
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,390
before the game started, that's all.

113
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,390
If you going to do a body check,

114
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,990
you should check Mr. Emori who was close to the machine

115
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,090
when he was picking up the coin he dropped during the game.

116
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,790
And the lady was next to Mr. Bito playing her racing game.

117
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,790
Hey, wait a minute! What are you talking about?

118
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,090
Miss Jody was playing the game the whole time,

119
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,390
she couldn't have stopped! Right?

120
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,090
Right! No mistake about it!

121
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,690
Besides, the inspection of the scene just now proved, didn't it?

122
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,690
If you're sitting here...

123
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,390
See? Your hands don't reach the chair next to you.

124
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,690
I don't think she could have done it.

125
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,290
Let me say something now.

126
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,390
The poison was injected under Bito's right arm, wasn't it?

127
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,390
I came up from his left side, I couldn't have done it.

128
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,590
Everybody just calm down.

129
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,290
This is just a formality, so please cooperate.

130
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,490
Sonoko, what's wrong?

131
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,490
Good grief, how disappointing.

132
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,890
Inspector Megure, what's up with you?

133
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,290
What?

134
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,090
The killer's smiling right in front of you,

135
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,090
and you haven't caught on yet.

136
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,490
What?

137
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,090
The poison's point of entry was the inside of his upper right arm.

138
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,390
As Mr. Emori himself pointed out,

139
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,590
he couldn't have done it because the only time he was close to the victim,

140
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,990
he was on the left.

141
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,590
We can also cross Mr. Dejima out

142
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,990
since he came in contact with the victim before the game started

143
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,790
and after that, the victim was seen talking to Mr. Shimizu.

144
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,390
And of course, Miss Jody was busy playing her game

145
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,990
and we were on the opposite side of the victim

146
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,490
so none of us could have done it either.

147
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,590
Then that only leaves...

148
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,590
That's right. Only one person remains.

149
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,090
You're the only one who could've done it!

150
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,890
That's right. Only one person remains.

151
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,890
You're the only one who could've done it!

152
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,290
Takayasu Shimizu.

153
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,790
You're the only one!

154
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,490
Young lady, do you know what you're saying?

155
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,190
You watched the video, didn't you?

156
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,790
You saw me getting beaten in the game!

157
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,590
How could I have poisoned him in the midst of all that?

158
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,190
It's no use to acting innocent.

159
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,990
You'll see how easy it is when we demonstrate!

160
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,190
What?

161
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,690
Ran and Detective Takagi!

162
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,190
Excuse me, but will you play that game?

163
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,490
What? -The answer will come to you right away when you do it.

164
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,890
Please.

165
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,390
Hey...

166
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,790
Are you going to allow this?

167
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,990
To let the police take orders from a young girl.

168
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,790
Well, you may not know it but Sonoko's pretty sharp.

169
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,290
It's starting!

170
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,590
Fight!

171
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,890
What? -That girl is getting a total beating!

172
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,590
That police is real mean.

173
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,190
Hey, Takagi, go easy on her.

174
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,190
Hey!

175
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,090
K.O!

176
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,390
The girl's had it.

177
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,990
Poor thing.

178
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,590
Ta... Takagi! I know how much you hate to lose

179
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,090
but don't you think you went overboard here just a little too much?

180
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,790
Sonoko told me to tell Detective Takagi what to do.

181
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,490
She said he would be the girl character

182
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,190
and that he had to blindfold himself with his necktie

183
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,090
and not do anything during the game, just go limp!

184
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,490
Then the one controlling the male character was...

185
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,490
It was me! Sonoko told me to do this.

186
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,090
Isn't that right, Conan?

187
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,490
Yes!

188
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,490
Do you mean...

189
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,890
That's right. Preconceived notion.

190
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,690
Everyone would assume Ran would be the female character

191
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,490
and Detective Takagi would be the male character, correct?

192
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,290
But it was actually the opposite

193
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,490
just like it was before.

194
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,790
Mr. Bito is "The Shisa of Beika"

195
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,290
and Mr. Shimizu is "Lutus from Haido".

196
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,890
Everyone assumed they'd use their own characters.

197
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,190
And on top of that, this game has no hit point gauge

198
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,990
so no one can tell who is which character just by watching the monitor.

199
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,190
Nobody would notice if they switched!

200
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,190
Are you saying Mr. Bito was killed before the game started?

201
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,790
Yes, Mr. Shimizu had already injected him and he was either dead

202
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,590
or the poison was just starting to take effect and he was semi-conscious.

203
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,790
Tetrodotoxin causes paralysis.

204
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,590
Even if Mr. Bito was alive during the game,

205
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,390
it would have been difficult for him to sit straight up.

206
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,390
But if that were the case,

207
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,490
someone was bound to notice something was wrong.

208
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,290
No, that's not necessarily true!

209
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,890
I let my body go limp,

210
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,590
but every time I took a hit, my arms and legs would move a little bit.

211
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,590
Unless someone was watching very closely,

212
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,790
it would look like I was playing the game!

213
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,390
And besides, these guards would keep his body propped up

214
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,390
so he wouldn't fall.

215
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,190
This is how Mr. Shimizu did it!

216
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,690
Before the game starts,

217
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,690
he goes up to Mr. Bito

218
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,190
and injects him with the poison.

219
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,190
While Mr. Bito is struggling,

220
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,190
he finishes the game he's in the midst of

221
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,190
and then starts the new game with the new character,

222
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,490
his character, Lutus!

223
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,390
Then all he has to do is go to another machine

224
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,690
and enter the game as Mr. Bito's character, Shisa and he's set!

225
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,290
Then you deliver a series of blows to an unmoving opponent

226
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,590
and everyone thinks you're getting beat up.

227
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,990
But why didn't he deliver the finishing blow at the end of the game?

228
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,190
Because if he had and someone ran up to Mr. Bito,

229
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,290
they'd see the words "You Lose" on his machine when in fact he had won.

230
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,590
If they ended in a draw, "Draw" would appear on the screen!

231
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,890
And in a draw, the game comes to an immediate end!

232
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,890
The character Mr. Bito used would remain unknown.

233
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,990
What about the weapon?

234
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,490
If what you're saying is true, it should be around someplace.

235
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,390
Where's the needle or syringe?

236
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,790
That's why we're going to do a body check.

237
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,290
Search all you want.

238
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,890
But if you don't find it, you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

239
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,490
Of course we won't find it!

240
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,890
You don't have the weapon on you anymore,

241
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,890
but I bet you didn't notice.

242
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,590
A certain something has been following you around.

243
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,190
What do you mean?

244
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,390
Mr. Dejima, could you please come here?

245
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,390
Sure.

246
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,490
What is it?

247
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,290
That's fine, you can go back.

248
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,490
Well...

249
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,390
Okay.

250
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,590
What was that all about?

251
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,190
Didn't you notice it, Inspector?

252
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,090
Every time he takes a step,

253
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,290
you can hear a strange sound, like metal scratching something.

254
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,890
-What? -What?

255
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,290
Do you mean it's on the bottom of his shoe?

256
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,290
Yes, Mr. Shimizu...

257
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,890
he put the used needle inside a cigarette,

258
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,490
then stuck some gum to it

259
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,090
and then put it on top of the gum wrapping paper

260
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,890
and left it on the floor.

261
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,490
Someone would step on it while they were watching the game on the monitor

262
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,790
and then the evidence would be carried to another location.

263
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,790
And it was done when he bent down to pick up the lighter he dropped.

264
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,890
If the cigarette is flattened,

265
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,190
you wouldn't really notice when you stepped on it.

266
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,890
And even if you did notice,

267
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,690
you'd just think it was rubbish

268
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,490
and throw it in the trash bin.

269
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,090
I suppose we'll just have to rely on Mr. Shimizu's good conscience

270
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,490
as to whether he wiped the poison off the needle before he got rid of it.

271
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,690
He probably prepared the cigarette trick before the crime

272
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,390
in the toilet of this arcade.

273
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,890
All he had to do was roll up the paper

274
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,590
and put it into the box of cigarettes,

275
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,190
then when he took it out, it wouldn't look suspicious.

276
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,290
I see.

277
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,590
So if we find Mr. Shimizu's fingerprints on this cigarette or paper,

278
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,390
then we'll have the proof we need.

279
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,390
I must commend you that was one terrific story

280
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,790
but unfortunately, this is a trap, young lady.

281
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,990
What?

282
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,490
Take a look!

283
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,890
Both the gum and the cigarette aren't my brand.

284
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,190
It's true.

285
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,690
Sure. I'm sure somebody's trying to frame me!

286
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,690
It's a well-known fact that I chew on gum

287
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,990
during the game to keep rhythm, it was even written up in a magazine.

288
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,590
Check if you don't believe me,

289
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,990
you're not going to find my fingerprint on anything!

290
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,290
Now I understand. That's what bothered me all along.

291
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,290
What?

292
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,690
I couldn't understand

293
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,590
why you would chew gum in front of the police

294
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,190
when you used gum to hide the weapon!

295
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,390
I'll bet you used someone else's gum and cigarette

296
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,390
from the ashtrays in this arcade.

297
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,590
You chewed gum so that you could use that excuse

298
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,890
just in case the needle was found.

299
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,790
You used the preconceived notion that

300
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,390
no criminal would deliberately incriminate himself to your own advantage.

301
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,390
But wouldn't his fingerprints he left behind when he injected the victim?

302
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,090
No, if the needle was placed between his fingers,

303
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,490
it would be possible to commit the crime

304
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,090
and not leave any finger or palm print!

305
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,390
That's right!

306
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,890
If you push the top and bottom of the cigarette box,

307
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,590
you could take it out without leaving your fingerprint.

308
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,590
But what about the coins?

309
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,790
Mr. Dejima.

310
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,590
Could you please open up the coin box on that machine?

311
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,590
Sure.

312
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,890
There should be 2100 yen coins in there if his story is true.

313
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,090
Because before Mr. Bito started the game,

314
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,890
Mr. Dejima had collected the coins already.

315
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,290
But I'm sure you'll find three coins in there!

316
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,290
What?

317
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,190
She's right!

318
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,790
There's three coins in here!

319
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,940
You... You're right.

320
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
One of them is the coin Mr. Bito put in to start the game,

321
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,440
another will be Detective Takagi's, he just finished his game

322
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,140
and the last one is the coin the killer put in

323
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,440
when he started the "camouflage game"?

324
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
That's right. Mr. Shimizu,

325
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,740
your fingerprints should be all over that 100 yen coin.

326
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,540
But we won't know until we have it analysed.

327
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,840
Sure we do.

328
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,840
The coins were collected before Mr. Shimizu got here.

329
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
He probably thought it wouldn't pose a problem

330
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,640
if a coin with his fingerprint was found in a mountain of other coins.

331
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,540
Another thing, unless he wore gloves,

332
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,340
he wouldn't be able to drop the coin in without leaving his fingerprint.

333
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,740
You'll find them. My fingerprints are on it.

334
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,340
I had a tight grip on it when I dropped it in.

335
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,940
That's because I intended that to be my last game.

336
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,840
Your last game?

337
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,740
Yes, I intended to bid farewell to these games as well as to that guy.

338
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,240
It was for my sister's sake, she's in the hospital and almost blind.

339
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,740
Almost blind?

340
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,240
Do you know how she got that way?

341
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,740
Vitamin E deficiency due to malnutrition.

342
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,440
Can you imagine in this day and age?

343
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,240
In order to repay the gambling debts of that guy,

344
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,240
my sister was working like crazy this past month and hardly ate anything.

345
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,840
But after all he put her through,

346
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,040
she still refused to break up with him.

347
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,940
I don't know how you could have played games with someone like that.

348
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,340
He told me that

349
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:29,740
if I won just one game against him, he'd leave my sister alone.

350
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,740
I practiced and got good enough to be called "Lutus from Haido",

351
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,140
but I just couldn't beat him.

352
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,740
And so you killed him?

353
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,540
Yes, but you know, Inspector? I regret it now.

354
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,940
That unbeatable character he controlled, Shisa,

355
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,540
I destroyed my chance to beat it with my own hands.

356
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Sonoko, you were terrific, good job!

357
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,140
Sonoko, you were great!

358
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,340
You were just like Kate Martinelli!

359
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,540
Kate?

360
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,040
That famous female police officer in the America.

361
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,840
It's true, even Shinichi would've been impressed!

362
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,790
Shinichi?

363
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,090
The boy who appeared at the school fest!

364
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,790
He is so cool!

365
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,390
I wouldn't say that, all he thinks of solving crimes.

366
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,790
Well, Miss Jody, we go this way.

367
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,790
Goodbye, Miss Jody!

368
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,790
Bye bye, see you tomorrow at school!

369
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,390
Bye bye, cool guy.

370
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,490
Yes, that's right.

371
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,690
A lot happened.

372
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,790
You were right, I don't think I'll be bored.

373
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,090
I think I've got one of our targets.

374
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,290
Yes, he changed his appearance and going to school as if nothing happened.

375
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,990
Isn't that funny?

376
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,290
Little mister target.

377
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,390
That's right.

378
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,090
Rotten apple.

379
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,190
Shall I turn him into a rotten apple?

380
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's hint:

381
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,100
"Shelf"
