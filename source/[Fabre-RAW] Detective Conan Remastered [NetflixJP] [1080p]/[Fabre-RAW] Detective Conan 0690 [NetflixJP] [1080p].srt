1
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,729
"Ten years ago"

2
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,029
What?

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:15,995
You want out of the case?

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,529
Are you saying that you want out of this case?

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,329
Yes, well, I guess so.

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,129
Let's not depend on a novelist like him

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,005
and nab the culprit, just by the hands of we, the police,

8
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,429
Assistant Inspector Megure!

9
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:31,029
The press is making a great fuss, after all over the word

10
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,029
"Death" that was written with the blood of the corpse.

11
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:37,529
They're saying that it may be the start of a bizarre series of murders!

12
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:41,329
-Yeah... -No need for worry.

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:44,529
This is not a homicide.

14
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:47,629
But this word, "Death"...

15
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,629
I assure you.

16
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:55,029
Yusaku Kudo here will.

17
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,429
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

18
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,429
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,229
The cold case of that father in question.

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,229
What is the mystery behind the case ten years ago?

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,929
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,029
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,829
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:57,026
"Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 1)"

25
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:11,626
You mean Shinichi Kudo's father

26
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:15,026
is that famous mystery writer Yusaku Kudo?

27
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,226
Yep! It seems that he's away from Japan

28
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,526
and writing from somewhere abroad, though.

29
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,926
I used to read a lot of his novels when I was a child.

30
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:24,183
The Night Baron Series and the like.

31
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,426
Well, but, thanks to him,

32
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,326
that mystery loving freak son of his was born!

33
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:31,126
But, how comforting to know that

34
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,426
your future husband's father is a best seller novelist!

35
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,526
You're assured an easy life.

36
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:36,826
Future husband?

37
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:40,526
By the way, about what you were saying a while ago, is it true?

38
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,526
Is it true that you know about the bizarre case,

39
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,826
the only one that Yusaku Kudo ever gave up on?

40
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,526
Yes. Back when Shinichi's father was still in Japan,

41
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:52,626
he was cooperating on investigating the case.

42
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:55,126
But Shinichi was really angry that his father

43
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:57,526
had given up on that case half way through.

44
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:00,219
And, what kind of case was it?

45
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,426
Well...

46
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,223
If I remember correctly, some kind of word

47
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,626
was written near the corpse.

48
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:07,826
Hey! Are you all right?

49
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:10,626
Hey, get a hold of yourself, Takaichi!

50
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,231
Mr. Takaichi?

51
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,726
Hey, Takaichi!

52
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,235
What's the matter?

53
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,326
Well, you see.

54
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,926
We were looking for him because he didn't show up at work.

55
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,026
Then we found him slumped down in a place like this.

56
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:23,926
He's bleeding from his mouth besides.

57
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,926
We did call the ambulance to be safe.

58
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,926
There's no need to call the ambulance.

59
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,253
Almost about nine hours

60
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,826
seems to have passed since he died already.

61
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,826
What?

62
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:41,926
Does he have alcohol dependency?

63
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:43,926
Yeah. He used to say that

64
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,926
the doctor told him to stay away from alcoholic drinks.

65
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:48,267
But, how'd you know about it?

66
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:51,926
He's got jaundice on the white of his eye.

67
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,273
He's skinny but has a popped belly.

68
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,275
This is an abdominal build of fluids!

69
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,277
It's proof that he's got a malfunctioning liver!

70
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:02,026
Furthermore, there is a bottle of sake left behind untouched

71
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:05,026
in the dispenser of the vending machine.

72
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,285
From the circumstances,

73
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:11,126
it's very likely that it's the bottle of sake that he bought!

74
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:13,226
If he were a patient suffering from a bad liver,

75
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,826
he would most naturally stay away from alcohol

76
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,626
that would worsen his symptoms.

77
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,626
However, if he wanted alcohol despite his condition,

78
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:22,926
I just thought that he may have an alcohol dependency problem!

79
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:24,303
Wow.

80
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,426
So, well, an alcoholic

81
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,126
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver had a burst varix

82
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,626
and spit blood.

83
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:33,026
And since unfortunately, there was no one around at that time,

84
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:36,315
he couldn't get help and died.

85
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,026
That's what you'd normally think.

86
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:41,926
But, this is not death by illness.

87
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,323
It's a crime committed by someone with malicious intent!

88
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,325
What?

89
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,626
As proof of this, right in front of this man, see!

90
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:53,526
There is the word "Death" written with blood.

91
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:57,426
Hold it.

92
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:58,926
This word, "Death"!

93
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,326
Looks just like the word that was found back

94
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,526
at the scene of the crime ten years ago!

95
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:04,126
Don't tell me that!

96
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,626
It's the case that Shinichi's father gave up on

97
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,347
that was mentioned a while ago.

98
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:12,026
Yep! Back then, Shinichi showed me the picture of the crime scene,

99
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:13,926
so there's no mistake about it!

100
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:18,726
"Death"

101
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,426
Mail for Shinichi's cell phone?

102
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:41,326
It's from Ran.

103
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:45,326
I encountered a murder scene on my way to school today

104
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:47,826
and was surprised to find that the word written in blood

105
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,426
left behind at the scene

106
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:52,826
was exactly like the word you showed me ten years ago!

107
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,626
Sera and Sonoko say that they want to see that photo too

108
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:59,026
so we're going over to your house after school to look for it.

109
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,426
I hope you don't mind.

110
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,926
Besides, I have an idea of where it may be.

111
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,326
A word written in blood ten years ago.

112
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,407
Does she mean the case Dad ran out on?

113
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,126
I mean, wait a sec.

114
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:13,026
To look for it? Don't tell me that Sera and Sonoko

115
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,726
are coming over to my house too?

116
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,326
Hey? Where's Conan?

117
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:21,026
Come to think of it, he's not around.

118
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,726
How dare he slack off?

119
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:27,226
He said he had something urgent to do, so he had to leave early.

120
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:29,626
He said he'd make up for this one day.

121
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:30,826
Make up for it?

122
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,426
If he's making anything, I'd like eels over rice then!

123
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:36,726
He's making up for it.

124
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,441
Oh! It's a response from Shinichi.

125
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,443
I really don't feel comfortable

126
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:47,026
having people searching the house on their own,

127
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,426
so I told Conan where the picture is

128
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,126
and had him go to get it.

129
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:54,026
So, please settle for him taking it to the detective agency

130
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:56,226
and showing it to you there, okay?

131
00:07:57,426 --> 00:08:00,459
Then, why don't you tell me where it is?

132
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,426
I get it!

133
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:05,526
Maybe he's got some lewd books near the picture, or something?

134
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,826
What?

135
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:09,626
But we already got here!

136
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,626
This is it, right? Shinichi Kudo's house.

137
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,473
Yep.

138
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,826
Why don't we go inside while we're at it?

139
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:27,426
I'd like to meet Subaru, the guy who I heard lives here too!

140
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:30,026
Hello!

141
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,491
Conan's shoes.

142
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,493
You mean he's already here!

143
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,926
That brat sure is fast.

144
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,126
But, there's something about Subaru's

145
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,026
that's been bothering me from before!

146
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,826
Huh? What? What about?

147
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,226
Because you see,

148
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:48,507
he always wears clothes that hides his neck, doesn't he?

149
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,509
Huh? Is that so?

150
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,513
Yep, that's why maybe he's got an embarrassing tattoo

151
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:57,126
or something on his neck that he wants to hide!

152
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,426
Now that you mentioned it...

153
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:02,521
So, I was thinking of pulling off his top

154
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,426
when I have the chance someday, what do you say?

155
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:06,525
What do I say?

156
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:11,826
Isn't it just that you want to see Subaru naked, Sonoko?

157
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,026
Well, that too.

158
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,226
Conan.

159
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:19,026
So, that' s where you are!

160
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:34,553
Oh, Subaru!

161
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:38,557
I think Conan is here.

162
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:44,326
Oh, you mean he's in the study?

163
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:48,226
Okay, we'll go over there then!

164
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:49,726
Sonoko!

165
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:55,126
He doesn't have a tattoo on his neck.

166
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,326
Let's go, Sera!

167
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:01,126
Yeah. Okay.

168
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,552
Hey, Conan!

169
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,607
Do you want me to help you look for it?

170
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,652
I'm fine! I'm just about to find it already.

171
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,052
Why don't you drink black tea or something in the kitchen?

172
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,952
I'll take it to you when I find it!

173
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,152
Oh, okay.

174
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,619
I'll be waiting for you then! Let's go!

175
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,252
Yeah. See you later then, Conan!

176
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,252
Yep.

177
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:52,152
I tell you. After I mailed her telling her not to come.

178
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,152
Maybe Shinichi's hiding something after all.

179
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:57,952
Hiding what?

180
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,352
Lewd books.

181
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,052
No way.

182
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,252
Because although he let you clean the place

183
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:05,752
every month on your own,

184
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,552
isn't it strange that he doesn't want you

185
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:09,952
-to look for that certain picture? -But...

186
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,652
No, he may be hiding a woman.

187
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,252
A woman?

188
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,655
Take a look at this.

189
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
A hair clip band.

190
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:22,052
It was on this shelf.

191
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,952
Women have a tendency to put things like these

192
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,852
in places like this.

193
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:30,669
Oh, it's probably Shinichi's mother's! Right?

194
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:33,952
Come to think of it, she usually used to tie her hair back.

195
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:36,675
But, among the dishes that aren't washed yet,

196
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:37,852
there is a glass cup where lipstick

197
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:41,652
seems to have been wiped off with the thumb.

198
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:46,052
And in the drain of the sink, there is a long strand of hair.

199
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,689
It looks to be hair from a wig, though.

200
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,691
Don't tell me that Shinichi's

201
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,152
flirting with some woman or something?

202
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:56,695
If you think so,

203
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,352
why don't you take a picture of this and save it,

204
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,452
and keep it in your diary!

205
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,352
If you write in when and where you found this evidence,

206
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:06,452
and how you felt at that time,

207
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,252
it would come in handy when you go to court.

208
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,152
Court?

209
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,652
Use a disposable instant camera rather than a digital camera

210
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,552
where the pictures can be processed in any way!

211
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:19,052
For the diary, use a ball point pen that cannot easily be revised,

212
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,652
and write in the news or weather of that day

213
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,552
to increase reliability!

214
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,752
The weather and news?

215
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:28,252
And you're saying that she'd be able to get

216
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,152
that smooth talking mystery freak by doing so, master?

217
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,952
Well, sort of. I guess.

218
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,452
Mr. Kudo hasn't been here for a while, has he?

219
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:37,952
Most naturally speaking,

220
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:42,352
wouldn't that guy called Subaru that we saw awhile ago, his lady?

221
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:44,452
I guess so.

222
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:49,052
I brought you the picture. What're you talking about?

223
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:52,752
Never mind. You don't need to know about this, Conan!

224
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,753
It's adult talk.

225
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,952
Really, it sure looks alike!

226
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,852
This word "Death" written in blood.

227
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,152
Then, don't tell me that

228
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,752
the murderer from ten years ago appeared again?

229
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:10,752
The serial killer?

230
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,352
Yeah. I checked on the internet and found that

231
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:17,052
the word written in blood ten years ago wasn't publicized.

232
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,777
So I guess there's no mistake deeming that

233
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:21,652
the same culprit committed the crime!

234
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,452
It's true that they both look alike, but...

235
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:27,152
Dad, back ten years ago...

236
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:30,552
I assure you.

237
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:34,352
Yusaku Kudo here will.

238
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:37,852
I'll assure you that this culprit who wrote and left behind

239
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:40,352
this word "Death",

240
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,752
will never ever appear again.

241
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,811
What's going on?

242
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,452
I thought you said the culprit would never ever appear again?

243
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,752
Dad?

244
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:05,652
What? Really?

245
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,827
Did that Yusaku Kudo really say so?

246
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,152
Yep!

247
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,452
He said that the culprit who wrote the word "Death"

248
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,752
that was found near the corpse would never ever appear again.

249
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:20,552
Shinichi said that he heard so from his father ten years ago!

250
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:23,252
I remember that Shinichi told me so

251
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,752
when he showed me the picture too!

252
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:29,752
Moreover, although there was blood on the man's palms and fingers,

253
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:32,252
there was none on his fingertips,

254
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:35,252
so Shinichi was unconvinced, insisting that the dead man

255
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:37,152
couldn't have written the words on his own,

256
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:40,552
and yet, why wasn't this deemed to be a homicide case.

257
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:46,852
Even if it wasn't murder, there's no mistake that

258
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:50,252
someone was near the corpse before the blood dried up.

259
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:53,152
Besides, this morning we encountered a crime scene

260
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:58,877
where a word written in blood exactly like this one was found.

261
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,652
But, if I remember correctly, that case

262
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:03,352
that happened ten years ago, wasn't it deemed as an accident?

263
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,152
Yep, that's right.

264
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:06,352
Death by accident?

265
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,352
The details seem to be written on this paper

266
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:11,452
that was inside together with this picture.

267
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,893
Let's see.

268
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,152
The person who died was Mr. Takefumi Koriyama,

269
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:19,552
the principal of a nursery school,

270
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,901
and the cause of his death was shock from damage to his heart.

271
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:24,452
A shattered piece of glass from the fishbowl

272
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:27,452
that poked into his chest area pierced through his heart

273
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,907
and lead to his death.

274
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,352
He was scheduled to move the fish into

275
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:34,452
a fishbowl temporarily in order to clean the fish tank but,

276
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,915
he forgot the fishbowl at his residence

277
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,152
so went back to get it, and on his way back to the nursery,

278
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:43,652
he used a shortcut going through the park.

279
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,252
However, he unfortunately tripped over a stone on the cobbled road,

280
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:50,552
and fell, still holding the fishbowl in his hand and passed away.

281
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,452
The one who first found the dead body

282
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,452
was a student at that nursery,

283
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,935
Ryosuke Nishimura, five years old.

284
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,652
The only son of a monk of a temple nearby.

285
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:01,252
When the nursery school employees

286
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,552
were making a fuss over the principal not coming back,

287
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:06,552
they hear from this boy that he saw the principal

288
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:09,452
lying on the ground on his way to the nursery.

289
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:10,949
So, they run over to the park

290
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,352
and found the principal's body there.

291
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:18,152
The boy back then was jittery and reticent

292
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,959
but as soon as he began eating the candy that he had,

293
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,352
he finally started talking.

294
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:24,963
He talked about the fact that

295
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,552
he was taking care of a puppy in the park

296
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,752
along with the other students,

297
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:30,969
and that he checked on the dog on his way to the nursery.

298
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:32,971
He went on to explain that he called out to the principal

299
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:36,352
but he didn't answer, so the boy thought that he was dead,

300
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,652
gathered some flowers from the park

301
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:38,977
and placed it by him as an offering.

302
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,552
Oh, really,

303
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,452
there are flowers in the picture.

304
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,452
Above the word written in blood.

305
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,987
But, it looks more scattered, than like an offering, doesn't it?

306
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,752
I'm sure the culprit who wrote this word scattered them around!

307
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:56,652
But, if that principal was murdered by someone,

308
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,452
the culprit would've had to push the principal

309
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,952
who was holding the fishbowl from behind, give him a fatal blow

310
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:03,352
and write the word using the blood

311
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:06,452
that was bleeding from the principal...

312
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,007
but this boy who offered the flowers seems to have said that

313
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,252
there was no such word written in blood back then.

314
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:17,015
If so, right after the culprit attacked and killed the principal,

315
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,017
he hid for a while without even attempting to flee,

316
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,019
despite the boy having come along.

317
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,752
Then, waited for the boy to leave

318
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,552
and approached the corpse once more,

319
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:29,027
leaving the word written in blood behind.

320
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:33,452
Maybe it's that boy?

321
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,452
The one who wrote the word using the blood?

322
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:36,452
What?

323
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:39,052
I'm sure that he wrote it when he offered the flowers!

324
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,652
See, because he was the son of a monk,

325
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:42,752
maybe he did it to put the dead to rest.

326
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,752
But, he was only a boy of five years old, you know.

327
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:47,352
I don't think he knew how to write the kanji character "Death".

328
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,652
But this brat who is just about the same age

329
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,452
seems to be able to write it though.

330
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,052
How was the man

331
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:57,055
who died that you and everyone else saw this morning?

332
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:58,752
Huh?

333
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,152
It could serve as a hint to nab the culprit

334
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,052
if you can find some similarities

335
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:04,852
with the case that occurred ten years ago.

336
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,852
Similarities...

337
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,552
Nothing else except for that word written in blood.

338
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:11,069
The thing that was found near the corpse

339
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,752
was not flowers but a cigarette.

340
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:17,952
I see! The thing that was in that picture was a cigarette.

341
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,077
Yep.

342
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,079
It was smeared with blood though.

343
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,452
The estimated time of death of that man

344
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,652
was around 23:00 last night.

345
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,452
The corpse was leaning against the sake vending machine,

346
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:31,089
and in the dispenser of the machine,

347
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:34,052
a new bottle of sake was still inside.

348
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:38,452
Something happened to that man right after he bought the sake,

349
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,852
and I think he was left there until daybreak.

350
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:45,952
You can only buy sake using a vending machine till 23:00, see!

351
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:48,652
But, the word "Death" that was found near the man

352
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:51,109
was also written in blood, right?

353
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:55,113
Was that man poked by something too?

354
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,115
He was bleeding from his mouth!

355
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,452
That man seems to have had an alcohol dependency problem, you see.

356
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:05,123
So, I first thought that he died of bleeding from a burst varix.

357
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,125
That is, until I saw the word written in blood

358
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,352
from the opposite side of the corpse!

359
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,452
In other words, the points in common of these two cases

360
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,652
are that the font of the word "Death" are almost exactly alike

361
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:25,143
and the other that both corpses do not look to have been murdered?

362
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,452
Yes...

363
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,147
And...

364
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:33,151
According to the newspaper clipping that was inside the envelope,

365
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,153
it's written that the nursery employee who rushed over to the park

366
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,952
found the word "Death" only after

367
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:40,852
he tried to lift the body and move it.

368
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,161
This picture is probably one that was taken

369
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,152
after the corpse was moved a bit,

370
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:48,552
and when that boy found the corpse, the word written in blood

371
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:50,352
was already there

372
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:54,352
but was hidden out of sight by the body.

373
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:56,252
Oh, I'm sorry...

374
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:57,852
for butting in on you.

375
00:19:57,852 --> 00:20:03,552
Subaru is a Holmes fan and loves to make deductions!

376
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,152
Come to think of it, this morning, we saw the colleague

377
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:11,189
shaking the body of the man who died, right?

378
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,952
Yep. Maybe that corpse was moved a bit too.

379
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:18,752
If so, why not ask the police about it?

380
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:21,552
Officer Takagi was the one who came

381
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,752
when you called the police, right, Ran?

382
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:26,452
Maybe he'll tell you something.

383
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:29,207
Oh, you mean the corpse that was found this morning?

384
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:32,452
I'm sure it was a man called Mr. Isao Takaichi

385
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:34,052
that lives near the site.

386
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:37,852
I don't know what happened to the corpse after that though.

387
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,852
It was concluded to be a robbery case,

388
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:42,452
and was passed over to the investigation 3rd division.

389
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:46,652
Robbery? It wasn't a homicide?

390
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:51,229
Hey, cut out the joke! What about that case is a robbery?

391
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,152
You are...

392
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,952
I'm Sera, the one who was with Ran at the scene of the crime!

393
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,252
Oh.

394
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:00,652
That high school girl detective.

395
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:03,241
You saw too, didn't you? That word "Death" written in blood?

396
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,852
Well, I thought the same thing too.

397
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:08,652
That this was a bizarre homicide case.

398
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:11,252
But, Inspector Megure who came along

399
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:13,652
after you all left for school,

400
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,253
saw that word written in blood

401
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:18,152
and immediately said, 'this is probably a robbery'.

402
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,752
In fact, no wallet was found on the corpse.

403
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:23,852
But, he did buy the beer, didn't he?

404
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:25,263
If he lived close by,

405
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:28,052
he could've just had enough money on him to buy the beer!

406
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:31,652
Yeah. I thought so too, but...

407
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:35,273
Oh, by the way, just like you had said,

408
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,352
he seems to have died of a burst varix due to cirrhosis.

409
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:40,852
Hey, Officer Takagi! Let's go get info!

410
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,052
Oh, yes, sir!

411
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,152
So, I've got to go, sorry.

412
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:46,552
Oh, hey?

413
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:48,752
I'm not finished yet!

414
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:49,752
Hey!

415
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:53,952
Darn.

416
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:59,297
It's not a homicide but a robbery.

417
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:24,252
It's strange, isn't it?

418
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:25,952
I'm sure that Inspector Megure

419
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,452
was also in charge of the case that occurred ten years ago.

420
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:29,952
It's only natural that he would consider it

421
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,952
to be a case of serial murder, and yet...

422
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,391
That's true.

423
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:37,395
Ten years ago, Inspector Megure is sure to have seen

424
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,397
that word written in blood too.

425
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,152
And yet... why?

426
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:45,403
Besides, back then, Dad was talking with the boy

427
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,152
who first found the corpse.

428
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:48,752
Moreover, he was smiling too.

429
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:52,352
I wonder why.

430
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:56,252
I wonder why Dad declared that it was not homicide.

431
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:58,752
Why?

432
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,100
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,032
"Loose Change"

434
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,232
Are you more concerned about him flirting than the case itself?

435
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:09,812
In order to win the case.

436
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:56,240
Hey, hey!
