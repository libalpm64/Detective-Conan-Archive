1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,260
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,160
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,860
The stage for today's case is the Loop Line.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,860
There is no end of the line for either the train or the case.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,460
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,560
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,760
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,300
"The Loop Line of Silence"

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
"Second Street Station"

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,600
We missed the train didn't we?

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,700
Hey.

12
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Wait. For goodness sake...

13
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,400
Good grief.

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,100
This old man has some serious issues.

15
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,300
We just finished a job,

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,000
at least let me have a beer.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Oh big deal.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,700
The job was delivering some papers the client forgot, that's all.

19
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,400
On top of that, since its Sunday, no one was in the office.

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,800
That hits the spot, delicious!

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
The train sure is empty, isn't it, Conan?

22
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,000
Probably because it's a Sunday night.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,700
This is the business district.

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,300
I am sure it's usually busy on workdays.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,700
Today sure wear me out.

26
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,500
Sorry, it's all my fault.

27
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,600
You really are a klutz.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Kiyomi who started a year before you was a fast learner.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
"Seiji Kurata" -By the way, Kiyomi sure rushed home,

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
I wonder what she had to do,

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
"Shizuka Kawai" -She probably had a date.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
After all, Sunday's a day off.

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
And if it weren't for someone I know,

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
we wouldn't have had to work today either.

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,900
"Yukiko Mori" -I am really sorry.

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,200
I promise to make it up to you soon.

37
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,400
That's what you always say.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,700
Enough, don't be so hard on her.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Yukiko didn't do it on purpose.

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,000
There you go again, spoiling the newcomer.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,700
That's why I always look like the mean one.

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,200
You know that's not true.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,700
Okay... calm down you two.

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
The train will be pulling into track 2 momentarily,

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,500
-please wait behind the yellow line. -I am going to go buy some juice.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,100
Come back, the train is coming.

47
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,600
Don't worry. Get on without me.

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,100
Good grief.

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
Conan, come on, hurry.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Alright.

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,400
I wonder if Yukiko got on okay.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,100
That girls so irresponsible sometimes.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,500
-Let's go take a look. -Okay.

54
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
Pretend we don't know him.

55
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,000
What're you doing, Yukiko?

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,400
Seiji, I made it just in time.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
I spilled some.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Clumsy.

59
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,800
-You know, Yukiko... -Isn't that... Kiyomi?

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,900
It is.

61
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,900
She left hours ago, what's she doing here?

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,900
She's fast asleep.

63
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,700
You mean she's been sitting here

64
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
and rode the train for a whole lap?

65
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,300
She must've been exhausted.

66
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,700
Kiyomi, wake up.

67
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,100
Kiyomi.

68
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Hey!

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,300
What was that?

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,100
Excuse me.

71
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,400
There's no pulse, she's dead.

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,300
Excuse me, are you her friends?

73
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,700
Yes, we're...

74
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,000
Who are you?

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,900
Who, me?

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
I am Kogoro Mouri, private investigator.

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,100
You mean Kogoro Mouri... the famous...

78
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,600
That's right in the flesh.

79
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,500
It looks like southing pricked her ear lobe.

80
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,400
And her ear's a little black,

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,800
like its been pressed back.

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Excuse me, sir, her ears...

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
You keep quiet!

84
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,000
The color of the ears...

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,500
It looks like a reaction to poison.

86
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,100
This may be a murder.

87
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,500
Murder?

88
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,100
Ran, get the conductor

89
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,500
and call the police too.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Okay.

91
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,800
What is this mark?

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Everyone please stand back.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,200
I don't want anyone in here until the police arrive.

94
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,900
That means you kids too...

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Kiyomi.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,900
Please don't touch the body.

97
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
I am sorry.

98
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,400
Inspector Megure.

99
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,200
I took down the names and addresses of all the passengers we let off.

100
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,100
The estimated tine of death is approximately 6:30 pm.

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,500
Yes, I see.

102
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,800
The body was discovered past 7:30 pm.

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,900
It takes 1 hour and 10 minutes

104
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,300
for this loop line to complete one lap so.

105
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,800
So I guess there's no mistake, she died in the train.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,100
Which means the victim died shortly after boarding the train.

107
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,000
The train completed one lap and came back to this station.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,700
What is the cause of death?

109
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,500
It appears she was pricked on the earlobe

110
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,400
with a pin-like object coated with a fast acting poison.

111
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,300
There are no other wounds or signs of a struggle.

112
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,000
This is the victims shoulder bag.

113
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
What are you doing?

114
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,200
Sorry.

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,500
Sir, wasn't that left open?

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,200
Just be quiet.

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,700
Just a second.

118
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,200
What you're saying is,

119
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,600
there's a possibility the killer took something out of victims bag.

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,700
Inspector, her wallets here.

121
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,200
Nothing seems to have been taken out.

122
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,600
We will let her three friends confirm the contents.

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,700
They may notice something.

124
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Yes.

125
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,400
Officer Takagi.

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
There's more over there.

127
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
You're right.

128
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,700
Thanks, Conan.

129
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,400
I like you to confirm these items.

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,300
Where's your other friend?

131
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,200
It seen the shock of it is hitting her only now.

132
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,500
I don't blame her.

133
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,300
I will let you two take care of the identification here.

134
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,200
Conan don't.

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Come on, let's wait over there.

136
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,600
-But, I... -Enough.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
How are you feeling?

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,500
Fine, thank you.

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,400
I don't remember what Kiyomi always carried with her.

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,100
But Seiji might know.

141
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,700
He'd been asking her for a date for the longest time

142
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,100
and he gave her a lot of presents.

143
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,500
Presents?

144
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Were you dating the victim?

145
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
No. She kept turning me down.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,100
I see.

147
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,300
That means you had a good motives, revenge.

148
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,000
I'd never.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Shizuka. How could you say such a thing.

150
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Now...

151
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,300
Usually we get along very well.

152
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,400
But because of what happened today...

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,100
So, after work, you all went for dinner

154
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,300
but Miss Hashimoto alone left for home?

155
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
Yes, that's right.

156
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,200
Do you usually work on Sundays?

157
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Our job is advertising design,

158
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,900
but I made a mistake yesterday

159
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,200
and we had to give up our Sunday to finish up.

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,600
When is the last time you saw her?

161
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,100
It was at the Second Street Station.

162
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,000
We all walked her to the station.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,300
How did she seem at that time?

164
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
We parted at the ticket gate

165
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,000
but she was her usual self.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
And that was around 6:30 pm?

167
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
The three of you were together

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,900
until discovering the body, correct?

169
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
-Yes. -Yes...

170
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,500
Did Kiyomi have any enemies?

171
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Seiji, you just told us she kept turning you down

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,300
you are the most likely.

173
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,500
You, you've got to be kidding.

174
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm not the only one.

175
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,900
Yukiko, you hated her for stealing your boyfriend, didn't you?

176
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
No, I didn't.

177
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,700
And Shizuka, didn't you tell me she stole your design?

178
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,300
What're you trying to say?

179
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,100
-I see, so all of you had motives. -Don't be hasty, Mouri.

180
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,500
The estimated time of her death is somewhere around 6:30 pm.

181
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,100
That's about the time we left her at the station.

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Yes, right after you left.

183
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Were you three really together the whole time?

184
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,500
Yes, we had dinner together.

185
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,100
It's a place we always go to

186
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,900
so you can verify it if you want.

187
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,000
Since they all have alibis,

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,500
I am sure we can exclude then from our list of suspects.

189
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,700
I am pretty sure it was a random killing by a crazed person.

190
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,900
We have the names and addresses of the passengers we let off,

191
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,700
I just hope the killers among them.

192
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,400
However, since her bag was found open,

193
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,100
I'd like to check through your possessions too.

194
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Why did the killer kill her in the train?

195
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,900
And why stab her in the ears of all.

196
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,800
And her ears were laid flat as if they had been pressed.

197
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,000
It's too strange to be a random killing.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So, you're saying you know no reason for anyone hating her.

199
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,600
An MD player and a headphone with a bent arm.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,300
Every disc has a label on it.

201
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,300
Index labels for the MD.

202
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
What's this?

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
Strange.

204
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,700
None of them have a front label.

205
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
This color...

206
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes, that's it.

207
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,000
Something was bothering me,

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,300
now I know what it was.

209
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,400
Yes, it would be possible to kill Kiyomi

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,800
and have an alibi if one were to use that method.

211
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,000
There's no mistake that person is the killer.

212
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,990
If any deduction is correct,

213
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,990
that person is the killer,

214
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,090
but I don't have enough proof.

215
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,390
Aren't you through searching our things yet?

216
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,790
I'm sure they're almost done.

217
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,990
He have no reason to steal something out of Kiyoumi's bag.

218
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,090
You people have a lot of nerve.

219
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,090
That's enough, Shizuka.

220
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,990
They're just doing their job

221
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,690
What's that...

222
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,290
What're you doing?

223
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,590
I am sorry.

224
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,990
Conan, look what you did!

225
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,890
I am sorry, Seiji.

226
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,990
I am really very sorry.

227
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,490
No problem, forget it.

228
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,190
I perspire a lot

229
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,590
so I always carry an extra shirt.

230
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,090
Inspector, would it be alright if I got a shirt from my things?

231
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,290
I guess it's okay.

232
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,990
Hey! Takagi!

233
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,190
That was very naughty, you have to behave.

234
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,790
I am going to apologize to him.

235
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,090
Excuse me, Kiyomi and the three of you were good friends, weren't you?

236
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,290
Sure, I got a little excited back there

237
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,290
and made it sound like we all hated her

238
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,090
but we weren't really on bad terms,

239
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,990
we were all good friends.

240
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,690
Of course you were.

241
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,290
Take today for example,

242
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,790
Yukiko dropped Kiyomi's MD player and it broke.

243
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,490
But Kiyomi didn't even get mad.

244
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,090
She forgave Yukiko.

245
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,990
Kiyomi and Yukiko were especially close,

246
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,390
I thought they'd fight after she stole Yukiko's boyfriend but...

247
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,990
You're too young to understand.

248
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,290
Didn't Kiyomi get on at the same Second Street Station like us?

249
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,590
That's right.

250
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,690
But she was sitting in the second car wasn't she?

251
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,790
People usually get on the car closest to the ticket gate.

252
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,190
It seems strange to deliberately walk to another car further away.

253
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,290
Not really, when the train stops at Kiyomi's stop

254
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,390
the ticket gate is right in front if you're in the second car.

255
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,290
That's why whenever we take the same train,

256
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,990
we have to walk to the second car.

257
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,190
Which means they knew she'd be in the second car.

258
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,390
I've got it, I've solved everything.

259
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,690
Inspector! We're done looking through all their possessions.

260
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,490
I apologize for the long wait.

261
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,790
You may all leave now.

262
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,490
If something comes up,

263
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,690
I'd appreciate it if you'd give us your cooperation.

264
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,490
Here we go again.

265
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,490
We can't have you leave just yet.

266
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,290
What's the matter, Mouri...

267
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,190
That pose!

268
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,490
This was no random killing.

269
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,090
The killer is one of you three.

270
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,690
One of us?

271
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,490
And the murder weapon is right among your things.

272
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,790
But Mouri...

273
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,990
We all have alibis, remember.

274
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,290
We're having dinner.

275
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,890
But it was still possible to kill her.

276
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,990
Firstly, the killer knew Kiyomi would leave early

277
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,990
so while seeing her off at the station,

278
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,290
the killer checked the schedule of the train she would take

279
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,290
and calculated how long it would take

280
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,190
for it to return carrying Kiyomi's body.

281
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,390
After that, all the killer had to do was go to dinner,

282
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,990
creating an alibi then retrieve the murder weapon

283
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,590
from the body when it returned.

284
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,890
Weapon?

285
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,090
What kind of weapon?

286
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,190
Don't you know?

287
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,190
Something that would appear natural when put onto the ears.

288
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,590
Yes, I see!

289
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,590
If you planted a poisoned needle in the headphone...

290
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,490
Right.

291
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,590
Which means the killer is Yukiko Mori.

292
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,090
Yes, you.

293
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,990
You broke Kiyomi's MD player

294
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,090
and lent her yours with the poisoned needle in it.

295
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,790
And pretending to buy more juice,

296
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,790
you boarded the front car and retrieved the weapon.

297
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:16,190
You knew Kiyomi always sat in the second car from the front.

298
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,790
It doesn't take long to get the weapon

299
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,890
since you know where she'd be.

300
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,590
But the cord was caught on her shoulder,

301
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,490
you pulled on it too hard and the headphone got bent.

302
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,990
I see, it certainly is bent.

303
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,490
The mark from the cord was found on her arm.

304
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,190
And her ears were laid back against her head

305
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,890
proving she had a headphone on.

306
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,190
I just went to buy some juice.

307
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,290
I didn't do what you just said.

308
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,790
Your friends body was in front of you,

309
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,690
you should have been in shock.

310
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,190
But for some reason, you fixed the collar on her dress.

311
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,290
I am sure it was because when the cord got caught,

312
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,290
it made the collar stand.

313
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,390
Actually you intended to retrieve the weapon

314
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,690
and leave the body.

315
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,590
But your friends came looking for you from the other car.

316
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,990
So you had to pretend you discovered the body with the other two

317
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,590
and play out your role.

318
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,990
So, the victim pricked her own ears with the poisoned needle

319
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,890
but why kill her in the train of all places?

320
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,990
There aren't too many passengers on this line on Sundays.

321
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,090
Very few people get into the second car.

322
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,490
It's the perfect place when you have to retrieve the weapon

323
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,790
after securing an alibi.

324
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,290
I see.

325
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,590
On top of that,

326
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,490
an unspecified number of people go in and out

327
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,190
so it's easier to make it appear a random killing.

328
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,390
All she had to do was make a mistake at work

329
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,390
so they'd all have to go in on a Sunday...

330
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,290
Proof, where's the proof?

331
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,490
I don't see anything that looks like a needle

332
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,190
I believe she used that handkerchief to pull it out

333
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,590
there was a piece of sponge stuck on it.

334
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,290
I was sitting here all the time.

335
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,890
Right here with all of you!

336
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,090
Then your things were being checked,

337
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,290
you said you didn't feel well and went off alone.

338
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,490
You mean she had to be alone so she could take the needle out.

339
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,890
May I see your handkerchief?

340
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,890
Alright.

341
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,290
It's no use now, Inspector.

342
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,190
It's a tiny needle.

343
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,990
She's probably already thrown it away somewhere.

344
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,590
Mouri, are you telling me this is all supposition

345
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,590
and you have no proof?

346
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,890
The proof is in that MD player.

347
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,890
What?

348
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,690
If you mean fingerprints, she was a friend,

349
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,490
it's only natural for hers to be on it.

350
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,290
I didn't lend it to her today.

351
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,190
Then will you take the disc out of it?

352
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,990
What's wrong?

353
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,990
Yukiko, thank you, by Kiyomi.

354
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,590
You didn't lend it to her.

355
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,590
You did say that, didn't you?

356
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,290
If you didn't lend it to her

357
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,990
how was she able to write a message dated today

358
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,490
and with the ballpoint pen we've found among her things?

359
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,190
You're right.

360
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,690
The color of these letters

361
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,090
matches the color of the pen found in her bag.

362
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,990
That's right, Kiyomi left you a message.

363
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,690
She never dreamed you were going to kill her.

364
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,290
Kiyomi.

365
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,190
I just couldn't forgive you.

366
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,290
You stole my boyfriend.

367
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,890
Today is his birthday,

368
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,990
I knew she would rush home.

369
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,390
So, that's why you chose today to kill her?

370
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,690
Takagi, did you find out how she got the poison?

371
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,790
Yes.

372
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,790
It's a fast acting alkaloid poison

373
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,490
they use on darts in South America.

374
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,890
She confessed that she bought some when she was abroad a few days ago.

375
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,190
She coated a tiny needle with it.

376
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,590
Poison for darts...

377
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,590
We took so long identifying the poison.

378
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,690
Mouri, if you hadn't figured things out,

379
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,690
this case might have gone solved.

380
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,090
Poison for darts, yes.

381
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,590
Well, I had a feeling that's what it was.

382
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,390
Really, so you figured that out too?

383
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,190
Mouri, you're great!

384
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,590
Give me a break.

385
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,390
You haven't even figured out I've been knocking you out.
