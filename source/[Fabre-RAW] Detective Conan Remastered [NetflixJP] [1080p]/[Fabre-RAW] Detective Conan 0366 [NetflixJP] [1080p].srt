1
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,023
The stage for today's episode is fishing.

2
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,823
A breakwater out at sea in clear view

3
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:27,623
but a murder is committed without anyone noticing.

4
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:29,223
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:30,923
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,123
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,317
Here. Watch your step, all of you.

8
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:13,517
The wind feels so good!

9
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,017
Listen, all of you!

10
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:18,117
We're going fishing out by the breakwater!

11
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:20,417
Be careful not to get too carried away

12
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,917
and fall into the ocean, all right?

13
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:23,217
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

14
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:29,317
How unusual to go out fishing to the sea.

15
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,517
Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,917
What's the problem?

17
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,017
Every time we decide to go somewhere,

18
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,217
it's always camping at the mountains,

19
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,117
so I'm sure that Dr. Agasa wanted us to experience something new!

20
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,017
Well... Sort of...

21
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:43,517
I'm not complaining or anything.

22
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:45,117
I already have a hunch that

23
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:48,217
since I've been avoiding going out to distant places with you guys,

24
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,917
you figured instead of taking me to the confinement of the mountains,

25
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:53,017
it would be better to take me out to see where the view is nice and clear.

26
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,117
Thanks to somebody's great idea, right?

27
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,217
Darn you.

28
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,217
-She hit the bull's eye. -She hit the bull's eye.

29
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:02,317
I guess it's not a bad idea for a change of scene

30
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:04,017
to come and feel the sea breeze of this vast ocean,

31
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,617
the mother of all creation.

32
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,917
But I think he should've just minded his own business.

33
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,217
What a snob!

34
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,817
Well... Regardless of her remarks,

35
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:18,117
I can tell that Ai is pretty happy about this.

36
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,617
You think so?

37
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:23,717
And, like she says, the ocean is the source of life.

38
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:26,017
The source of life?

39
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:28,917
Besides, it's a great place to relax.

40
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,917
Come to think of it, today is...

41
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:36,217
Oh, my... Are you all going to fish at the breakwater too?

42
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,717
Yes! We are.

43
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,817
Only until after noon, though!

44
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,517
Then, would you like to have a bet with me

45
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,317
and see how many fish we can catch by then?

46
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,617
A bet to see...

47
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:47,117
How many fish we can catch?

48
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:50,217
Let's bet one side dish from our lunch box!

49
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:52,317
"Kiriko Shirane (38)" -Lunch box? One side dish?

50
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,617
I'll bet my crab cream croquette.

51
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,417
It is very delicious!

52
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,117
Right, Kanetani?

53
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:59,217
Yeah.

54
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,517
"Mineto Kanetani (39)" -It's always great.

55
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,617
Just as expected of a fisherman's daughter.

56
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:07,017
You're tops when it comes to making dishes using seafood.

57
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:11,417
We're all lucky we get to eat the food that this beauty makes, you know?

58
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,417
Oh, cut it out, Kanetani.

59
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,217
But, we're only beginners.

60
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:18,817
You should have Ida give you advice then.

61
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,217
Ida?

62
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:24,117
He's the one who's navigating this ship right now.

63
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,517
A fisherman actively in business!

64
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:27,817
He's a super veteran that knows everything about fishing!

65
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,217
No way, no can do.

66
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,617
"Futoshi Ejiri (41)" -No matter how much advice you get,

67
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:33,917
you won't be able to fish anything.

68
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,317
Because you're "bozu" (no catch) to begin with

69
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,417
be it your brains or your age, you get it?

70
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:42,817
"Bozu" (No catch)?

71
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:46,517
I wonder if brains or age has anything to do with fishing?

72
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:50,517
He's just joking and saying that you won't catch any fish.

73
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,517
It's a pun, a play on words.

74
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:56,617
No need to trouble yourself over it, it's just an old man's joke.

75
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:59,417
That guy... Okay!

76
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,317
Let's ask the fisherman all kinds of questions

77
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,717
and fish up a lot of yellow tails and tunas!

78
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,117
You can't fish something that big.

79
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:15,917
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 1)"

80
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,617
Okay, I'll see you guys then.

81
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:21,217
I'll be back in three hours. Good luck.

82
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:24,217
"Iwao Ida (39)" -If something comes up call me right away, okay?

83
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,217
I'll come for you in 20 minutes!

84
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,217
What's the matter? Why are you doing that?

85
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:38,617
Because...

86
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,017
-Right? -Yes!

87
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:43,617
We went to ask him about fishing...

88
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,717
But he treated us too much like little kids

89
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,417
that we really got angry!

90
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:50,717
And, what did he say?

91
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,417
He said don't make loud noises with your friends.

92
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:58,617
That's right.

93
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:01,617
It's exactly as the fisherman says.

94
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,517
Why is he right?

95
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,917
If loud noises are made,

96
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,217
the sound of footsteps and such

97
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,117
will travel along the breakwater into the water,

98
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,317
surprising the fish and make them flee.

99
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,317
So, that fisherman was probably trying to tell you

100
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,317
that if you make too much noise your footsteps,

101
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:19,317
it will keep the fish away.

102
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:22,617
But he didn't have to say it that tone of voice!

103
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:25,017
Exactly! That's right!

104
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,017
Did he say anything else?

105
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,217
Well...

106
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,617
It's dangerous doing something like that.

107
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:37,917
What if the children copy him?

108
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,617
It will be bad.

109
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,517
The place over there, where the tetra pods are,

110
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:44,517
is Ejiri's usual fishing spot!

111
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:49,017
That man is not contented unless he gets to fish there.

112
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,517
But it's strange that

113
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:52,617
the tetra pod looks to be above the surface of the water.

114
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,417
Although it's so out off shore like this,

115
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,917
it's pretty shallow, isn't it?

116
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,617
Yes.

117
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,617
The rocks here a patterned in complex fashion.

118
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:04,117
That area over there is very deep, you see.

119
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,217
Well, but thanks to that,

120
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,917
this place is hard to enter for fishing,

121
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:10,917
that not too many people know of this place.

122
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:13,817
So, this is an extremely fantastic hidden fishing spot,

123
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,517
thanks to Ida's navigating skill.

124
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:20,417
I see, that's why there aren't other fishers around.

125
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,917
Let's give it our best shot.

126
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,017
After all, our lunch is at stake too.

127
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:31,917
But are you sure we can catch fish in a place like this?

128
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,617
Yeah. For fish, the breakwater is like

129
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:38,817
an artificially made hotel with a restaurant.

130
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,917
There'll be loads of fish!

131
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,117
Really?

132
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,717
There're lots of them?

133
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,117
But the fishing season is already...

134
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,117
Oh, no!

135
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:50,717
-a bit over... -This cooler box is so small!

136
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:51,917
What should we do?

137
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,017
We didn't figure things out too well.

138
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,017
What if we can't fit all the fish in?

139
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,717
Don't worry.

140
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:00,617
I'll eat them all up.

141
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:04,317
-What a thing to say, Genta, come off it! -Excuse me...

142
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,117
I'll aim for the record of youngest big catcher then.

143
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,217
Oh, just great.

144
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:11,917
I'll open up a fish shop then!

145
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,517
Yep... That's good idea.

146
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,017
You're not listening at all, you guys.

147
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:35,617
No fish at all.

148
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,917
I wonder if the fish are asleep?

149
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,417
Yeah, it's not even budging.

150
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,217
And it's such a clear day.

151
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:44,417
The fish don't bite because it's a clear day.

152
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,217
What do you mean?

153
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,017
It's not good if it's a fine day?

154
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:51,417
No, because the water is only this deep.

155
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,617
On a fine day when the water is transparent,

156
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,017
fish get suspicious and are on guard.

157
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,017
So it's actually better

158
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:01,417
if it were cloudy or drizzling a little.

159
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,517
Nevertheless, this is a good place.

160
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,517
So the fish will eventually start biting.

161
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,817
Well... I'd advise you not to get your hopes up too high.

162
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,217
What it all boils down to is

163
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,517
only people with patience are suited for fishing.

164
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,017
That's not true!

165
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,417
There are impatient people among fishing experts.

166
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,217
Exactly, impatient people are said to be suited for fishing

167
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:24,117
because they're concerned whether the bait's not too good,

168
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:26,317
whether where they are fishing is not good,

169
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,017
whether their tools aren't good enough.

170
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,817
So, they read up on fishing books,

171
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,617
take notice of fishing news,

172
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:35,117
check out the tides of the day and so forth.

173
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,217
They do a lot of research as well as try each and every kind of thing,

174
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:40,117
so impatient people are said to become good anglers faster.

175
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:43,717
Well, to become a good angler, experience is what counts!

176
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,717
The more effort you put in,

177
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:46,817
the more reward you get to receive from the sea.

178
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:49,917
That is you get to catch better fish too.

179
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,117
Well as for me,

180
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:55,217
I haven't received such a great gift from the ocean yet though.

181
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,217
Hey, Conan.

182
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:01,517
You said there are many different kinds of fish here, right?

183
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,617
Yeah.

184
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:04,617
Then can we catch sea bream here too?

185
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,717
That's impossible.

186
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,917
Why not? Why is it impossible?

187
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,017
There are no sea breams

188
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:13,617
unless you go to a place that's more out to the sea

189
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,517
with a depth of 30 to 70 meters.

190
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:18,317
But since the sea is connected,

191
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,517
a sea bream may go astray and come along, right?

192
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,417
Remember! There was a sea lion that did that too, right?

193
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:30,017
Yeah, all we have to do is catch fish that come swimming astray.

194
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:32,817
Even whales come swimming astray at times too.

195
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:33,817
Come on...

196
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,117
I guess we can't fish for whales though...

197
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:39,317
Well, we've got lots of time,

198
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,017
so I guess we'll just have to stick it out, right, Conan?

199
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,417
Oh, yeah, let's do our best.

200
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:46,617
Did you catch something?

201
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,017
Oh, no...

202
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,717
My bobber drifted away.

203
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:54,117
Gosh. It's because you didn't push it in nicely into the bobber rubber.

204
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:55,917
But...

205
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,417
What is it now?

206
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,317
Look, Ai's bobber is moving!

207
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:03,817
Caught a fish!

208
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,417
Keep your cool, Haibara!

209
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,817
Pull! Pull!

210
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,917
-Just a little more! -Hang in there!

211
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,017
Don't rush!

212
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,017
That's right, you're doing good!

213
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,617
-She did it! -She did it!

214
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,217
It sure is tiny, though.

215
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:31,517
A tiny girella?

216
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,917
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

217
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:37,517
What do you think you're doing?

218
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:40,617
It's fishing manners to return trash fish into the sea, isn't it?

219
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,917
I guess you're right.

220
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,717
What a waste.

221
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,917
But the next time you put the fish back into the sea,

222
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,617
it's better to cool your hands with the water in the bucket

223
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:49,217
before throwing in the fish.

224
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:54,217
Because the body temperature of humans is too warm for the fish

225
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:56,117
and it would get burned!

226
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,117
You sure like to pick on people, don't you?

227
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:04,417
I just said that it would be better to do so!

228
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:08,317
But now we know that we can fish here too!

229
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,617
I'm going to change places and go fish over on that side.

230
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:12,617
Hey!

231
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:14,117
I want to fish for sea bream!

232
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,317
Don't run!

233
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,717
Oh, right. Sea bream...

234
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,917
I've told you, it's impossible.

235
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,426
Talk about not being able to fish anything

236
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,526
You can say that again.

237
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,626
Who was it that was saying

238
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,426
let's fish for yellowtail and tuna?

239
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:49,026
Talk about not even budging.

240
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:52,826
Well, to become a good angler, experience is what counts!

241
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,426
Okay! Experience is what it takes, experience.

242
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,926
I'm going to go over to everyone else and see how they're doing.

243
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:03,226
Please don't run.

244
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:05,026
I know...

245
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:09,726
Their fishing manners have improved.

246
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,426
Fantastic...

247
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:22,726
Thank you.

248
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,226
Good luck!

249
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:28,526
I wonder if she'll become a professional angler when she grows up.

250
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:33,526
Ayumi, did you learn anything?

251
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:38,126
He taught me how to hook the bait on and a lot of other things.

252
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,726
Really?

253
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,126
Maybe I'll have him teach me too.

254
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,726
There seems to be a lot of fish below

255
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,726
and I wonder why I still can't seem to catch anything?

256
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:50,926
He told me that the flow of the current is not good right now.

257
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:54,626
I see. The flow of the current?

258
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,726
I'm going to catch a fish today, no matter what it takes.

259
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:00,426
If I can't fish anything today, when else can I?

260
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:07,226
No fish.

261
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,726
You can say that again.

262
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:12,026
Well, but the veterans over there haven't caught any either.

263
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,026
So I guess it can't be helped.

264
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:17,026
I'd like to at least catch one fish.

265
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:19,026
True, if we don't catch any,

266
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,626
the man will really make fun of us.

267
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,026
I'm getting sleepy again

268
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:27,426
It's come!

269
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,626
-Really? -No doubt about it.

270
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:30,926
I've caught one!

271
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:33,126
Hang in there, Mitsuhiko!

272
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,626
I did it! I finally caught one!

273
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:44,726
You did it! Mitsuhiko! You did it!

274
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,226
You did it, Mitsuhiko!

275
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:49,126
It's a nicely shaped mackerel!

276
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,526
Genta! I caught one!

277
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,226
See!

278
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,026
You caught one? Really?

279
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:59,126
Look... It's this big.

280
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,926
Mitsuhiko caught it!

281
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:02,226
Yeap!

282
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:05,226
I'm happy for you!

283
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,526
I mean, it's so small...

284
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:10,426
As for me, I'm going for the big one. A sea bream!

285
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,426
You did it, didn't you, Mitsuhiko!

286
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:14,326
You really know how to "make it roll" (mackerel)?

287
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:18,326
You did it, I've lost the bet.

288
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,226
Is this your bobber?

289
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:23,426
My bobber?

290
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:24,826
Thank you.

291
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,726
It drifted away.

292
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,226
Why do you have it?

293
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,826
Make sure you keep in on tight next time.

294
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,626
Okay!

295
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:38,126
The crab cream croquette she gave us sure is good, isn't it?

296
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:42,326
Eating in a place like this makes lunch taste even better, doesn't it?

297
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:45,026
Yes! It's delicious!

298
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,226
Nothing yet.

299
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:52,226
I guess Conan was right about no sea breams being here.

300
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:55,726
This is the worst time of day for fishing.

301
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,226
Morning or sundown is way better.

302
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:00,426
It seems everyone's having a hard time too.

303
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,726
No bite what so ever.

304
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:06,026
Maybe I'll try changing the bait.

305
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:08,826
How about you? Anything?

306
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:11,726
No, nothing at all!

307
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,426
I wonder if the bait is on all right?

308
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:18,426
What's this? I feel something pulling.

309
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:19,826
It's big!

310
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:23,426
Conan, a whale! I can't lift it up!

311
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,426
It looks like your fishing line is tangled up somewhere.

312
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:31,226
Tangled? Is there a fish called tangled?

313
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:32,426
It's not a fish.

314
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,626
Your line got caught and stuck to seaweed or a rock or something.

315
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,726
It's not a fish?

316
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,826
Then what do I do?

317
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:40,826
Don't pull too hard,

318
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:43,326
but rather, loosen and pull.

319
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:44,526
Like this?

320
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,426
Right, good. Repeat the process.

321
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:49,726
It's free.

322
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:53,426
What's this?

323
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,826
You sure fished a big one.

324
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,026
Shoots, bait gone again.

325
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:06,326
Even the expert angler Ejiri is having a bad day today.

326
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,526
It looks like things aren't going well over there either.

327
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,526
Is it because of the tide?

328
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,426
Genta, aren't you going to eat lunch?

329
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:20,626
Yeah, I'll eat in a little while!

330
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:25,526
I can't believe that Genta is still not eating.

331
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:29,326
Yep... I wonder if he wants to fish sea bream that badly?

332
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,826
Sea bream is Genta's dream, please let him fish a sea bream.

333
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:35,826
-Dr. Agasa! -Sorry.

334
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:40,026
Even so,

335
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,626
I'm so hungry right now.

336
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,926
Should eat my lunch or fish for the sea bream?

337
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:48,926
Will it be lunch or the sea bream?

338
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,826
It's lunch first after all!

339
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:56,426
Eating lunch while bathing in sea wind makes lunch tastier after all.

340
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,926
Don't you think so too, Ai?

341
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,426
Aren't you glad you came?

342
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,226
Take your time and eat.

343
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,026
I've got no time to lose, you see.

344
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,326
The lunch tastes great here.

345
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,426
Thank you for the meal.

346
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:22,326
A record high eating speed.

347
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,026
Okay, I've finish eating my share,

348
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:26,326
now all I need is for the fish to eat my bait.

349
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:28,426
Come on, my dear sea bream.

350
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:29,626
Genta.

351
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,226
Oh, it's the ship!

352
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:59,126
It's that time of day already?

353
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,826
Shall we get ready to go, then?

354
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,326
Right.

355
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,426
He's already come for us. How fast.

356
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:08,126
Next, it's curry party time at Dr. Agasa house.

357
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:09,326
That's right.

358
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:11,926
Besides, maybe we can have mackerel sashimi.

359
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,226
Rather, I guess it's too small for sashimi.

360
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:15,426
Mackerel, slash me.

361
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:16,426
Dr. Agasa!

362
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,126
How'd you do, caught anything?

363
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:26,226
Of course we caught nothing, as empty as no hair on my head.

364
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:29,226
Well, that's too bad.

365
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,826
How about you guys?

366
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:32,326
Empty here too.

367
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:34,626
I caught one small mackerel.

368
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,526
Big catch, big catch.

369
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:39,826
I say, we should change fishing spots from this afternoon.

370
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:43,026
True. But what about Ejiri...

371
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:47,126
He said that he's going to stick it out here till late in the day today.

372
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:50,826
Really? I'll go talk it over with Ida then.

373
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:01,626
Hey, Genta, give up already.

374
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,126
We're going back.

375
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,226
Okay.

376
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,926
He says he'll go around over to where he went before.

377
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,026
Oh, that's good.

378
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:11,726
You're going to change places?

379
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,826
Yes, this place is no good today.

380
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:18,126
There's another spot nearby where we fished a lot before.

381
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,826
We're stopping by for a while.

382
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:22,026
Well, we're in no rush.

383
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:24,526
So, we're all going back together then?

384
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,426
No, Ejiri's going to stay there.

385
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,026
We're going to leave him behind alone?

386
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,626
No need to worry,

387
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:36,026
because Ida's boat will come for him again at sundown.

388
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:40,426
Ejiri really likes that place, doesn't he?

389
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,526
It sure was a lot of fun.

390
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:46,626
I'd like to come again.

391
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,526
Yes, next time I'd like to come

392
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:51,226
after doing some research as Dr. Agasa suggested.

393
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:56,026
Hey! We're going back!

394
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:58,726
Shoots, I wanted to fish. A sea bream.

395
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:01,126
All I fished was seaweed!

396
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,726
Another false call?

397
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:09,926
Okay, we'll be on our way then!

398
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,826
Good luck!

399
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,926
No use calling out to him.

400
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:16,326
Once he starts fishing,

401
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:19,426
he's reticent and hardly ever talks!

402
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:20,426
Right.

403
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:21,826
He was saying that he's going to stick it out today too,

404
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:23,626
until he gets a big catch.

405
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:26,326
But he sure makes a lot of noise when he gets a big catch.

406
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,626
Just the other day, he got so excited that he almost fell off.

407
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,426
He sure is quiet today, though?

408
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,926
He's probably in deep thought or something.

409
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,226
So, shall we get going?

410
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:48,426
It seems like he gotten a bite.

411
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:49,726
Yes, he's got a bite.

412
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,226
There's a bite. Don't you realize it?

413
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:56,026
Ejiri! You got a bite!

414
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:57,426
Ejiri?

415
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:59,526
What's up? What's all the racket about?

416
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,226
That man seems to be asleep...

417
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:04,826
Asleep? You mean Ejiri?

418
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:05,926
No way.

419
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,526
What's the matter with him?

420
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:13,726
Ejiri?

421
00:22:17,326 --> 00:22:19,626
Hey! Ejiri...

422
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:24,226
Ejiri?

423
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,426
What's up?

424
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:26,926
What's wrong?

425
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:28,126
What's going on?

426
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,526
Ejiri!

427
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:34,453
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,053
"Festival"

429
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,053
In the next episode, the case is solved.

430
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:39,453
The fishing case is finished!

431
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:40,853
What was that?
