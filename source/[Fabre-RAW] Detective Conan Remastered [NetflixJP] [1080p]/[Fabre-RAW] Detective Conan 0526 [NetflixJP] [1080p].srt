00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,058
"A man working at a securities company is killed in his condo."

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:09,558
"The murder weapon is a hunting rifle."

4
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:12,858
"The police is investigating the case as murder from a grudge."

5
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,558
But, how frightening,

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,758
that condo is near here, isn't it?

7
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,658
The culprit could be hiding anywhere nearby...

8
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:22,001
Azusa?

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,658
"Azusa Enomoto (23)" -I'm sorry.

10
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:27,058
I'll make a new one and bring it right away!

11
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,009
Are you all right? You look pale.

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,458
Really?

13
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,658
Come to think of it,

14

"Sugihito Enomoto (28)" -your older brother

15
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:38,358
also practices shooting, doesn't he?

16
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:40,019
What does that have to do with anything?

17
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,358
Sugihito does sporting clays, not rifle hunting.

18
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:48,758
But it looks like there are a lot of people here with scary faces

19
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,758
who suspect that he's involved.

20
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,458
Now that you mentioned it,

21
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,658
there are a lot of people

22
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:57,158
with threatening looks on their faces in this shop.

23
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:00,858
Some of the guys look sort of familiar, too.

24
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:03,058
The person sitting there at the counter

25
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:06,045
looks exactly like a man I know.

26
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,858
If I'm not mistaken, aren't you...

27
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:17,058
Officer Takagi. What're you doing?

28
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:21,058
A crisis is gracefully revived.

29
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,358
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

30
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,058
Coffee Shop Poirot is full of police officers.

31
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:27,158
The parcel that is delivered is full of mystery.

32
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,658
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:30,658
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,758

"A Delivery From The Real Culprit"

36
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:19,447
What? Sugihito is being suspected?

37
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,447
You mean about this securities businessman's case?

38
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:24,647
Yes. The victim, Mr. Takafumi Torihira

39
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:28,187
is Azusa's older brother, Sugihito's boss.

40
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:30,189
And his fingerprints were found

41
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,191
on the rifle left back at the scene of the crime.

42
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,847
Moreover, when we went to his apartment, no one was there,

43
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,547
and he seems to have been absent from work without contacting the company.

44
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:41,547
We're staking out here because he may just contact

45
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:43,547
his younger sister.

46
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,447
I see.

47
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:48,647
And? Did your brother contact you?

48
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,209
I already told the officers too.

49
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:54,213
Yes, just once, telling me not to worry.

50
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:58,217
Besides, he told me that he's innocent

51
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,647
and hasn't done anything!

52
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:02,221
Exactly.

53
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,223
I'm sure it's a mistake.

54
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,947
Who are you?

55
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,747
"Touji Kawase (28)" -He's Mr. Kawase,

56
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,547
who works with my brother.

57
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:14,847
I came by here on business, so I stopped by.

58
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:18,247
The fingerprints that were found on the rifle,

59
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:21,347
were they really Sugihito's prints?

60
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,347
Yeah, no doubt about it.

61
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,347
That's probably because 4 or 5 members from our company

62
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:27,847
including him went to Mr. Torihira's condo the other day,

63
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,249
and were shown a rifle there.

64
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:34,047
Maybe that's why they found his fingerprints on it.

65
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,947
Back then, he was touching the rifle with great interest

66
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,547
and even looked into the gun barrel.

67
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,947
Why with great interest?

68
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,547
He also does sporting clay, doesn't he?

69
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:47,247
No, shotguns are used in sporting clay.

70
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,547
He was excited saying that

71
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:51,647
it was the first time he ever touched a hunting rifle.

72
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,047
Excited?

73
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:55,947
But, it doesn't seem your brother had anything against this Mr. Torihira

74
00:04:55,947 --> 00:05:00,279
because he obviously went over to spend time at his house.

75
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,047
No, brother used to tell me

76
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:05,547
that he was a very strict boss, but a good person.

77
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,147
Strict?

78
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:10,289
It seems that Mr. Torihira took special notice of Enomoto

79
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,947
because he was competent.

80
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:15,747
Enomoto was frequently scolded severely by Mr. Torihira

81
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,297
in front of everyone else.

82
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,447
Well, I guess you could call it "strictness born from love".

83
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,547
If the prints just coincidentally got on the rifle,

84
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:27,047
why did he have to flee?

85
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,847
Moreover, it seems that

86
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,247
he made it out of his apartment in an extreme rush.

87
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,311
An extreme rush?

88
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,547
Yeah. The front door was left unlocked,

89
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:39,147
and even his cash card and wallet were left behind.

90
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:43,047
And, those aren't the only things he left behind upon fleeing.

91
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:44,323
At a trash dump near his apartment,

92
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,847
we found his dress shirt

93
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,329
that was smeared with an unbelievable amount of blood on it.

94
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:52,331
Oh, no!

95
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,347
And, that blood was...

96
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:59,147
Yes, it was found to be Mr. Torihira's blood through DNA tests.

97
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:03,047
But, how did you find out it was Sugihito's dress shirt?

98
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,547
His fingerprints were also found

99
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:07,947
on the buttons of that shirt.

100
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:11,547
I have a picture of it too.

101
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,147
Does it look familiar?

102
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:14,647
I can't say...

103
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,747
It look like a dress shirt that can be found anywhere, so...

104
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,357
May I see it too?

105
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,359
Conan.

106
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,747
This is...

107
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:25,647
I guess I'll be heading back to the company then.

108
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,547
It's an hour drive from here,

109
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,247
so it's about time I get going.

110
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:32,947
Oh, yes. Your company's in Kanagawa.

111
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:35,347
If he ever contacts you,

112
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,447
let me know by mail, okay?

113
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:41,447
I'll try to convince him to stop running around and go to the police.

114
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:43,847
If he happens to get caught while on the run,

115
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,385
he may be set up as the culprit, besides.

116
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,147
Okay.

117
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,847
See you.

118
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,647
Thank you for coming all this way.

119
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,447
Was that man a good friend of your brother?

120
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,047
Yep. It seems that they started working for the same section

121
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,047
of the company from last month

122
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,347
and suddenly became friends.

123
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:08,407
I heard that he recently used to stay over at Sugihito's place a lot.

124
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,547
After all, his apartment is near the company.

125
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,447
Oh, I see.

126
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:19,247
I'm sorry that we police officers are intruding on you like this too.

127
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,647
Oh, not at all. If I'm going to be watched either way,

128
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,423
it doesn't matter if it's from the inside or outside.

129
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:29,547
And I'd also like to prove that my brother isn't the culprit.

130
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:34,433
Just as I thought your room would be, Azusa.

131
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,847
It's cute.

132
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,047
You think so?

133
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,447
What a load of gifts too!

134
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,247
Are these from the patrons of Poiroit?

135
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,447
No. They're all from my brother.

136
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,847
He frequently buys queer gifts on his business trips

137
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,247
and sends them to me.

138
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,047
Talking about sending me stuff,

139
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:56,455
he also sends me queer pictures taken on his cell.

140
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,247
Even last night,

141
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:01,847
he sent me this strange photo.

142
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,347
Snow?

143
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,847
Did it snow last night?

144
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:07,847
I guess it snowed quite a bit,

145
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,147
where my brother's apartment is.

146
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:13,347
Brother said he also sent it to Mr. Kawase.

147
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,347
But, can you imagine a person

148
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:17,747
who sends pictures like this killing somebody?

149
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,647
True.

150
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:22,481
Besides, brother told me when he called me this morning

151
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:26,047
that he uses a shotgun for sporting clay,

152
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,747
and that handling a hunting rifle

153
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,947
is not easy.

154
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:33,447
Well, about handling and stuff, it was...

155
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,495
A guest?

156
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,247
Were you expecting anyone?

157
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,647
No.

158
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,147
Which means...

159
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,747
Don't tell me it's...

160
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:50,047
Hello, delivery.

161
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,947
What is it?

162
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,547
Nothing.

163
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:55,747
Who is it from?

164
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:59,847
It's from Mr. Sugihito Enomoto.

165
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,247
Brother.

166
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,347
I hope you don't mind me checking the contents.

167
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,147
Go ahead.

168
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,537
-Here. -Thank you.

169
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:24,347
It's assorted cookies.

170
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:28,847
Hey, maybe there's a letter or something inside?

171
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:33,447
It doesn't look to be so.

172
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,847
Azusa, do the cookies bring anything to mind?

173
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:40,559
Azusa?

174
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,047
The cookies?

175
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:46,565
I love cookies, I think that's why he sent it to me.

176
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:50,147
See. The more he can't be a person would kill, right?

177
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:52,047
True.

178
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:58,577
Oh, that's right. I have to go out shopping now.

179
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:03,447
To the neighborhood supermarket to buy groceries and a few other things.

180
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,447
Would you like to come along?

181
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,447
Oh, yes, of course.

182
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,589
The person who first found the corpse

183
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:14,593
was Mrs. Torihira who came back this morning from a trip.

184
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,595
Yes, the estimated time of murder is

185
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,247
probably between 22:00 - 23:00 last night.

186
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,847
Yes, right. Just around that time last night,

187
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:25,247
I had a hell of a time.

188
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,605
Hell of a time?

189
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,247
I had to go to the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department

190
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,247
but the freeway was blocked

191
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,847
and the trains were delayed too.

192
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,547
An accident or something?

193
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,947
No, not an accident.

194
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,621
Yes, this is Chiba.

195
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,647
Oh, Officer Takagi. What is it?

196
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:50,147
Azusa split on you?

197
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,147
Yeah, a message saying where to meet him

198
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,847
was in the box of cookies she received a while ago, after all.

199
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,635
It can't be! There was no message in it.

200
00:10:56,847 --> 00:11:00,639
No, a message was definitely written there.

201
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:04,347
In an unexpected place that only Azusa would notice.

202
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:08,447
Moreover, the person who sent it wasn't Sugihito,

203
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:11,147
but most probably the real culprit.

204
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:15,347
He probably called Azusa to conceal everything.

205
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:17,847
That person who from his own side,

206
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:21,447
called himself a murderer through the slip of his tongue.

207
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:29,681
You idiot!

208
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,881
Accompanying the younger sister of the suspect,

209
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,481
and yet letting her get away from you. What do you think you're doing?

210
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:35,181
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:40,281
Ms. Enomoto, previously cooperated in solving cases

212
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,181
so I didn't think she would flee.

213
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:46,270
The one that is suspected of killing Mr. Torihira

214
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,781
is Azusa's older brother, Sugihito Enomoto.

215
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:51,581
The more she's a good younger sister,

216
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:54,481
the more she would want to help her brother who is in trouble.

217
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,695
Didn't that dawn on you?

218
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,281
What would you have done then, Inspector?

219
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,481
She told me that she wanted to go

220
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:04,703
to the underwear section to shop, so to wait a while.

221
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,705
I would've gone along with her anyway.

222
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,981
What if she says it's okay to go with her,

223
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:11,081
but to not watch her too closely

224
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,781
when she's choosing underwear!

225
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,981
If she says that with a slightly

226
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:17,981
troubled blushing face?

227
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,881
Then what?

228
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:21,781
Well, then I would have no choice.

229
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,881
Azusa pretty shrewd, isn't she?

230
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,181
Yep.

231
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,781
Come on. Stuff like that doesn't matter at this point!

232
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,181
The problem here is that

233
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:34,733
we've completely lost track of the suspect.

234
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,481
But, Inspector,

235
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:39,681
is Sugihito really the culprit?

236
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,281
His fingerprints were found on the murder weapon,

237
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,481
the rifle, and on top of that he's on the run right now.

238
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,745
And, furthermore, the blood smeared dress shirt

239
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
that was found in trash box.

240
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,681
The blood that had splattered is Mr. Torihira's blood

241
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:53,381
and the fingerprints of Sugihito Enomoto

242
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,755
have also been found on the buttons of the dress shirt.

243
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,681
I guess we can say

244
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:59,381
there's a 10 to 1 chance that he's the culprit.

245
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,981
Oh, no!

246
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,763
Hey, Conan, just what do you think you're doing?

247
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:08,781
I got thirsty so I wanted to get the coke in the refrigerator.

248
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:11,481
But, the coke gushed out.

249
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:16,181
Huh? My elbows and underarms aren't all that wet.

250
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:19,581
It's probably because you opened the can with your arms fixed in place.

251
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,781
I see.

252
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,281
Armpits close against the body...

253
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:26,785
Inspector, there's something strange about this dress shirt.

254
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,181
What's strange about it?

255
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,981
Take a look at this, the armpit and elbow part.

256
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,793
Blood is splattered evenly and also on these parts.

257
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,681
Judging from the large amount of blood that is splattered on the shirt,

258
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:41,081
the rifle must've been fired from point blank range.

259
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,481
In other words, the culprit didn't have to look through the scope,

260
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,681
but rather just held it under his arm and fired.

261
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:48,581
If so, the blood that would've splattered on the sides

262
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,809
and elbows should've been blocked.

263
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,581
However, since the dress shirt is bloody all over,

264
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,813
that's what somebody probably set up.

265
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:58,817
No, it's only natural that the shirt is bloody all over.

266
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:02,481
Mr. Torihira wasn't shot with the rifle,

267
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:06,570
but rather, struck to death with the handle part.

268
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,881
Is that so?

269
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,581
I also thought that he was shot with a rifle too.

270
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:16,381
But, there was somebody who said exactly that, wasn't there?

271
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:20,470
Remember, Sugihito's colleague at work called Mr. Kawase.

272
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,843
He said that Sugihito was looking with interest into the gun barrel.

273
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,581
In other words, he wanted to say

274
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:31,181
that Sugihito's fingerprints are on the rifle, right?

275
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,181
It seems to be true that the culprit held the part of the rifle

276
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:35,781
that's easiest to hold and struck the victim.

277
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,781
How did Mr. Kawase know about this?

278
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,857
When the only thing announced in the papers

279
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,481
is that the murder weapon is a rifle.

280
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,781
That's because Mr. Kawase is the very person who struck him.

281
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:49,781
His tongue slipped because he is indeed the culprit.

282
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:53,870
But, didn't Mr. Kawase try to stand up for Sugihito?

283
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,581
He's the one that told us that Sugihito's fingerprints were there

284
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,581
because he touched it before, right?

285
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:00,879
But, back then,

286
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,281
he also said that Sugihito was excited, right?

287
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,781
He also said that Mr. Torihira

288
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,581
thought Sugihito was a capable man.

289
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:11,781
I remember him saying that

290
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,893
Sugihito was scolded a lot by Mr. Torihira, too.

291
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,381
I see. It looks like he's trying to back him up,

292
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,981
but it could be the exact opposite.

293
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,081
But Mr. Sugihito Enomoto's fingerprints

294
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,781
were also found on the buttons of this dress shirt...

295
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:28,481
Oh, that's right. Mr. Kawase also said that

296
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:30,481
he stayed over a lot at Sugihito's place,

297
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,781
because his apartment was near the company.

298
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:37,481
I see! If he goes to work the next day after staying over,

299
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:40,919
he could've borrowed the dress shirt.

300
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,981
In other words, he could've kept the dress shirt he borrowed,

301
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:47,281
wore it just before committing the crime, then carried out his thing.

302
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,481
Right. Then, he disposed of it

303
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,931
at a trash dump near the Sugihito's apartment after committing the crime.

304
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,581
Then, why did he flee?

305
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,937
Maybe Mr. Kawase told him to.

306
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,281
By saying something like, "You touched that rifle, didn't you?

307
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:04,681
If you're arrested now, you'll be caught and made the culprit."

308
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:08,081
It could be that Azusa was also called out by Mr. Kawase.

309
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:09,281
What?

310
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:12,481
Why does he have to call her out, too?

311
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:14,953
Oh, well... I just kind of thought so.

312
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,481
The cell phone photo, I think.

313
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:21,570
Remember, Sugihito sent an interesting picture

314
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,781
to Azusa last night, right?

315
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,965
It seems like he also sent it to the person called Kawase,

316
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:30,969
so I'm sure that man wanted to have it all to himself.

317
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,973
How stupid can you get? Why would he want to have

318
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,681
such a silly picture like that all for himself?

319
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:38,281
Snow?

320
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:41,581
That picture was of snow.

321
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:44,081
Officer Chiba, didn't you have a tough time last night

322
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,985
because of the snow?

323
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:51,281
Yeah. Just around the time of the murder between 22:00 and 23:00

324
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,991
when I was returning from the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department,

325
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,381
the freeway was closed and the trains were delayed because of the snow.

326
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,997
Hey, Sugihito's apartment

327
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,281
was near his company in Kanagawa, right?

328
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:05,003
Yes, an hour or so away from here.

329
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:09,007
The murder was committed in a condo in this neighbourhood...

330
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,881
Won't that picture serve as evidence?

331
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:16,681
Because transportation was paralyzed by snow.

332
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:20,770
Yeah, though digital photos are rarely used as evidence.

333
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,681
But, if the culprit thought it could be used,

334
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:25,781
he could've called out Sugihito's younger sister

335
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:29,027
and told her to bring the photo in her cell phone

336
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,029
in order to get rid of the evidence.

337
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,481
But, how did he call her out?

338
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:35,981
What we should suspect is the assorted cookies

339
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:39,037
that came for Sugihito just a while ago.

340
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,681
Is it Azusa's birthday today?

341
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,681
I wonder... I don't think so, though. Why?

342
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:48,481
Because the parcel had a ribbon wrapped around it,

343
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,781
so I thought maybe it was a special present.

344
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:55,053
Well, since all the other parcels that Sugihito sent her

345
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,081
didn't have ribbons around them,

346
00:17:56,081 --> 00:18:00,281
so that's why Azusa thought, "What kind it be?", right?

347
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:03,061
Hey! Where did she put that ribbon?

348
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,681
I'm sure she threw it in the trash basket together with the wrapper.

349
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:15,581
A vacant warehouse 4 in 3rd district, Okuhocho.

350
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:17,075
Contact the police in this jurisdiction,

351
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,077
-and have them dispatch officers immediately. -Yes, sir.

352
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,781
Are we going to make it in time?

353
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:25,681
No, we most likely won't make it in time,

354
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,381
starting off now.

355
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:31,981
Sugihito, where are you?

356
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,881
You're here, aren't you? Sugihito!

357
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,781
Oh, Azusa?

358
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,181
Sugihito.

359
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,881
Why'd you come here?

360
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,101
What do you mean why?

361
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,681
You wrote the address of this place

362
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,981
on the ribbon of the parcel you sent me and told to come here.

363
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:51,481
That's why I mailed Mr. Kawase, too and called him out here.

364
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,881
So that he could convince you to stop running around

365
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:57,581
and go to the police if you're really innocent.

366
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,581
Stop running around? I mean he's the one who told me

367
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:03,781
to run for it and hide here, too.

368
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,681
He? Just what do you mean?

369
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,129
Azusa!

370
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,781
This is what it means.

371
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,481
I've been waiting for two hours now, Azusa,

372
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:20,781
for you to come here.

373
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,481
You were waiting here?

374
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:23,581
Yeah.

375
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:27,145
Because you sent me such a meaningless cell phone picture.

376
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:31,149
Okay then. You brought your cell phone with you like I told you to.

377
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,881
Cell phone photo? You mean the one I sent you last night?

378
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,481
Yeah, it'll serve as your alibi, despite me

379
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:40,081
going out of my way to set you up as the killer.

380
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:43,181
Don't tell me that you're the one who killed department head Torihira?

381
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,581
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:47,981
I bought the stocks of the company and really lost out

383
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:50,581
and had a debt of 1 billion yen.

384
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:53,681
And old man Torihira found out about it.

385
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,481
He told me that he'll make me pay him back

386
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:59,177
even if I have to do so all my life, so I shut him up.

387
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,179
It was right after that

388
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,381
I got that cell phone picture from you.

389
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:08,981
If you didn't send me that cell phone photo,

390
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:11,681
Azusa didn't have to die.

391
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,681
Wait!

392
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,281
If you don't want your little sister to die,

393
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,281
write a will right here and now.

394
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,981
Later put your neck through the rope.

395
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:22,781
And you know what to do, right?

396
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:24,881
Why you!

397
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,981
If you write it well, I'll save your little sister.

398
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,481
Fortunately, she hasn't heard my voice

399
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,211
and it seems she also trusted me too,

400
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,481
so write it well, now. Bad mouth Torihira

401
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:39,217
and write the reason why you decided to stop running.

402
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:43,221
Write a prize sob story that will bring tears to the dumb police.

403
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,781
No, no!

404
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,781
That won't bring tears to our eyes at all.

405
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,381
I mean a silly story like that would dry tears

406
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:53,231
rather than make them flow.

407
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,281
If I were you, I would rewrite the script this way.

408
00:20:56,281 --> 00:21:01,239
A tomboy police officer raids the site in the nick of time

409
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,781
and succeeds in getting hold of the suspect.

410
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,581
I think this story will be more favoured

411
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,245
being it's a happy ending, don't you?

412
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,681
Why's a police officer here?

413
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:12,581
Nobody was tailing Azusa!

414
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:15,253
I came here directly from a different route.

415
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,981
Don't tell me that ribbon trick was disclosed?

416
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:22,481
It could be, because I was contacted by mail to come here

417
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,681
since the real culprit will be coming here.

418
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,781
Well, as to who the person that contacted me is,

419
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:30,781
I will not reveal it since I was told not to tell.

420
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:07,981
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.

421
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,181
I was scolded a bit at the police station.

422
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,881
After all, I fled from the police officer.

423
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,981
Well, everything turned out fine.

424
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:17,381
Your brother was found innocent too.

425
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:21,379
Now, you'll be freed by all those officers with threatening looking eyes.

426
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,081
Hey, hey, officers are still around?

427
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:29,981
Oh, the officers come here often these days,

428
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:32,181
ever since they ate the special pasta dish

429
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:34,281
the other day when they were staking me out,

430
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,181
saying that it's really delicious.

431
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:39,681
Is something wrong?

432
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:43,401
Oh, no... I'm happy for you.

433
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:45,881
Boy! It looks so much like the officers room

434
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,081
that I don't feel comfortable.

435
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,010
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,760
"Stone coffin"

437
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,848
Stone but it's not the Rolling Stones!

438
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,300
Repent Takagi!
