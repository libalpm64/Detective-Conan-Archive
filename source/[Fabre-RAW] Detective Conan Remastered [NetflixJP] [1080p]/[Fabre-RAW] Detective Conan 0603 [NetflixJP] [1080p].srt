1
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:16,502
You're lost after all, aren't you?

2
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:19,202
I've known that for ages already!

3
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:22,302
I told you to make a left back there.

4
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:27,402
There's a house!

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,102
What? Saved!

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,002
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

7
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,402
Tears are start of all dramas.

8
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:42,002
A gathering of fervent fans.

9
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,402
The locked room mystery of and idol that disappeared.

10
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,102
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:48,102
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:50,602
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,139
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (First Locked room)"

14
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,939
Excuse me! Is anybody home?

15
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,039
Excuse me!

16
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,839
Oh, sorry to bother you, but we got lost.

17
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,639
Ran...

18
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,839
Why it's you, Mr. Mouri?

19
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,039
Oh, you're...

20
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,939
Mr. Yatsukawa of Nichiuri TV?

21
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,639
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the prominent great detective?

22
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,239
I'm sorry that we surprised you a while ago.

23
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,739
He is comic writer, Mr. Reiki Hirasaka.

24
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,139
Oh, are you the one who wrote "The Blackmagic Girl"?

25
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,739
Many girls in my class are reading it.

26
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,139
That's an honor, my lady.

27
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,439
What's this Blackmagic Girl about?

28
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,839
It's Mr. Hirasaka's representative work

29
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,639
and a masterpiece of all occult comics!

30
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,939
It's a story about the main character resurrecting into the world

31
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,039
as a witch to avenge her death.

32
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,839
She's Shoko Utakura, a gravure model in the making!

33
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:01,439
I'll be debuting soon, how do you do?

34
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,539
What're you all gathered here for today?

35
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:08,539
Right, I mean you being dressed up like that too, Mr. Yatsukawa.

36
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,139
Oh, this is...

37
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,539
We're planning to hold a seance tonight.

38
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,439
A seance?

39
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,339
You mean the thing you do when you want to summon

40
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,339
the spirit of the dead?

41
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,339
That's it.

42
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,439
The spirit of who that died?

43
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,339
Our idol, Kira Miyahara!

44
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,439
Kira Miyahara?

45
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,539
Oh, if I remember correctly.

46
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,239
The one who was supposed to be the lead actress

47
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,239
in the movie "The Blackmagic Girl".

48
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,639
Supposed to be?

49
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,939
She died a year ago of an accident.

50
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,039
The production of the movie was eventually cancelled.

51
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,839
If only that accident didn't happen,

52
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,839
she would've been a top idol by now!

53
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,039
Kira... why'd you die?

54
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,539
What's with him?

55
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,339
He's the chairman of Kira's fan club,

56
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,139
and figurine creator, Mr. Yutaka Kani.

57
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,639
Are you Kira's fan too, Mr. Yatsukawa?

58
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,039
Of course!

59
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,439
My fan club membership number is 11!

60
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,539
All the others too?

61
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,139
My name is Kazuo Honogi, membership number 8.

62
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,639
While I'm at it, I'm a doctor.

63
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,539
I'm Maho Izumi, membership number 120.

64
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,839
My number is 53.

65
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,039
I'm cameraman Ryuichi Mifune, nice to meet you!

66
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,339
What's your membership number?

67
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,839
I'm not a member.

68
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,039
He's an exclusive cameraman for a cosplay shop!

69
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,839
Cosplay shop?

70
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,539
A store in Akihabara that sells costumes for cosplay,

71
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,539
accessories and such, as well as rent them out.

72
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,239
Inside the shop, there's a corner

73
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,539
where you can take pictures of yourself wearing different costumes,

74
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,639
and I'm the one who takes the pictures.

75
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,039
Kira was originally

76
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,839
an internet idol who was in charge of the cosplay section.

77
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,139
But, the pictures of her on the website of the shop

78
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,739
and cosplay sites became popular

79
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:00,639
so she ended up debuting as a gravure idol.

80
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,739
She caught Mr. Hirasaka's eye

81
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:07,239
and was chosen as the leading actress for "The Blackmagic Girl".

82
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,439
The name of the main character in "The Blackmagic Girl"

83
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,939
was also Kira.

84
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,339
There wasn't anyone more appropriate than her for the part.

85
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,239
I can't help regretting what happened.

86
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,839
Kira.

87
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,039
Why did you end up scheduling a sence?

88
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,139
The fact is, a strange rumor has been going around

89
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,339
among the members of the fan club recently.

90
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,439
Rumor?

91
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,039
That the fans who have gone from being Kira's fan to somebody else

92
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,439
have been getting hurt or falling ill.

93
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,639
That's what they get for betraying Kira!

94
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,439
It's legit punishment for what they did!

95
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,439
On the internet,

96
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,139
there's a big fuss about it being a curse cast by Kira.

97
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,939
A curse?

98
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,839
Kira resurrected as a witch!

99
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,439
A witch?

100
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,239
The Kira in "The Blackmagic Girl" also died of an accident once

101
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,239
and then resurrected, after getting hold of the powers of a witch.

102
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,639
And she takes revenge on those

103
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,239
that made her death look to be an accident.

104
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:08,039
Kira also fell into the lake, car and all.

105
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,039
But, her body hasn't been found yet.

106
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,239
Besides, even a murder was committed.

107
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,839
Murder?

108
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,339
The editor in charge of my works was killed

109
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,939
about half a month ago.

110
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,339
What did that case have to do with Kira?

111
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,839
Mr. Sawanami who died

112
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,239
wrote with his own blood "Kira" and left a dying message.

113
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,639
Really?

114
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,539
It's true! I saw it with my own eyes.

115
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,039
You saw it?

116
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,939
She's the one who first found the body.

117
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,539
Don't tell me that

118
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:46,339
Kira, like in the comics resurrected

119
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,239
and committed the murder?

120
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,439
We can't be sure about that but...

121
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,139
That's why we decided to hold a seance

122
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,339
to summon Kira's spirit here and ask her!

123
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,239
Ridiculous.

124
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:02,939
Mr. Hirasaka has strong clairvoyant powers

125
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,239
and also has vast knowledge about the occult.

126
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:11,039
My, look at the time. Shall we start, then?

127
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,039
Let's go over to the meditation room.

128
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,639
"Meditation Room"

129
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,039
Why does it turn out this way?

130
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,639
Spirit in the dark, please answer me.

131
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:57,639
(Chanting)

132
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:14,039
Please let me hear your voice that is frozen in the dark!

133
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:22,039
(Chanting)

134
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:31,839
Kira Miyahara, answer my call!

135
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,639
(Chanting)

136
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,039
What the...

137
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,139
No!

138
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,339
Please answer my call!

139
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,639
What on earth is going on?

140
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,739
I'm suffering.

141
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,539
How vexing.

142
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:11,339
How vexing. I'm suffering.

143
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,839
It's Kira's voice!

144
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,139
I won't forgive...

145
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,039
The voice is coming from the panel!

146
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,439
I won't forgive...

147
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:25,339
The one who killed me is among you.

148
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,039
I will never ever... never forgive.

149
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,739
I shall resurrect tonight.

150
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:36,539
In order to avenge my death with my very hands!

151
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,939
No!

152
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:53,439
It's Kira's spirit! She's answered us!

153
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,439
No joke.

154
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,539
Dad, was that really the doings of a spirit just now?

155
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,939
It... it couldn't have been.

156
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:20,739
It smells like gunpowder.

157
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:21,939
What?

158
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,839
True.

159
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,039
I see, I got it!

160
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:34,539
Gunpowder was put inside the candles!

161
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,139
So that when the candles burned and became short, they would burst.

162
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,139
Are you serious?

163
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,339
There something that looks like a motor attached here.

164
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,839
What?

165
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,039
The parts for a radio controller or something have been used.

166
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,639
The stand was shaking from the motor running.

167
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,839
Which means that what happened a while ago was a hoax?

168
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,339
I guess so.

169
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,439
But, what about the things falling?

170
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,339
It's this.

171
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,039
Let's see it.

172
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,539
I see.

173
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,139
This line was hooked onto the bottom of the cups and plates to begin with.

174
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,839
Then, when the remote controller is operated, the motor rotates,

175
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,039
winding the line making the cups and dishes fall.

176
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,539
I'm sure the same kind of things are done here and there in the room!

177
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,839
You say operating a remote controller,

178
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,139
but we were all holding hands, you know?

179
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,939
Just how was it operated?

180
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,739
Pressing the button of the remote controller

181
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,839
can be done with the foot too.

182
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,939
Isn't that right, Mr. Hirasaka?

183
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,039
Mr. Honogi, he's figured it out.

184
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,439
Mr. Honogi is in this too?

185
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:53,539
We were just trying to entertain.

186
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,939
But, it's very much in bad taste.

187
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,639
Especially that voice a while ago.

188
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,239
That's...

189
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:02,139
How did you make that voice?

190
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,239
You used this, right?

191
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,539
If you attach this, everything serves as a speaker and emits sounds.

192
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,739
That's why it sounded like Kira on the panel was talking.

193
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:17,039
But, the contents of the voice were nothing like that.

194
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,639
The recorded contents were switched to something else!

195
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
Switched? By who?

196
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,139
I don't know.

197
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,239
By Kira! Because you're playing around with her spirit.

198
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,439
And, because the one who made it look like

199
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,439
she died of an accident is here!

200
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,439
Kira will resurrect tonight!

201
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,639
And, she will avenge her death!

202
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,539
Oh, it just makes me shiver!

203
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,439
Kira will resurrect.

204
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,639
There's something weird about the air in here.

205
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,639
We can use some ventilation.

206
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,518
Who on earth could've switched it?

207
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,318
Calm down.

208
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:19,118
I'm sure it's that chick!

209
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:21,318
I'll choke her and make her spit it out!

210
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,918
Wait.

211
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:26,218
Mr. Mouri is here. Not tonight.

212
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,218
Kogoro Mouri!

213
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:32,518
If he finds out about that, I'm finished!

214
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:36,718
I should've told the police back then, after all!

215
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,618
But, you...

216
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:41,018
It's amazing how you can say that.

217
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:43,818
Do you understand where you stand?

218
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:46,318
Well...

219
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:56,018
Gosh!

220
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:58,918
What a bothersome incident!

221
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:05,618
I don't know much about Kira, so will you tell me about her?

222
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:11,718
She used to patronize the cosplay shop that Mr. Mifune worked for.

223
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,518
Huh? Yeah.

224
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:15,418
Girls who come to places like that

225
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:19,718
are good at expressing their cuteness and coquettishness

226
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,518
but Kira was able to express the dark side

227
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:26,218
and fate like things that the character possessed.

228
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,918
I especially thought that she was different

229
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,218
from the others girls who like to cosplay

230
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:34,218
when I saw her cosplay "The Blackmagic Girl".

231
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,318
Kira is a goddess.

232
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:39,818
I thought that she wasn't the type to end up just doing cosplay,

233
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:42,918
so I started selling her to websites here and there.

234
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,718
And, that's when she caught the eye of a show biz production,

235
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:48,318
which lead to her gravure debut!

236
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:51,418
What about the accident that led to her death?

237
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,918
Almost a year has gone by already.

238
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,818
There was a small party here

239
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:58,818
and Kira left before everybody

240
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:00,818
because she had other things to attend to

241
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:03,818
and along the way, she lost control of her wheels

242
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:06,118
and fell into the lake.

243
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:08,518
Who was at the party?

244
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:13,118
If I remember correctly, Mr. Hirasaka, Mr. Honogi

245
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:16,918
and the editor Mr. Sawanami.

246
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,618
I think it was Mr. Swanami,

247
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:21,218
you mean the one who was killed a half a month ago?

248
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:22,318
Yes.

249
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:24,818
What kind of a case was it?

250
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:29,018
He was stabbed by someone at his condo.

251
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:33,218
And, Shoko who went to visit him found him dead.

252
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:36,518
Why did she go to the condo of that editor?

253
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:39,618
I told you that she was going to debut as a gravure model, didn't I?

254
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:42,418
She said it was to make arrangements for it.

255
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,918
But, those things are usually

256
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,918
done in the editor's division, don't you think?

257
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,218
In other words, were they going with each other?

258
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:49,518
Probably.

259
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:55,218
But, why did the victim write "Kira" as a dying message then?

260
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:56,518
I wonder.

261
00:16:56,518 --> 00:17:01,318
Would you like me to call Shoko and ask her for the details?

262
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,718
Oh no, you don't have to do that.

263
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:06,818
Oh, Shoko? This is Yatsukawa.

264
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,918
Mr. Mouri says that he wants to ask you about Mr. Sawanami.

265
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:14,718
I've got a headache.

266
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:17,618
Could I talk to him some other time?

267
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,118
Yes. See you.

268
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:27,518
She doesn't seem to be feeling too well.

269
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:31,018
We should leave the case up to the police.

270
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:35,118
Is there no chance that Kira is alive?

271
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:38,218
Her body hasn't been found yet,

272
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:42,418
but the car that was pulled out of the lake was totally destroyed.

273
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,118
Come to think of it.

274
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:45,318
What is it?

275
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:48,718
I think it's just junk rumor going through the internet,

276
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,318
but the rumor is that Kira didn't die of the car accident,

277
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:53,318
but, rather, in an accident during the party.

278
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:56,918
It goes that Mr. Hirasaka is hiding the body.

279
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,818
Hiding it, where?

280
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,918
Under the floor of the meditation room.

281
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:05,118
No.

282
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:11,518
Do you know that Kani is the one who passed that rumor around?

283
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:13,718
What? Really?

284
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,318
He used to go around like a paparazzi chasing Kira everywhere,

285
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:21,518
and found that she was always a very careful driver.

286
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,318
So that she would never get herself into that kind of an accident.

287
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:30,818
Kira will resurrect soon.

288
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:48,118
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

289
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:51,818
Excuse me.

290
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:56,118
I'm sorry for intruding on you at this hour of the day.

291
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,818
What seems to be the matter?

292
00:18:57,818 --> 00:19:00,018
Shoko is not in her room.

293
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:01,818
Shoko's not?

294
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,318
Since she said she wasn't feeling well,

295
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:07,218
I went to her room to check on her after that

296
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:08,618
but, she wasn't there.

297
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:11,218
And she hasn't been back since.

298
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:14,218
Her cell phone is also switched off.

299
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:18,118
From Shoko?

300
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:19,518
This is...

301
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:21,918
"I have returned to life, Kira"

302
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,818
I just got a strange mail.

303
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,318
"I have returned to life, Kira"

304
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:32,518
Ran, please wake Pops up!

305
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:33,918
Let's look for Shoko!

306
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,018
Okay!

307
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,718
Who is it?

308
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,618
Mr. Kani. What're you doing?

309
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:52,018
Kira resurrected!

310
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:56,618
I'm sure she's in here! It's locked and won't open!

311
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:59,318
Did you receive mail too, Mr. Kani?

312
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:02,918
Kira, open up!

313
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,818
The door is locked.

314
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:13,318
But that door was locked with a padlock from the outside

315
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,718
by Mr. Hirasaka after the seance, wasn't it?

316
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:18,718
But, it's locked from the inside now!

317
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,618
Who's in there? Please answer!

318
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:24,718
Kira!

319
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,518
What on earth is the matter?

320
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,318
I got a strange mail from Shoko.

321
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:32,418
You got one too, Mr. Mifune?

322
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,918
Shoko wasn't in her room, so I came here looking for her,

323
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,618
then I found this door locked.

324
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:39,518
What? You mean Shoko is inside, then?

325
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,318
Maho, can you call Shoko on your cell?

326
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,318
Okay.

327
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,418
It's calling.

328
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,118
I don't hear the ringtone, though.

329
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,418
Let's crack the glass over there and unlock the door!

330
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,518
No, but...

331
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:01,918
Maybe she's not feeling well and collapsed!

332
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,718
We've got no choice, let's do it!

333
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:14,718
It's locked with a padlock!

334
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:33,618
What on earth...

335
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,818
Shoko!

336
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,618
No joke!

337
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:55,218
Kira has resurrected?

338
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:02,918
The entrance door was locked from the inside with a padlock.

339
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:04,818
The only window is over there.

340
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:07,218
It's possible to go through a window that size

341
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:09,618
but how would you climb up there?

342
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:12,718
Rather, if I remember correctly, that window...

343
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:15,818
unless you keep on pushing the switch, it'll stop.

344
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:18,518
It cannot be closed from the outside.

345
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:20,818
A locked room murder.

346
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:26,118
How did the culprit who killed Shoko escape from this room?

347
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:34,618
She's resurrected! Kira's resurrected!

348
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:37,918
It's the birth of the The Blackmagic Girl!

349
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,460
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
"Poster"
