1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,985
So that person who requested you to investigate

2
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:07,987
whether her boyfriend was cheating on her.

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,029
Yeah. She passed away.

4
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:13,429
She fell down a flight of stone stairs.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,529
"Kaoru Mizumori (24), deceased" -Tsuge! You've got the nerve!

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,329
Huh? What're you talking about?

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,629
Don't play dumb with me!

8
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:22,529
"Takashi Sasamori(28)" -You intended to have a little fun, right?

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,529
And Kaoru who pressed you to marry her got in your way,

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,429
"Hikari Tsuga (33)" -so you pushed her down the stairs!

11
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,329
What a stupid thing to say.

12
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,029
I saw you at the top of the stone stairs from where Kaoru fell!

13
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,429
Wait. Please stop!

14
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,829
"Mariko Noguchi (30)" -That matter was thoroughly

15
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,629
investigated by the police and the misunderstanding was solved!

16
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:42,829
Silence!

17
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,929
The police may have been fooled, but not me!

18
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,025
Please stop!

19
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,229
Please stop it, both of you!

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,429
"Kazumi Ishikura (25)" -Please don't talk that way in front of Kaoru.

21
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,929
Let her rest in peace, please.

22
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,329
That young lady is right.

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,829
You should keep in mind where you are.

24
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,329
No matter how much you detest me,

25
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,129
I'm not the killer.

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,729
Excuse me.

27
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,029
Wait, Mr. Tsuge.

28
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,546
That was 3 months ago.

29
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:14,053
Then, this morning Mr. Tsuge suddenly calls you and says,

30
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:18,662
"I'll tell you about the killer back then, so please come."

31
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,059
Yeah.

32
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:25,662
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

33
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,862
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

34
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,562
What was the real purpose of the artist

35
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:31,462
behind the queer artifact?

36
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:33,062
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:35,062
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,562
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,120
"Message from a Client"

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,191
Did something happen?

41
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,720
Yes, there was a landslide ahead.

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,197
This road is inaccessible.

43
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,720
Is that right?

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,720
We're on our way to that house over there.

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
You are, too.

46
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,207
In that case, that road is fine.

47
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,920
Thanks.

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,820
Darn it. I can barely see ahead.

49
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,217
Can you handle? Be careful, Dad.

50
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,720
Is anyone else coming?

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah, he said he also called the three people

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,820
who made a commotion at the funeral.

53
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,235
There are people here before us, as expected.

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,247
Mr. Mouri, you were called over by Tsuge too?

55
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,720
Yes.

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,020
What heavy rain.

57
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,920
Come, let's go inside.

58
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,720
Whose car is this?

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
It's Tsuge's car.

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,720
He's been cooped up in this atelier for the past three months

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,320
working on his artwork.

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,275
Oh, no. The door's not locked.

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,020
Mr. Tsuge, it's me, Noguchi.

64
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,220
-Here. -Thank you.

65
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,287
I forgot my umbrella.

66
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,720
Thank you.

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Not at all.

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,293
You'd better hurry and dry yourself up.

69
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,920
Mr. Tsuge!

70
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,820
It's too late.

71
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,120
Ran! Call the police!

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,020
Yes!

73
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,920
I will preserve the scene,

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,720
so please leave the room, everyone!

75
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Wait.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,220
Please don't touch the artifact no matter what.

77
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,820
Huh? Artifact?

78
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,720
It's just junk put together.

79
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,820
Is there any meaning to that stuff?

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,720
How rude!

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Are you making fun of Mr. Tsuge's artwork?

82
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Okay, okay.

83
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,120
Anyway, I'll inform the police about it,

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,020
so please leave this room for now.

85
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,320
Really? I'm really counting on you, all right?

86
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,220
Yes, yes, I got it.

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,120
What's this?

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,420
There's no dust only on top of the tape.

89
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,120
Which means, there was something on it till just a while ago.

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,920
Is that a screen?

91
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,520
"Demurrer"...

92
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,367
If I remember correctly, it means "objection" or something to that effect.

93
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,369
Hey, you!

94
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,371
Don't wander around on your own!

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,373
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,420
I wonder what on earth was there.

97
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,383
And who moved it.

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,389
There's nothing inside this room that's a likely object.

99
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,020
Which means that the culprit took it outside, after all.

100
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,120
The victim is Hikari Tsuge.

101
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,399
His real name is Ritsu Hikage, 33 years old.

102
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,820
His profession is a sculptor.

103
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,220
By the way, it seems that Hikari Tsuge is

104
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,020
an anagram of Ritsu Hikage, his real name.

105
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,720
An anagram, you mean like

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,320
when the characters are rearranged to make a different word?

107
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,220
Yes. The cause of death was

108
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,820
an occipital blow leading to intracranial injury.

109
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,419
The hammer which is thought to be the murder weapon

110
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,220
was found on the floor nearby,

111
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,423
but the fingerprints were all wiped clean.

112
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,920
I'd like to ask you again.

113
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,320
You were all told by the victim that he would tell you

114
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,520
who the culprit that committed the crime 3 months ago was

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,420
and invited you all here, correct?

116
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,020
Yes, Inspector.

117
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,720
However, when we got here,

118
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,441
he was already dead and the culprit had fled.

119
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,320
About that, Mr. Mouri...

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,520
According to the officer at the checkpoint,

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,220
no one had gone down the road that leads out of the atelier.

122
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Which means that the culprit is still somewhere nearby?

123
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,820
That's very likely.

124
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,020
No, there were only 4 cars to begin with that didn't make a U-turn

125
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,720
and came up the slope, the officer said.

126
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,020
Only 4 cars?

127
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,020
Me, and Kazumi, Mr. Sasamori, Mr. Mouri and his party.

128
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,920
Which means that the culprit is among us.

129
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,120
I see. There's only one road coming up here,

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
and there's a checkpoint up ahead.

131
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,820
Fleeing down the dark slope in this rain is impossible.

132
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
It's indeed a closed circle.

133
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,620
No, that can't be!

134
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,520
Because we were the first to get here,

135
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,920
and everybody else came after us.

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,499
Right! I was up front.

137
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,520
And behind him was me.

138
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,503
Then lastly, Ms. Noguchi.

139
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:49,320
We entered the atelier together and found the body.

140
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,509
I see.

141
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,120
But when we told the officer

142
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,515
that we were coming to this atelier,

143
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,420
the officer said, "You are, too."

144
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,020
Doesn't that mean that there was another car

145
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,220
that came to the atelier before us?

146
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,820
If we ask that officer about the model of the car or the driver,

147
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,520
maybe we'll find out about the culprit?

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,120
The thing is, he says he remembers that there were 4 cars,

149
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
but he doesn't remember the model of the cars

150
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,520
or the face of the drivers.

151
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,020
How would I be able to tell about things like that in this downpour?

152
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,120
Come on, mister.

153
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,020
Okay, so if we organize what's been said, is this it.

154
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,220
There was one car here already at the atelier.

155
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,553
This was the car of Mr. Tsuge who was killed.

156
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,420
Then, Mouri and his group arrived.

157
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,559
After that, 3 cars came successively. That makes 4 cars.

158
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,561
However, according to the officer,

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,620
a car went by before the one Conan was in.

160
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,420
Which means that...

161
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,820
The car of the culprit arrived first.

162
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,720
Then, after killing Mr. Tsuge,

163
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,575
the culprit left the atelier, hid somewhere,

164
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,577
waited for everyone to arrive

165
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,320
and joined everyone as if nothing had happened.

166
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,581
Is that it?

167
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,120
What is the motive for the crime, then?

168
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,220
Of course to shut him up.

169
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,589
Hearing that Mr. Tsuge would reveal

170
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,593
who killed Kaoru Sasamori 3 months ago,

171
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,595
the culprit came to the atelier before everyone else,

172
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,920
and killed Mr. Tsuge.

173
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,520
In other words, the culprit for this case,

174
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,603
is also the one who killed Ms. Kaoru Sasamori!

175
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,920
And that person is...

176
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,020
One of you three!

177
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,520
Really cool!

178
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Anyone could see that considering the circumstances.

179
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,620
The problem is to figure out who of the three is the culprit.

180
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,128
Hold it.

181
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:02,228
Let's say the culprit is one among the three of us.

182
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,928
Would Tsuge who knew that,

183
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,328
go out of his way to call the culprit over?

184
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:09,528
Maybe he wanted to pretend being a detective?

185
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,928
He had a childish side to him, you know.

186
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:14,428
True.

187
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:17,228
He probably went out of his way to call everyone over

188
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,328
because he wanted to say, "The culprit is among you!"

189
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,328
Don't you think?

190
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:22,661
It's just like what he would think up.

191
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:25,528
Well, I'm not the one who did it.

192
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:29,528
I had a date for a meal with my younger sister that day.

193
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:32,128
But shooting the film ran late,

194
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:34,673
so I went to meet her where she was waiting, a bit late.

195
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:40,161
Kaoru!

196
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:42,681
Are you all right, Kaoru?

197
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,962
Somebody pushed me from behind.

198
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:47,562
Were you pushed down?

199
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:50,689
Back then, I saw

200
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,691
Tsuge at the top of the stone stairs.

201
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:58,062
So, I thought that Tsuge was the culprit.

202
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:00,262
But it wasn't so.

203
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,462
Mr. Tsuge was a witness to the crime.

204
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:06,262
That's why I could never be the culprit.

205
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:09,962
But you don't have any witness, do you?

206
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,362
Then, are you saying that I'm lying?

207
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,362
Kaoru is my younger sister, you know!

208
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:17,862
But you didn't get along with her, did you?

209
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,062
I heard from Kaoru

210
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:21,762
that she was on bad terms with her older brother

211
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,062
over the estate left behind by her parents.

212
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:25,862
She told you about that, too.

213
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,962
So, angered at her,

214
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:31,062
you pushed her from the stone stairs, didn't you?

215
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,731
What did you say?

216
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,062
Hold it, Kazumi.

217
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:38,161
You sure sound like a lady worried over her best friend,

218
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:41,862
but you also have a motive for wanting to kill Kaoru, don't you?

219
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,743
Just what do you mean?

220
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:48,362
Tsuge had another woman besides Kaoru.

221
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:49,362
What?

222
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:55,062
She hired Mr. Mouri here to find out who that woman was.

223
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:57,362
That's right.

224
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:01,161
Then, who's that other woman?

225
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:03,862
Right, it's Ms. Kazumi Ishikura.

226
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,862
I didn't know either.

227
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:10,362
That he was also going out with Kaoru.

228
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:15,062
What?

229
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,962
I was proposed by Mr. Tsuge!

230
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,161
What shall I do?

231
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,762
What's this?

232
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,785
What does this mean, Mr. Tsuge?

233
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:30,789
I'm talking about work, so we'll talk about it later.

234
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,562
Since when have you been going out with Kaoru?

235
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,762
-It's not what you think! -Don't take me lightly!

236
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:39,362
Break up with her! Break up with Kaoru!

237
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:43,862
It's not that you don't have a motive, either, is it?

238
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:45,462
What?

239
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,362
I heard from Kaoru.

240
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,661
Kaoru, this.

241
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,562
What's this?

242
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,562
There's 1,000,000 yen inside.

243
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,661
I want you to break up with Tsuge.

244
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:56,815
Oh, no.

245
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,817
Ever since he started going out with you,

246
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:01,262
Tsuge's stopped working.

247
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:02,821
So, take this and break up with him.

248
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,262
I'm leaving!

249
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,562
I heard that the clients were looking for other artists

250
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:12,831
because Tsuge virtually didn't work.

251
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
If so, you would have to pay an exorbitant penalty fee

252
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,262
for breach of contract.

253
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:19,862
And that's why you're saying that I killed Kaoru?

254
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:22,161
It's true that since she passed away,

255
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,562
Tsuge was obsessed in making artwork.

256
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,862
But that has nothing to do with me!

257
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,462
Hey, Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:38,262
What is it, Conan?

259
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,859
Pops Kogoro asked me to tell you something.

260
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,462
He said he wanted you to look for a place

261
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:47,262
from the checkpoint to here where a car could be hidden.

262
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,661
Okay.

263
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,962
Maybe around here?

264
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:01,862
I'll go take a look.

265
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:03,862
Conan!

266
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,883
It's true.

267
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,262
If here, the car that comes up from the slope

268
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,362
won't be able to see anything

269
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:08,462
because the hut over there will block the view.

270
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:10,889
Which means...

271
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,661
So, this is it.

272
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,762
This is what the culprit took away from the scene of the crime.

273
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:18,897
If so, that was...

274
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,161
Then, everyone.

275
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:26,062
I would like to ask each one of you some more questions

276
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,907
so please come with me to the station.

277
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:34,661
-Dad? -It's come! Sleeping Kogoro!

278
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:36,915
There's no need to go to the station,

279
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:39,862
Inspector, I shall settle the case here and now.

280
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,262
What?

281
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:45,562
When I found Mr. Tsuge's body in this atelier,

282
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:48,462
I found that the trace of something had disappeared.

283
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,562
-Something? -Judging from the circumstances,

284
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:54,161
it's probably something that the culprit took away

285
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,661
after committing the crime.

286
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:57,661
Takagi, bring it, will you?

287
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:59,262
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:03,362
Why did Mr. Tsuge, already 3 months after the incident,

289
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,862
say that he would reveal who the killer of that incident was?

290
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:12,161
On the day of Kaoru's funeral, he could've revealed it

291
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:14,661
when he got into an argument with Mr. Sasamori, couldn't he?

292
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,462
That's true.

293
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:19,362
Mr. Tsuge probably wanted to accuse the culprit

294
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,962
in his own unique way.

295
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:25,762
In order to do so, he needed 3 months.

296
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:27,562
Could that be...

297
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:28,762
Right.

298
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:30,762
It's the time he needed to make that artifact

299
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:33,262
that you see in front of you.

300
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,862
The title of that artifact is "demurrer".

301
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,862
It means "objection."

302
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,661
Mr. Mouri, here it is.

303
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,462
I'm sorry, but can you put that in the place

304
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,983
where the vinyl tape is in the room?

305
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,762
Yes, sir.

306
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,562
Try to remember.

307
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:50,462
The name Hikaru Tsuge is

308
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,661
the anagram of his real name, Ritsu Hikage.

309
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:56,161
Hikari (Light) Tsuge and Ritsu Hikage (Shadow).

310
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,262
Indeed "light" and "shadow".

311
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:00,762
And I tried figuring out the anagram for "demurrer",

312
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:03,562
the title of the artifact.

313
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:07,362
A different title emerges...

314
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:08,762
"Murderer".

315
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:12,362
The hidden title "murderer".

316
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:16,661
The hidden title "Murderer"?

317
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,562
It's ready.

318
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:22,562
Ran, please lower the screen above the door

319
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:24,161
and turn off the light of the room.

320
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,661
Okay.

321
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:30,262
Takagi, the light.

322
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:31,862
Yes, sir.

323
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:37,462
What about this is the murderer?

324
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:41,462
Takagi, turn the pedestal of the artifact slowly, will you?

325
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:43,962
Huh? Yes, sir.

326
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:49,362
This is...

327
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,051
Shadow art.

328
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,662
At first glance, it's an artifact that's incomprehensible.

329
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:58,762
But if you shine the light on it from a certain angle,

330
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:00,662
a shadow art emerges from it.

331
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,462
Through his art,

332
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:07,362
Mr. Tsuge was trying to accuse the culprit.

333
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,362
Ran, turn on the light.

334
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:12,762
Ms. Kazumi Ishikura.

335
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:16,062
You're the one who killed Ms. Kaoru Sasamori

336
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,077
and Mr. Hikari Tsuge, aren't you?

337
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,079
Hold it, Mr. Mouri.

338
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,081
I wonder if that silhouetted ballerina artifact

339
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,462
suffices to accuse her as the culprit.

340
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:27,562
True, that the silhouetted picture alone

341
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,662
may not suffice as evidence.

342
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:33,562
But the culprit afraid that the picture would be shown

343
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,962
took the light away from the scene.

344
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,462
That move of hers,

345
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:41,099
serves as an immovable evidence that specifies her as the culprit.

346
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,101
Try to remember.

347
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,662
In order to go to where the light was,

348
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:47,862
you would have to step over Mr. Tsuge's dead body.

349
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,362
However, on the other side, there was a pool of blood,

350
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,762
and you can't step on it.

351
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:55,762
Because you'd be leaving footprints if you did.

352
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:57,962
In other words, the culprit, just as Conan did,

353
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,662
at the time the body was found,

354
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:02,862
went under the work table and went over to the other side,

355
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,462
and took the light away.

356
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:09,127
No offense but with the physique of Mr. Sasamori or Ms. Noguch,

357
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,662
it would be impossible to go under the work table.

358
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,133
The only one who can go through there

359
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,462
is you, a ballerina, Ms. Ishikura.

360
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,462
Lastly, one more thing.

361
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:23,862
When you got off your car at the parking lot,

362
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,145
you didn't have an umbrella and were soaking wet, weren't you?

363
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,462
However, from what Conan tells me,

364
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:33,862
the driver's seat of your car was also soaking wet.

365
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:34,862
In other words,

366
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:38,362
you were already drenched before you got off your car

367
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:42,062
because you went to get rid of that light stand in this rain.

368
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:48,362
We were supposed to get married.

369
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:51,562
At least, I thought so.

370
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:54,162
That's why when I heard he invited you,

371
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,662
I thought he was going to announce that.

372
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,462
So, not being able to wait that long, I came here before all of you.

373
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:03,662
Tsuge had the nerve to show me his shadow art

374
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,662
and told me he was going to accuse me of murder.

375
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,262
What are you talking about?

376
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:11,189
Weren't you going to announce our engagement today?

377
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,762
You said that if Kaoru disappeared,

378
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,193
you'd be able to marry me!

379
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:17,562
I said that on the spur of the moment

380
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,197
because I was fed up that she hired a detective

381
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,362
and was snooping around.

382
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,362
You were dumb enough to take it seriously.

383
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:26,762
I had no idea that you would actually go through with it.

384
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:28,962
I mean, she was your best friend, you know.

385
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:36,662
Kaoru!

386
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:39,217
Are you all right, Kaoru?

387
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,219
I really want out now.

388
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:47,225
I advise you to turn yourself in.

389
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,562
I called a detective called Kogoro Mouri over

390
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,662
so that you could do so, too.

391
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:54,862
I'm sure he'll take you to the police.

392
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:57,562
If you need one, I can get you a good lawyer, too.

393
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:18,662
But...

394
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:21,962
But, why didn't you destroy his artifact?

395
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:25,062
If you did, you wouldn't have had to hide the light.

396
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,062
It's not that she didn't destroy it.

397
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,269
She couldn't.

398
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,862
Right. I couldn't destroy it.

399
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:37,562
I was happy.

400
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:41,562
Even if it were a piece that he made so that he could accuse me,

401
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:45,062
just to think that he thought about me for 3 months

402
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:48,662
while he was making this artifact,

403
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,662
I just couldn't destroy it.

404
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:20,562
Hey, Dad!

405
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:23,381
You're drinking too much beer!

406
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,383
Besides, why are the lights turned off?

407
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:29,062
Shut up! Just wait and see.

408
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:33,062
I'm going to show you my artistic shadow art from now.

409
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:36,862
No joke!

410
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:40,262
Fantastic! It's Mom's profile!

411
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,562
It... It sure looks it.

412
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:46,177
Dad, you had artistic talent too, didn't you?

413
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:48,695
Sort of.

414
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:51,695
Call me "Art Kogoro" from now on!

415
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:58,095
Right. Kogoro Mouri Art... What a surprise.

416
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,417
What the?

417
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,423
"Candy"

419
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,425
-Dad's cold case, huh? -Who's Dad?

420
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:10,560
I meant "dandy". Dandy.
