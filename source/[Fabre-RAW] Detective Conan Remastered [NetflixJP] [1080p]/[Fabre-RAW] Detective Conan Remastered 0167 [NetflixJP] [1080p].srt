1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,110
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,810
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,710
The case at the "spider mansion" becomes more complicated.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,710
Ran and Kazuha are in a danger situation.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,210
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,310
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,110
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,650
We were called out to the Takeda's home

9
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,050
at Trick Ridge in Tottori Prefecture.

10
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,650
Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama

11
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,150
get lost in the forest

12
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,250
and meet up with an American by the name of Robert Taylor.

13
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,650
We happen to pass by and find out that

14
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,250
we had all been called out to the Takeda home

15
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,450
to solve the mystery of the curse at the "spider mansion".

16
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,250
On the night we arrive,

17
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,750
the eldest son of the Takeda family,

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,050
Nobukazu, commits suicide on the second floor of the doll storehouse.

19
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,050
Furthermore, someone suspicious appears behind Kazuha...

20
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,150
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 2)"

21
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,050
I'm sorry!

22
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,450
Kazuha! I've found the mascot I was looking for!

23
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,150
It was caught on the cover of the CD player.

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,350
Huh?

25
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,650
Kazuha? Where are you?

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,750
Kazuha's penlight.

27
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,250
Kazuha.

28
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,950
Kazuha?

29
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,550
Kazuha!

30
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,750
Hey, look at this!

31
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,050
Looks like he's been hit on the back of the head with something.

32
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,550
What?

33
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,850
Then, the murderer hit him and then...

34
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,850
The time of death is about 9pm.

35
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,150
Just around the time Nobukazu left the living room.

36
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,150
At that time,

37
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,450
he had already been called out by the murderer.

38
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,250
And, the murderer met Nobukazu here, hit him on the head

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,150
put him unconscious. Then, strung him up by the neck.

40
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,250
That's right!

41
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,350
He wrapped a lot of string around the body

42
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,850
to make it look like the curse of the Spider Empress.

43
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,550
But, I don't understand.

44
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,950
How did the murderer

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,650
escape from the room after he committed the crime?

46
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,450
Nobukazu's sandals and flashlight

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,250
scattered on the floor also bothers me.

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,850
It's also strange that there's no dust on the shelves and floor.

49
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,450
The room was supposed to have been left alone for three years.

50
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,950
Hey, kid.

51
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,450
Oh, that small window.

52
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,650
A child can barely fit through it,

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,250
but is there something to it?

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,150
A reason why it had to be left open...

55
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,750
No. I thought I heard

56
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,250
Ran's voice outside the window.

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,250
-Huh? -And, Kazuha's voice too.

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,550
Idiot!

59
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,650
Those two are probably in their room fast asleep.

60
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,750
Hey! What was that sound?

61
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,450
The stairs.

62
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,350
Someone's coming up the stairs.

63
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,350
Heavy feet... It's not Ran.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,350
Who'd be coming here?

65
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,150
Never mind.

66
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,750
Let's meet him in person

67
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,050
and ask him what the reason is!

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,750
Good grief... it's the housekeeper.

69
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,850
What's the matter?

70
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,450
I thought you'd be hungry,

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,450
so I brought you some rice balls and tea.

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,450
Oh, this looks delicious.

73
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,350
Kazuha! Are you here?

74
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,750
Answer me if you're here.

75
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,350
Kazuha!

76
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,650
Misa Takeda who died three years ago, you knew her.

77
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,850
Yes, we were nurses at the same hospital

78
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,450
but, the work was too hard for me and I quit.

79
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,950
I became a housekeeper here through Misa's introduction.

80
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,450
Thank you.

81
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,550
Misa was a really a nice girl,

82
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,250
always alert and kind.

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,250
But... why?

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,250
Why does a person like that have to commit suicide?

85
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,550
Just maybe... that could be the reason.

86
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,350
Misa's father, Nobukazu,

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
came home from the hospital for some reason,

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,200
he grabbed his wife, Kinuyo, and was in great anger.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,900
He said, "You really deceived me for the past 20 years!"

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,900
Deceived him... about what?

91
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,500
Well... I have no idea.

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,000
And, that's when Misa got badly hurt.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Badly hurt?

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes. Misa went between them to stop the fight,

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
but Nobukazu pushed her aside.

96
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
She hit her head on a pillar

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,400
and had to have 7 stitches on her forehead.

98
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,100
Misa became gloomy

99
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,800
and rested from work at the hospital

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
until she met Robert.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Robert?

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
The day of a landslide, three years ago...

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Misa accidentally found him.

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,500
He was caught in a landslide while taking photos

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
and was badly hurt.

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Unfortunately, the hospital rooms were filled that day.

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,900
Misa had no choice, so she had him treated at the hospital

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,700
and brought him here and took care of him.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,000
In the beginning, she had a hard time taking care of him.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,700
The inside of Robert's mouth was cut-up with the landslide

111
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,500
and he couldn't speak well.

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Robert could speak Japanese,

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
but it seems he couldn't read or write it

114
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
and the conversation with Misa

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,000
took place on paper with Roman letters.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,300
But, when Robert got better and was able to talk,

117
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,500
they seem to be enjoying things.

118
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,300
They told all sorts of jokes.

119
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,700
"Japanese foods are delicious,

120
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,100
especially on rainy days, dirt and sand are excellent"

121
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,700
or "I'm a prince of a certain country,

122
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,800
and I came to find a bride who is like a light".

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,300
By the time Robert's wounds had healed

124
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,200
and a farewell party was to be held,

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,900
Ryuji and his family were home

126
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,500
and he became friends with them too.

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,400
Misa also became bright again.

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
But, that makes it more confusing.

129
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,200
Wasn't it two to three days after Robert went home,

130
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,600
that Misa committed suicide?

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,300
I don't really know,

132
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,700
but after Robert went home, Misa became gloomy again.

133
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,100
She suddenly disappeared

134
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,300
and everyone thought she ran away from home.

135
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,200
Yuzo is the one who found Misa dead

136
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,500
on the second floor of the storehouse.

137
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,400
And, several days later,

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,700
her mother, Kinuyo, also committed suicide in the storehouse.

139
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
After the two died,

140
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,200
was there anybody who had a change in attitude?

141
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Well...

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,700
Nobukazu came to the funeral without tears or sad expression,

143
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,800
but on the other hand, Ryuji was the one who was a big problem.

144
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,400
He cried in a voice so loud it echoed

145
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,700
throughout the neighborhood.

146
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,800
The other would be Sae and Emi.

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh, those twins.

148
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,500
Those two were such good friends with Robert, but...

149
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,000
2 years ago, when they came back to visit,

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,500
they suddenly started saying something strange.

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
It was Robert.

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,100
Robert is the one who killed Misa.

153
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,400
Isn't it terrible?

154
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,700
Terrible...

155
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,700
But, why did the children say something like that?

156
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,100
I don't know.

157
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Mr. Negishi who came to pick up the dolls

158
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
was also surprised

159
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,200
because after they talked to him,

160
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
they suddenly started saying those things.

161
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,400
What did they talk about?

162
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Well...

163
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,800
Mr. Negishi said they only asked him his name.

164
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,000
That's the Mr. Negishi who died in the barn the other day.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Everyone was at the neighborhood gathering.

166
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,400
Yoko came home ahead of the others to prepare dinner

167
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,700
and found him in the barn.

168
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,500
At that time, weren't you around?

169
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,800
Nobukazu and I were at the supermarket

170
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,500
buying the ingredients for dinner.

171
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
With Nobukazu?

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
Yes.

173
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
After his wife died,

174
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Nobukazu took control of the household money.

175
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,500
By the way, the rope used to hang Nobukazu

176
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
and the string around him...

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,600
can they be found in this storehouse?

178
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Yes, if it's the string, there's a lot of it

179
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
because it's used to make the marionettes.

180
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
But, the ropes are in the barn.

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Would you like to go and see them?

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,800
It's raining hard.

183
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,100
Hey, Kudo. Do you know who it is? The murderer?

184
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,700
Nope... not who the murderer is or the sealed room trick...

185
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,400
not a single lead.

186
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,700
After Nobukazu left the living room,

187
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,400
Robert went to the barn to get the car

188
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
and left with Ran and Kazuha,

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
he didn't go near the storehouse even once.

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,700
It's impossible to be him.

191
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,000
Yoko, who was in the bath with the twins,

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,100
the housekeeper who was cleaning up in the living room with us

193
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,900
and the old lady who was in her room are also clean.

194
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,800
The ones that could have done anything are

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,500
Ryuji, the one making the bath and...

196
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Yuzo, who was looking all over the house for Nobukazu.

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,700
Those two...

198
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,500
But, something bugs me...

199
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,400
something...

200
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,900
The string, isn't it?

201
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
Right, right... that's it!

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,300
Why did the murderer have to use the string

203
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,000
to make it look a curse?

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,900
It was a sealed room.

205
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,600
If he didn't do a thing like that,

206
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,300
we would have thought it was a suicide.

207
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,600
And that request letter that was sent to you

208
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
also bothers me.

209
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,900
If that was sent by the murderer,

210
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,600
is he taking me lightly and putting up a challenge?

211
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
This case...

212
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,200
something fishy is running behind it.

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,300
Let's see... the rope is...

214
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,400
Is somebody there?

215
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,500
Ran?

216
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,400
What's that? Kazuha is missing?

217
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,700
Is she really?

218
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Only her penlight was on the ground.

219
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,900
When I thought someone carried her off, I panicked...

220
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,500
Anyway, let's split up and search for her!

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Kazuha! Where are you?

222
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Hey!

223
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Kazuha!

224
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Hey! Have you found her?

225
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Nope, she's nowhere...

226
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
What's the matter? Hattori?

227
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,300
The door to the storehouse.

228
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,400
I thought I closed it but, it's open.

229
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,800
This is...

230
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Ka...

231
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,100
Kazuha!

232
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,790
Kazuha!

233
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,690
Hey! Get a hold of yourself, Kazuha!

234
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,590
Kazuha...

235
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,190
Heiji...

236
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,390
Kazuha!

237
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,990
What happened to me?

238
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,290
If I'm not mistaken...

239
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,890
I was waiting for Ran in front of the storehouse, but...

240
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,890
I suddenly felt faint.

241
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,390
Be quiet! I'll cut you loose right now.

242
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,290
Kazuha!

243
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,390
You don't have to worry.

244
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,790
Looks like you were just hanging with the strings.

245
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,590
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Kazuha!

246
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,890
I didn't search hard enough,

247
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,890
and got you into this terrible situation.

248
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,990
Then the mascot?

249
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,090
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,190
I found it, it was caught in the cover of the CD player.

251
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,690
I'm really sorry... if I had taken a closer look...

252
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,790
I'm glad you found it...

253
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,090
Don't lose it again.

254
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,990
Hey, Hattori.

255
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,090
I know!

256
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,390
Old man! Please take care of Kazuha!

257
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,290
Huh?

258
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,590
What?

259
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,190
Don't you see?

260
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,090
He tried to use our blind-spot by hanging Kazuha up

261
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,290
in the storehouse we were in a while ago.

262
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,590
After we left, he brought Kazuha here

263
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,490
and wrapped her in the strings...

264
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,490
there all he had to do was put that rope around her neck

265
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,290
and the curse would be completed.

266
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,290
There's only one reason why he had to stop.

267
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,490
The murderer noticed my footsteps when I ran over here,

268
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,590
and he left in a hurry.

269
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,090
Which means...

270
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,290
The murderer is still in this storehouse.

271
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,890
Hey, Kudo! Are my deductions wrong?

272
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,790
No, nothing's wrong!

273
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,790
Then, let's have a look at the murderer's face.

274
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,090
Hey, is he around?

275
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,290
Nope.

276
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,990
That's strange,

277
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,590
it hasn't been 3 minutes since we came to this storehouse.

278
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,190
We were guarding the entrance on the first floor

279
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,690
and there's no place to hide.

280
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,990
The only place to escape from would be that tiny window.

281
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,890
Is it really possible?

282
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,390
Is there a way to get out from there in such a short time?

283
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,990
What? This time that girl from Osaka was attacked?

284
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,090
By who?

285
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,890
I don't know.

286
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,190
Kazuha is resting in the room right now,

287
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,190
but she may remember in time...

288
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,490
one of the faces among you.

289
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,390
One reason we had you gather here

290
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,190
is to prevent anymore murders from taking place

291
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,190
and the other is to confirm your alibis.

292
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,190
Alibis?

293
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,290
We were asleep in our rooms all this time.

294
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,690
It's the same for me.

295
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,290
I was in my room too, but I wasn't asleep.

296
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,690
Where were you?

297
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,990
I didn't see you when we were searching.

298
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,490
I was searching outside the house.

299
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,990
In other words, everyone doesn't have an alibi.

300
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,890
You're kidding.

301
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,990
Yuzo isn't around?

302
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,090
Oh, if it's Yuzo, wouldn't he be in the workshop?

303
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,290
Oh, me?

304
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,990
I was here working all the time.

305
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,990
I was putting the finishing touches on the doll

306
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,190
that brother had to complete by tomorrow.

307
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,090
You can make dolls too.

308
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,990
Three years ago, my company went bankrupt

309
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,590
and I came back home.

310
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,790
Brother taught me all sorts of things

311
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:31,490
and let me do the simple constructions.

312
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,090
Three years ago...

313
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,690
that's the time of that incident.

314
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,690
Yes, I came home just after Robert had left.

315
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:45,590
But, I wasn't allowed to make fixtures or do repairs.

316
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,990
Brother's marionettes cost $10,000 a piece

317
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,090
and he charged $7,000 for repairs.

318
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,590
He sold them for $10,000 and repaired them for $7,000?

319
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,290
Can he do business like that?

320
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,390
Yes, seems like there are some people

321
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,090
who request repairs more than 10 times.

322
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:09,290
He charged quite a bit for the marionettes.

323
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,390
With the money he saved,

324
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,590
he often went abroad with Mr. Negishi to play.

325
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,890
After leaving the sales of the dolls to Mr. Negishi,

326
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,790
they began to sell at high prices.

327
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,090
What's that big doll?

328
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,990
Oh, that's the marionette of the Spider Empress.

329
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,590
When Father was alive, dolls of that size

330
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,590
were used at every festival to do plays of the Spider Empress,

331
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,290
but the number of people able to handle dolls that big

332
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,090
gradually disappeared and they quit doing it.

333
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,390
What are those boxes that are stacked up?

334
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,690
Oh, it's the dolls that Mr. Negishi

335
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,590
was suppose to take that day.

336
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,490
After Mr. Negishi died,

337
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,590
brother realized that he was one doll short.

338
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,290
The customer called directly

339
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,790
and he had to make one more.

340
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,790
Anyway, please stay in the room everyone is gathered in.

341
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,890
It's dangerous to be by yourself.

342
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,190
Sure.

343
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,990
All right, now's our chance.

344
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,790
The repair fees for the dolls are extremely high.

345
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,290
Despite the price, there are customer

346
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,790
who request repairs more than 10 times.

347
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,290
A simple puppet that's expensive means...

348
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,890
What's inside is probably...

349
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,490
narcotics.

350
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,590
As for the marionettes...

351
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,090
you can only put the narcotics in the head,

352
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,790
so the price is cheaper.

353
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,190
I've got it.

354
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,290
Now I know the reason why Nobukazu called a detective

355
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,540
to find out who the murderer is.

356
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,440
A large part of the entire picture has come into view.

357
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,040
What's left that we don't know is the sealed-room trick

358
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,540
and why Kazuha had to be attacked.

359
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,840
Sae!

360
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,140
Emi!

361
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,240
What is it? What's the matter?

362
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,940
The two daughters I brought to the restroom aren't here.

363
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,440
What's that?

364
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,340
Mother.

365
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,340
You worried me.

366
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,540
Didn't I tell you to wait in front of the restroom

367
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,740
when you were through?

368
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,940
But, there was a smell.

369
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,140
There sure was... a funny smell.

370
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,840
It's probably the spider children burning in the furnace.

371
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,340
They're burning.

372
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,940
Grandmother said so, didn't she?

373
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,840
She did!

374
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,340
The furnace?

375
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,440
It's true, there's something strange burning in here.

376
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,240
Hey, come to think of it, what was the meaning of that?

377
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,840
You know, you said it, didn't you?

378
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,340
You told Robert... "murderer"

379
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,940
The day Robert was leaving,

380
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,240
Misa told us to go and ask him what his feelings were,

381
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,340
so we went to the bus stop.

382
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,340
We asked him, "How do you feel about Misa?"

383
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,740
Then, Robert wrote a terrible thing down on paper.

384
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Didn't he?

385
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,240
A terrible thing?

386
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,040
He wrote, "Die!"

387
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Die?

388
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,040
-It's terrible! -Terrible...

389
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,440
Don't let it bother you. The children probably saw wrong.

390
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,540
I shouldn't have shown that name card.

391
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,940
Name card?

392
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,640
Let's see... I'm sure I...

393
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,240
Here, this is it.

394
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,940
They found this name card inside the wallet

395
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,340
and made a lot of noise.

396
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,540
They asked, "Who did you get this from?", "Where is this person?"

397
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,040
Look at this.

398
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
I got it out somehow.

399
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
-Hey, this is... -No way...

400
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,040
You're kidding.

401
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,140
Isn't it a stun gun?

402
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,240
-Kazuha! -Oh, Heiji!

403
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,940
I feel much better now.

404
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,140
Take off your clothes!

405
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,540
-Huh? -Never mind, just let me see!

406
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,240
-What're you doing? -Wait a minute, Conan!

407
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,940
Why am I the only one to get hit?

408
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,140
Well, I'm a child.

409
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,840
It's here.

410
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,540
Small burn marks on her back.

411
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,540
She was knocked out with a stun gun after all.

412
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,540
And? Did she say anything else?

413
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,240
She didn't see the murderer,

414
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,040
but she said she found a strange ball in front of the storehouse.

415
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,440
Ball?

416
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,940
She said that it was a ball about this small.

417
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,540
BB shot!

418
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,540
That's it!

419
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,240
There was that method!

420
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,940
If that's so...

421
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,440
That thing...

422
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,140
Should be somewhere...

423
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,940
In this room.

424
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,540
I found it! Hattori, it's here!

425
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,240
The marks of a thumbtack!

426
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,740
I've found it too.

427
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,640
Strange string with loops on the beam ends.

428
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,540
It's just as we thought, isn't it?

429
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,040
There's no mistake. That person is the murderer!

430
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,840
The murderer didn't need to escape from here.

431
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,440
That's crazy!

432
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,040
It was to avenge Misa

433
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,740
who committed suicide in this storehouse three years ago!

434
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,340
Mi... Misa's revenge?

435
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,140
There's only one person who could have done it

436
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,540
without anyone noticing!

437
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,940
And, that's you!

438
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,740
Next Conan,

439
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,760
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Final)"

440
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,860
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,660
"Roman letters"
