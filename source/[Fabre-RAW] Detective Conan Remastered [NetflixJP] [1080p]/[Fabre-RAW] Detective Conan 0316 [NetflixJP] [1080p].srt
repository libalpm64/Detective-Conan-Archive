1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,040
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,940
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,740
A graceful mask on the professional wrestling ring.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,940
Solve the case of the masked man.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,360
"Tohto Kokugikan"

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,760
Now, let's have renown Detective Kogoro Mouri

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,660
pick the real Wolf Face!

11
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,960
Who of the five men here is the masked man, Wolf Face,

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,260
in the Teito professional wrestling match occurring right now?

13
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,260
Well?

14
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,160
Is it number three?

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,960
Yes! Correct! Exactly!

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
What spectacular deduction!

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,860
It's so obvious that he'd figure it out

19
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,960
with the panel of the real one

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,460
being pushed at his face like that.

21
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,460
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 1)"

22
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,460
Darn it.

23
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,660
I just took this job because they're giving me good pay,

24
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,260
but what a place to have come to.

25
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
What do you mean?

26
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,360
Combat sports are pretty popular among the young people nowadays.

27
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,260
Even the boys in our karate club

28
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,460
use professional wrestling techniques on each other for fun too!

29
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,060
Hey...

30
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,160
Especially that technique that was just used...

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,660
Wait, what was it called?

32
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,560
No matter how cool they try to make it look,

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,660
it's no more than just kid's stuff.

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
All right!

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,760
You're totally into it.

36
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,160
Hey, Ran.

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,860
When is that Wolf Face that was introduced a while ago going to fight?

38
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,860
He's incredibly strong, isn't he?

39
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,360
Wolf Face is fighting in the junior heavyweight title match,

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,860
so it'll be at the very end, which is the main event!

41
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,160
Are you saying that he's a champion or something like that?

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,460
Right!

43
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,960
After he debuted making an official announcement

44
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,660
that he would take off his mask if he loses,

45
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,060
but he never lost in all the single 65 matches he fought!

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,360
But, I'd like to see him lose for once.

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Why?

48
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,760
Because if he loses,

49
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,660
we get to see what he looks like!

50
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,760
Hiding his face with a mask.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,960
I'll bet he's probably just some super ugly dude or going bald!

52
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,760
Sorry for being an ugly man.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,860
But, he isn't bald.

54
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,960
What?

55
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,460
Then, don't tell me that...

56
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,160
You're him?

57
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,560
"Takaharu Ogami (27)" -This is the true identity of Wolf Face.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Are you sure it's okay, though?

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
Coming out without your mask to a place like this.

60
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,460
No worry,

61
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,160
Wolf Face is said to be Mexican.

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Besides, I sometimes fight in the opening performance with this face.

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,260
But, everybody thinks that I'm just a young wrestler.

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,560
Well, I don't use the techniques of Wolf Face at that time,

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,760
so I'm just another young wrestler.

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,360
So, no one knows your true identity then.

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,460
Yes.

68
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,960
Nobody except for the personnel of Teito Pro Wrestling knows about me.

69
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,460
Neither do my parents nor my girlfriend.

70
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,360
I debuted as a mysterious masked wrestler

71
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
in Mexico to begin with so...

72
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,060
You don't have the kind of face that you'd have to hide, though.

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,960
I like to wear masks!

74
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,560
It's been my dream since I was a child.

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,860
Excuse me.

76
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,760
Doesn't it bother you at all?

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,060
To hide your identity and deceive everybody.

78
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm sure that your girlfriend wants you to tell her the truth.

79
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,460
I really wish that you were Shinichi, Conan.

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,460
Ran.

81
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,060
I just said a while ago, remember?

82
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,560
That my true identity is

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,060
a secret that only the personnel of Teito Pro Wrestling know of.

84
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,460
If an outsider revealed my true identity,

85
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,560
I won't have to suspect her for having given away my identity

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,160
if she doesn't know, right?

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,260
But...

88
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,660
Besides, I don't want to worry her.

89
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,060
Wolf Face's match is aired on TV during Golden Time.

90
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,560
The match may turn out to be violent and bloody too so...

91
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,960
Well,

92
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm more or less prepared for what is to come.

93
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,760
The time when I take my mask off

94
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,260
is when I lose and sink into the mat.

95
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,560
It's when Wolf Face dies and leaves the ring.

96
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,960
But why did you reveal your identity to us, then?

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
Well,

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,860
the thing is, my girlfriend is a great fan of the Sleeping Kogoro.

99
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,060
I figured you wouldn't give me your autograph

100
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,560
if I was just another young wrestler.

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Why didn't you ask me when you were wearing your mask,

102
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,760
just a while ago, then?

103
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,860
But Wolf Face can't communicate in Japanese

104
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,160
unless he uses an interpreter!

105
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,860
Therefore, I wouldn't be able to ask you to give me an autograph

106
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,560
addressed to a girl with a Japanese name!

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,460
Besides, I figured that you're not the kind of people

108
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,160
who would give away my secret and shatter the dreams of children.

109
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
Well, of course not.

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Mr. Ogami, it's about time.

111
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,760
Okay!

112
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,160
Well, then... Her name's inside,

113
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
so please give me your autograph!

114
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
His identity will be revealed

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,860
when he dies?

116
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,260
Mr. Nagase.

117
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Mr. Nagase! Turn this way please.

118
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,860
Mr. Nagase! You're finally going to be fighting against

119
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,460
the invincible champion Wolf Face for his belt,

120
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
can you tell us how you're feeling now?

121
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,760
How am I feeling?

122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,860
All I want is for the people here to watch me.

123
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,760
To watch me fight with all my might

124
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
"Hyota Nagase (25)" -against that idiot Japanese leopard

125
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,460
whose mask will be torn off when I defeat him.

126
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,260
Japanese leopard?

127
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,960
You mean Wolf Face is Japanese?

128
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,360
-Oh, no. -It's a joke, just a joke!

129
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,660
We're in a rush, so interview us later.

130
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,760
"Japanese Team Locker Room" -Hey, Nagase!

131
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,460
Just what do you think you're doing?

132
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,560
"Iwao Ushigome (36)" -Didn't I tell you

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,460
that Wolf Face's identity is top secret?

134
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,860
And that you're not supposed to say a word about it to anyone!

135
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Are you aware of the fact that

136
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Ogami shoulders half the popularity that Teito Pro Wrestling enjoys!

137
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,160
Then, what is it you're saying, Mr. Ushigome?

138
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,460
Are you telling me, the star of the main event,

139
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,660
who has worked and polished strength as well as gain popularity

140
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,860
to go out of my way to lose deliberately on this gala occasion?

141
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,660
It's true that you're just a good looking

142
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,360
or even better than him,

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,060
but with the strength that you possess now,

144
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,960
you couldn't possibly beat him.

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
Just what are you talking about?

146
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,260
What's important for a wrestler is looks.

147
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,360
If not, a wrestler with your ability

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,460
would've become popular a long time ago, right?

149
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,860
What?

150
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
Hey, Nagase!

151
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
That's no way to talk to your superior.

152
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
"Hiroyuki Sakuma (25)" -Hold it.

153
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,160
You don't want to hurt a precious body just before a match, do you?

154
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,460
Okay then.

155
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,660
I'll be flexing my body like always in the room.

156
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,760
So when it's time to fight the match, please call me.

157
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,860
Well, if I win,

158
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,160
I'll give all of you a mask as a gift.

159
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
So that you guys can all hide your ugly faces

160
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,660
and gain more popularity.

161
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah. No problem.

162
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,660
Chances are 200 percent my win.

163
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,060
Although, it's a hidden fact,

164
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,060
his left knee is not completely healed yet.

165
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,060
If I target his weak point, I can stop him in his moves

166
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,460
and if it looks like I'm about to lose, that's fine too.

167
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,360
All I have to do is peel his mask off on the mat, that'll be it.

168
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,560
Everything will work out just fine.

169
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I made the young ones at your place wear masks

170
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,760
and I practiced time and again with them

171
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,960
on how to tear off the mask during the match.

172
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,560
The match will be cancelled once his identity is revealed,

173
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,960
and I'll be fired,

174
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,160
but Teito Pro Wrestling's popularity will go down too.

175
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I'll end up the unfortunate wrestler

176
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,860
who is fired from Teito Pro Wrestling

177
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,260
for revealing the true identity of Wolf Face,

178
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,460
and go up on the ring at your place.

179
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm counting on you when that time comes.

180
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,860
Okay, Bankoku Pro Wrestling?

181
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,460
He sure is the leader of Teito Pro Wrestling.

182
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,560
It's finally time for Wolf Face to fight!

183
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,060
I gotta go to the restroom!

184
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,660
You better come back quick or the match will start!

185
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,160
Yep!

186
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,760
So where's the restroom...

187
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,560
Mr. Ogami?

188
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Amazing.

189
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,160
He's so different from who we just saw.

190
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,060
Hey, Wolf!

191
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,760
"Leonardo Rossi (30)" -Good luck.

192
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,260
Shoots. I better go to the restroom quickly.

193
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,860
Hey, kid!

194
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,960
This place is off limits to everyone except authorized personnel!

195
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,360
Come on, I'm just going to the restroom!

196
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
No...

197
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,660
The restroom for the general public is on the second floor...

198
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,360
Hey, Nagase!

199
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
Just what do you think you're doing!

200
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,660
The match is going to start!

201
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey, Nagase! Hey!

202
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,860
What's up, Sakuma?

203
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,460
Mr. Kiba.

204
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,260
Is something wrong with Nagase?

205
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,460
Well...

206
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,060
Nagase won't come out of the waiting room.

207
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,360
Well, we had a slight argument a while ago,

208
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,660
and nobody wanted to be his corner man,

209
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,560
so I decided to be his corner man and came to call him but...

210
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,460
Then, why don't you just drag him out of there

211
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,060
and make him get up on the ring!

212
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,360
But, he gets outraged saying that

213
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,460
his concentration is interrupted

214
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,960
if we go in without his permission.

215
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,760
Who does that green-horn think he is?

216
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,060
Hey, Nagase!

217
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,860
Hurry up and come out!

218
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,360
Nagase?

219
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,760
Hey, get a hold of yourself! Nagase!

220
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,060
No good.

221
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,660
There's no pulse.

222
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,060
What?

223
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,960
Hurry and get an ambulance and the police!

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,860
Yes, sir!

225
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Darn it, who...

226
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
who could've done a thing like this?

227
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,860
Don't you hear a strange noise?

228
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
What?

229
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,960
A strange noise?

230
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,860
It's coming from that bag.

231
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,460
A hidden camera?

232
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,260
Nichiuri TV?

233
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,660
"Nichiuri TV"

234
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,260
Don't tell me that the killer is in the video...

235
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,660
This is...

236
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,560
Wolf Face?

237
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,980
We're sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.

238
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,780
The challenger for the junior heavyweight title match,

239
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,180
Hyota Nagase, is unable to fight

240
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,380
because of a sudden accident.

241
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,380
Therefore, the title match with Wolf Face that had been scheduled

242
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,180
has been cancelled.

243
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,380
What?

244
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,780
No way.

245
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,180
The victim is Mr. Hyota Nagase, age 25.

246
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
He belongs to the Teito Pro Wrestling team.

247
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,980
A professional wrestler?

248
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,580
Yes, he'd been getting stronger day by day

249
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,480
and was steadily gaining popularity.

250
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,980
He seems to have been stabbed to death.

251
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,080
Yes.

252
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,180
He's been stabbed in a total of three places

253
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,380
which are his back, his chest and his stomach.

254
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,480
The blow that took his life was the final stab in his chest.

255
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,380
How do you know that the final stab was in his chest?

256
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,880
Well...

257
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,780
that's what we saw on the video before you got here, Inspector.

258
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,080
The video?

259
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,680
You mean a surveillance camera?

260
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,380
No. It is a hidden camera that Nichiuri TV,

261
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,080
who holds broadcasting rights

262
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,880
to our Teito Pro Wrestling Team set up in this room!

263
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,180
They wanted to film in secret Nagase

264
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,980
just before the title match.

265
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,780
Whenever he fought at the Tohto Kokugikan,

266
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,580
he used to do warm-up exercises alone in this room.

267
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,180
I see.

268
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,680
Will you show me that video too?

269
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,880
Oh. Here it is!

270
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,180
If so, the case is just as well solved!

271
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,880
The killer is shown on this tape, right?

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,080
Well, the thing is...

273
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,680
Wolfman?

274
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,180
Rather, a wolf's mask?

275
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,780
Wolf Face.

276
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,380
The masked wrestler that is popular now.

277
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,580
He's a junior heavyweight champion

278
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,980
and was scheduled to fight Nagase tonight for the title.

279
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,080
Since Wolf Face publicly announced that

280
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,680
he would reveal his true identity if he lost.

281
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,780
So it was a match in which his mask was at stake.

282
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,080
Which means in order to protect his title and identity,

283
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,380
the masked wrestler killed Nagase before the match

284
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,080
without realizing that there was a hidden camera here.

285
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,280
Oh, not really.

286
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,980
Not really!

287
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,480
Almost all the people of the Teito Wrestling Team

288
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,380
besides Nagase knew that there was a hidden camera here,

289
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,480
and once this wolf's mask is worn,

290
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,980
Wolf Face could be anybody, right?

291
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
Conan?

292
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,680
Which means that the killer is Wolf Face himself

293
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,480
or a professional wrestler with the same kind of physique as Wolf Face

294
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,980
who wants to set him up as the killer, right?

295
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,480
A professional wrestler with the same physique?

296
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,880
Because the killer that is in the video is

297
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,880
about the same height as Mr. Nagase.

298
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,080
Wolf Face is about the same height as Mr. Nagase, right?

299
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah.

300
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,180
Besides, this room is closed to everyone

301
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,680
except authorized personnel!

302
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Only another professional wrestler

303
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,680
could stab a professional wrestler in a place like this!

304
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,780
I already gave the forensic officers

305
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,680
the murder weapon, which was a knife,

306
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,080
the gloves and outfit of the killer,

307
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,680
that was found in the restroom nearby, so don't worry!

308
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,480
I see.

309
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,280
So, Mr. Kiba,

310
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
please bring that masked wrestler and the professional wrestler

311
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,680
that has the same physique as he does here!

312
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,180
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,080
But, Conan. Why are you here?

314
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
I wanted to go to the restroom

315
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
and I heard the other wrestler making a fuss

316
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,180
over Mr. Nagase not coming out of his room,

317
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,880
so I came to check out what was happening!

318
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,680
No, rather,

319
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,580
who brought you to this professional wrestling grounds?

320
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,680
The famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, Inspector!

321
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,380
It's you after all, God of Death.

322
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,680
Well... Please let me see it too.

323
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,680
The video tape which shows the murder being committed!

324
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,780
Oh, it's you.

325
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,380
This is when the killer comes into the room.

326
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,680
Hey...

327
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,580
I have nothing to talk to you about before the match.

328
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,980
Or do you want to ask me to lose on purpose?

329
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,180
The video just shook just now.

330
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,080
I think the killer's foot touched the bag

331
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,880
in which the video camera was hidden.

332
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,380
I already told you that I'm going to go for it seriously tonight.

333
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,380
He's already holding the knife.

334
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,780
-What do you think you're doing? -He stabs Mr. Nagase in the back first.

335
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,380
Then as he turns around,

336
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,180
Mr. Nagase is stabbed again in the stomach.

337
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,580
Hey. Isn't the victim trying to say something?

338
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,980
But, the killer covers his mouth so nothing can be heard.

339
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,080
He's going for the mask!

340
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,280
Come to think of it,

341
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,780
the blood smeared mask that I found in the restroom

342
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,880
was ripped about 10cm under the part of the right eye!

343
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,980
Then, maybe the killer's face can be seen.

344
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Then, the final blow in the chest.

345
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,380
Darn it! Only if the killer would look this way.

346
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,680
But, why is he looking around like that?

347
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,280
Maybe he's looking for something?

348
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,480
He fell?

349
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Okay, get up, just the way you are!

350
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,580
Then, we get to see a close up of his face

351
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,380
from the ripped part of the mask.

352
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
Darn it. It's the left profile of his face of the part

353
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
that's not ripped that we first saw.

354
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,280
And, he leaves the room.

355
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,980
But, if a blood smeared man like him walks around,

356
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm sure that somebody would've noticed him.

357
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,180
Oh, yes,

358
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,680
the young wrestler who was in front of the restroom

359
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,080
seems to have seen a man with blood on his outfit.

360
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,280
It seems that the man went into the restroom

361
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,180
hiding his head with a bath towel,

362
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,880
that the young wrestler took no special note of him,

363
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,580
thinking that it was just another veteran wrestler,

364
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,880
who was smeared in blood after fighting in the opening performance.

365
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,580
I see.

366
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,980
If he hid another outfit in the restroom beforehand,

367
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,280
he can change clothes then come out

368
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,080
looking as if nothing had happened.

369
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,280
What time is the estimated time of death?

370
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,880
A definite time has not been concluded yet but...

371
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,980
It was probably some time during the match Mr. Kiba was fighting.

372
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,080
Because three minutes after the killer left the room,

373
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,180
Mr. Kiba's roar of victory.

374
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,780
See! You'll hear it soon!

375
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,580
-Right? -You're right.

376
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,880
Which means that the time the murder was committed is...

377
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,080
Around 7:20 pm.

378
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,680
Inspector, I brought the four

379
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,680
who have a physique similar to Nagase.

380
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,880
So, please let me know when you find the murderer.

381
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
It's a promise, Inspector.

382
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,980
Okay.

383
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,380
Oh, there he is!

384
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,780
Mr. Kiba! Is it true that Mr. Nagase was killed?

385
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,480
Are the four that just went in suspects?

386
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,980
Please answer us, Mr. Kiba!

387
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
-Mr. Kiba? -Mr. Kiba!

388
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,280
Gosh, his lips are sealed.

389
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,780
But, this means the end of the Teito Pro Wrestling Team.

390
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,580
Yeah.

391
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,080
All right then, from the person on the right,

392
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,980
please give me your name

393
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,980
and where you were around 7:20 pm.

394
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,580
Yeah.

395
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,380
Judging from the circumstances,

396
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,780
the killer should be among the four.

397
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,880
Who was it?

398
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,780
Who was it among these four people?

399
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,580
The person who killed Mr. Nagase.

400
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,660
"Mask"

402
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,480
Sleeping Kogoro will make his appearance in the next episode.

403
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:41,100
I see, Pops is my mask.
