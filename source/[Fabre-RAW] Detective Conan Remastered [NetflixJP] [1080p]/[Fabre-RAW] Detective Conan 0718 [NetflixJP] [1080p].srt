1
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:07,755
Pops is invited over to the villa in Shizuoka prefecture,

2
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,989
where Mrs. Chika Kaido does her writing work

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,555
as a writer of mystery novels,

4
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:13,455
because she wanted him to tell her about

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:17,355
his experience as a famed detective. However...

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,455
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Mouri.

7
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:26,005
Those two are hooked up with each other.

8
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,007
Yes?

9
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,455
Those two?

10
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:34,013
My husband Yuichi and my disciple Kohko.

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:38,017
In other words, I'm an eyesore to them both.

12
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:42,555
But, I'm not letting them have their way.

13
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:47,255
I'm sly and strong like an ogre, you see.

14
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,755
Mrs. Chika may look strong

15
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,037
but she's actually a very weak person.

16
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,555
She's always depressed and in a slump

17
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:05,055
and can't sleep a wink unless she relies on sleeping pills.

18
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:11,255
Chika puts on a tough front

19
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:14,455
but she's actually a sensitive woman.

20
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,155
I was surprised when I saw her looking absentmindedly

21
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:20,055
at the knife in the kitchen.

22
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,455
She probably had a tough time going on living

23
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:25,455
so could've been contemplating suicide.

24
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,755
Okay then, Mr. Mouri. I hope you get a good night's rest.

25
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:36,075
-Oh. -Goodnight.

26
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,855
What's with those people?

27
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:40,355
They invite me to come over

28
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:42,081
but don't listen to what I have to say at all.

29
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,255
They suddenly start talking about family affairs too.

30
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:49,355
Oh, what a beautiful moon.

31
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:52,091
True.

32
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:55,255
Tonight should be a good night for working on my manuscript.

33
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:58,755
But, there's a proverb that goes, happiness is short-lived.

34
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:02,655
This could be the last time.

35
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,755
I had no idea what were on the minds of the three

36
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,855
till the incident occurred.

37
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:25,255
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

38
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,355
are slashed by the light of deduction.

39
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,655
The whereabouts of the murder triangle

40
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:30,655
is not known till the following day.

41
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,155
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,133
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,155
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:11,950
"The Devil's Circuit"

45
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,237
Oh, Mrs. Kaido was laughing late at night?

46
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,250
Yeah. I think it was about 02:00.

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,350
When I got up to go to the restroom.

48
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,850
I wonder what was so funny.

49
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,850
Something really good must've happened.

50
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,950
I guess so.

51
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,250
I wonder if all three of them are still asleep.

52
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,257
But, it's already after 08:00.

53
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,259
It's time at least one of them is awake already.

54
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,950
Let's go check them out.

55
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,550
Uh, the curtains are still closed.

56
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,265
I wonder if nobody's really up yet.

57
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,350
Uncle! Look!

58
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,550
Mr. Kaido! Mrs. Chika!

59
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,750
Darn! I'm busting the door down!

60
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,950
Judging from rigor mortis, she died late last night.

61
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,281
Since there are no signs of external wounds,

62
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,250
she could've died of an illness.

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,850
Or, maybe she drank poison.

64
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,250
Either way, we'd better go let Mr. Kaido know!

65
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,550
Mouri here, I'm coming in!

66
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,297
No good. He's dead.

67
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,050
There are no signs of external injuries either.

68
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,350
Sleeping pills, eh.

69
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,050
Don't tell me that?

70
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,313
Her too?

71
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,750
At any rate, Ran, call the police!

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,850
Okay!

73
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,319
Uh, Pops. This pitcher...

74
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,321
seems to have been a set with the glass cup

75
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,650
that was found beside Ms. Shimura, right?

76
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,850
Looks to be so.

77
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,650
Huh? It's wet.

78
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,750
Uh, the floor here is wet.

79
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,050
The water of the pitcher probably spilled or something I guess?

80
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,150
In the trash box, there's an empty can of beer

81
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,650
and two chocolate bars.

82
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,341
And, some tissue.

83
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,850
Uh. I wonder why this chocolate bar was thrown away?

84
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,450
It's not even opened.

85
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,050
Beats me.

86
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,950
It seems she was still working when she died.

87
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,357
Maybe a dying message or something is written.

88
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,850
Can't be.

89
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh! Something's come up.

90
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,650
An Ironic Circuit.

91
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,150
Bombed the wrong target.

92
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,250
"The lone winner who survives gets to laugh out loud."

93
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,375
It doesn't look like a dying message.

94
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,150
Maybe it's an idea memo for a novel.

95
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,850
Dad! The police say they'll be here right away!

96
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,050
Okay.

97
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,450
Long time no see! Mr. Mouri!

98
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,650
Long time no see, Yokomizo.

99
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,350
Yes!

100
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,750
Oogawara, this is the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

101
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,850
I'm Tomonori Oogawara.

102
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,550
I hear that you've done a lot for Inspector Yokomizo.

103
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,850
Well, not really.

104
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,450
But! We the police are working towards

105
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,050
and trying to mature into an organization

106
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,411
that doesn't have to rely on people like you

107
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,250
by improving day by day.

108
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,150
At any rate, Mr. Mouri, please take us to the victims.

109
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,421
Yeah. This way.

110
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,550
Inspector Yokomizo!

111
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,050
Why do we need a guy like him taking charge of the site?

112
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,050
Well, don't let it bother you.

113
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,439
There's a box with 20 chocolate bars inside it on the desk.

114
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,050
Inside the box there were 17 bars left,

115
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,150
and near the box there was one empty wrapper left,

116
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,750
presumably of a chocolate bar that had been eaten.

117
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,449
Furthermore, from the closet of her husband,

118
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,453
Mr. Kaido's room, a syringe was found.

119
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:55,650
As a result of the coroner's inquest,

120
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,750
it was found that they died of poisoning.

121
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,950
The body was turned over to undergo a judicial autopsy.

122
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,465
Uh, Dad. Is this suicide or homicide?

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,650
You don't know.

124
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,150
I heard that Mrs. Kaido liked that chocolate bar

125
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,050
and used to always eat it while working.

126
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,050
And yet, I wonder why she threw those two away?

127
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,483
Moreover, it seems that Mrs. Kaido

128
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,450
used to take five tablets of sleeping pills every night.

129
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,050
But, it seems that her husband Yuichi

130
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,050
was against her taking sleeping pills.

131
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,495
Huh? But wasn't there an empty bottle of sleeping pills

132
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,497
near the corpse of her husband?

133
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,450
In other words, that was Chika's.

134
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,050
Hey, where'd you get that?

135
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,150
Oh.

136
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,250
I found it in the living room.

137
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,507
Let's see...

138
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,509
I love to take long baths,

139
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,750
and gulp down cold beer after coming out.

140
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,517
But my doctor told me I shouldn't.

141
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:02,521
There was an empty can of beer in the trash box, right?

142
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,550
It seems she bought that pitcher

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,150
because the doctor told her to stop drinking beer.

144
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,950
So that she could drink it after taking a bath.

145
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,529
The assistant that went to buy it with her

146
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,850
seems to have taken a liking to it.

147
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,650
Assistant, you mean Ms. Shimura?

148
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,050
This is it?

149
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,950
What? 1.2 million yen?

150
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,150
A pitcher like that?

151
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,550
So, it's the price for you, eh.

152
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,550
What? Mrs. Kaido passed away?

153
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,850
When?

154
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,950
Before that, who may I ask are you?

155
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,950
I'm Toda of a monthly magazine called Mystery Paradise

156
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,050
in charge of Mrs. Kaido.

157
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,550
She sounded so well

158
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,850
when I talked to her on the phone last night and yet...

159
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,563
Sorry for questioning you here.

160
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,550
No, don't be.

161
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,567
And you seem to have called her last night?

162
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,450
Yes, on her mobile.

163
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,750
She didn't answer the first time,

164
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,550
but on my second try at around midnight...

165
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,750
And how are you getting along so far?

166
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,583
It's going to be a fantastic masterpiece, Mr. Toda.

167
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:09,150
I'll turn over the history of Japan's mystery novels.

168
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,050
Either way, she was full of zeal.

169
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,050
If so, this is most likely not suicide.

170
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,750
I see, okay. Good work!

171
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,599
We got the result of the autopsy

172
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,850
along with the report from the forensics.

173
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,150
First of all, around 23:30, Mr. Yuichi Kaido passed away.

174
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,611
The sleeping pill that he drank was laced with poison.

175
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,450
Next, at around 01:00, Ms. Kohko Shimura passes away.

176
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,050
Poison was laced on the inside of the glass

177
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,621
in which she drank tea with.

178
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:47,150
And Mrs. Chika Kaido dies at around 02:00.

179
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,150
Poison was inserted in the chocolate bar that she ate.

180
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,050
By the way, about that chocolate bar,

181
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,450
there was another one laced with poison inside the box.

182
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,050
But including the two that were found in the trash box

183
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,643
and the other ones no poison was detected.

184
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,650
Which means the three were most likely killed.

185
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,950
Yes.

186
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,450
What? Why is it homicide?

187
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,651
If they wanted to commit suicide,

188
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,450
all they had to do was drink the poison directly.

189
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,050
They would never go out of their way to lace the glass cup with poison

190
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,650
or, do something as bothersome

191
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,150
as to insert poison into the chocolate.

192
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,663
In other words, that chances are high that

193
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,950
they were poisoned to death.

194
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,250
Also, all three were killed by different poisons.

195
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,150
What?

196
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,150
Then, don't tell me that...

197
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,150
Yes. It's possible that there are three murderers.

198
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,683
It's true that although a person was out to kill three people,

199
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,150
there would be no need to prepare three types of poison.

200
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,689
But, it's strange that three different culprits

201
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,650
would kill three different people on the same day.

202
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,695
Inspector. All the things that were laced with poison

203
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,699
belonged to Mrs. Chika Kaido, weren't they?

204
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:01,950
Yeah.

205
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,450
If so, can't we look at it this way?

206
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,550
Although there may have been three culprits,

207
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,050
their target was just one person.

208
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,850
Mrs. Chika Kaido.

209
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,715
What? Then, it means that her husband and Ms. Kohko Shimura...

210
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,850
Poor thing, I guess that just happened to end up as victims.

211
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,150
-Uh, Pops. -Huh?

212
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,350
Didn't Mrs. Chika say something strange yesterday?

213
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,550
Something about her being an eyesore to the two.

214
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,150
Just what does that mean, Mr. Mouri?

215
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,150
Her husband and Ms. Kohko Shimura

216
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,650
were having an extramarital affair.

217
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,250
That's right, isn't it?

218
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,150
Is that right?

219
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,750
It seems that her husband wanted a divorce.

220
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,650
However, since Mrs. Chika was a very proud person,

221
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,150
she had no intention of granting him one.

222
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,753
In other words, in order for them to get together

223
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:58,150
they had no choice but to get Mrs. Chika Kaido out of their way.

224
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,750
Of the three culprits, two of them

225
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,350
were Yuichi Kaido and Kohko Shimura!

226
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,767
I see. That explains what they said yesterday, right?

227
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,150
Although Mrs. Chika seems to be strong,

228
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,350
she's actually a very weak person.

229
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,550
She was probably contemplating suicide.

230
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,650
It was probably what they had schemed before killing her

231
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,750
to make her death look like suicide.

232
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,250
They tried to set you up as an eyewitness, didn't they, Dad?

233
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,450
It's true that from the syringe that was found

234
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,750
in Yuichi's room,

235
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,350
poison laced on the chocolate bar was detected.

236
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,797
This does it.

237
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,801
Moreover, his prints were detected on all the chocolate bars

238
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:46,050
that were found in Mrs. Chika Kaido's study.

239
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,807
All the chocolate bars?

240
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,650
Including the third culprit, "X"

241
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,350
each of them schemed to kill Mrs. Chika Kaido.

242
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,950
But, ironically, not only Chika,

243
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,823
but also Yuichi Kaido and Kohoko Shimura ended up

244
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,550
killing each other with the poison that they used.

245
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,850
But who then is the third culprit "X"?

246
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,850
I hear that the editor

247
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,833
always goes through a tough time trying to deal with

248
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,750
the selfishness of the novelists that they're in charge of.

249
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,150
Isn't that right, Mr. Toda?

250
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,350
Mr. Mouri? I wonder about that deduction of yours.

251
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,250
You were full of hate for Mrs. Chika, weren't you?

252
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,847
Oh, no.

253
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,250
I think it's most appropriate to figure out

254
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,450
who would benefit most from her death

255
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,450
if we want to arrive at a motive.

256
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,550
If a novelist suddenly dies,

257
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,150
this would be very attention gathering.

258
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,250
If this happens, wouldn't the books and magazines

259
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,450
connected with the novelist sell very well?

260
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,865
I see!

261
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,650
What do you mean, I see!

262
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,750
I didn't kill her! I really didn't!

263
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,150
I wonder why Yuichi's prints were on all of the chocolate bars?

264
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,050
Not only that, but the empty can of beer

265
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,950
that the doctor had told her not to drink

266
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,950
that was found in the trash box.

267
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,650
And, Chika who was laughing out loud late at night

268
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,650
that Pops said he saw.

269
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,150
Darn. There are too many unexplainable things.

270
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:26,705
The thing that bothers me though is...

271
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:32,605
I'm sly like an ogre and strong.

272
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:34,905
What did she go out of her way to say something like that?

273
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:40,005
I wonder if everyone really suspects him.

274
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,405
I can't believe that he's the culprit, though.

275
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:55,905
Don't worry,

276
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,405
I'm sure that Pops will come up with the right solution.

277
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:04,405
So that's the story.

278
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,945
What's the matter, Conan?

279
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:10,205
Here, this! I'll get going before you.

280
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,505
Hey, Conan.

281
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:17,805
Inspector Yokomizo, were Yuichi's prints also detected

282
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:20,205
on the syringe that found?

283
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:21,805
No, they seem to have been wiped off

284
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:24,005
so nobody's prints were found.

285
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:25,605
But, isn't it strange?

286
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,605
That the prints on the chocolate bars are left behind

287
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:30,105
and yet the ones on the syringe are wiped off?

288
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,605
Well, I guess so, but...

289
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:36,975
Mr. Toda. You called Mrs. Chika twice last night, didn't you?

290
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,405
Yeah. At first I called her around 23:30.

291
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:43,605
But, Mrs. Chika didn't answer that call, right?

292
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:46,985
I found out from Mrs. Chika the second time I called her

293
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,705
that she was taking a bath from about 23:00.

294
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:54,405
What about it?

295
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,995
Pops is a great detective after all!

296
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,605
He figured out the entire mystery, he says.

297
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:00,999
Right, Pops!

298
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,805
Huh?

299
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,005
Huh? Oh, well...

300
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:11,009
So, as I was saying the third culprit is Mr. Toda...

301
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:16,005
-you'd think, but not so. -What?

302
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,405
Are you turning back on what you said at this point?

303
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:21,019
Mr. Toda, I hear that

304
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,205
Mrs. Chika Kaido was depress over a slump.

305
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,605
Oh, yes. From some time ago.

306
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:30,005
It doesn't matter whether she was going through

307
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,005
a slump or not, is there!

308
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:35,605
If she was really killed, that is...

309
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:38,805
The third culprit "X"

310
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,405
is she herself.

311
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,505
The one who laced the chocolate bars with poison

312
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:45,043
was Mrs. Chika Kaido, herself.

313
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:48,505
That was of course to commit suicide.

314
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:51,505
Then, Mrs. Chika Kaido committed suicide?

315
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,505
No, she didn't commit suicide.

316
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,705
Huh? But, you just said so yourself, didn't you?

317
00:17:56,705 --> 00:18:03,505
As Mrs. Chika Kaido would say, an ironic circuit has spun.

318
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:06,105
She is a very proud novelist

319
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:08,305
and she felt like annihilating herself from this world

320
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,105
after her continued slump.

321
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:12,505
But, she could bear thinking that

322
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,705
her husband and his lover would become happy after her death.

323
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,705
So, as her death gift to him,

324
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:20,305
she decided to frame her husband as criminal

325
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:22,105
who had killed his wife.

326
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:26,005
First of all, she inserted poison

327
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,087
into her chocolate bar to commit suicide.

328
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:35,105
Then she hid the syringe that she used inside Yuichi's room.

329
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:38,205
In the meantime, aside from all that was being schemed,

330
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:41,099
her husband and Ms. Kohoko Shimura

331
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,103
were also each scheming to kill Mrs. Chika Kaido.

332
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:49,405
Mrs. Chika Kaido had been taking a bath from around 23:00.

333
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,505
During this time, Ms. Kohko Shimura

334
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,505
switched Chika's sleeping pills with ones

335
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:56,705
that were laced with poison.

336
00:18:56,705 --> 00:19:00,405
And at about 23:30, Mr. Yuichi Kaido

337
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,305
laced poison onto the glass cup set to the pitcher

338
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:06,205
from which Chika drinks water out of after taking a bath.

339
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:09,127
And then, at that time,

340
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,505
as if to calm himself down,

341
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:15,133
he takes Chika's sleeping pills with him,

342
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,137
drinks it, and the first one, Mr. Yuichi Kaido dies.

343
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,905
Then at around midnight, when getting out of her bath,

344
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:26,705
Mrs. Chika got a call from Mr. Toda.

345
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:29,147
She then, probably inadvertently

346
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,149
dropped the pitcher to the floor.

347
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:35,153
I'll turn the history of Japanese mystery upside down.

348
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:38,905
But, I guess she couldn't bring herself to drink the water

349
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:41,159
that spilled out of the pitcher she dropped.

350
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:46,405
She went to the kitchen and changed her mind.

351
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:49,167
She figured that she was going to die soon anyway

352
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,169
so she brought the beer that the doctor told her not to drink

353
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,705
back to her study and drank it.

354
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,175
Then, just before 01:00,

355
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,505
Ms. Kohoko Shimura who probably couldn't get to sleep

356
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:04,105
comes over to the kitchen uses the glass to drink tea.

357
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:09,605
The second person, Ms. Kohoko Shimura dies.

358
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:11,505
And then, at 02:00.

359
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,805
Chika who returns to the kitchen again

360
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,505
discovers the body of Kohoko

361
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,205
and the glass cup on the floor.

362
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:23,205
She concluded that her husband had thought of poisoning her.

363
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:30,205
She then figured everything out.

364
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:33,705
That the two had mistakenly killed each other

365
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:36,005
in an attempt to kill her.

366
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,005
She had lost all though of committing suicide anymore,

367
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,505
so she threw the chocolate bar that she had laced poison with

368
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:43,221
into the trash box.

369
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,705
I've got to live!

370
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,005
I'll live and write a novel...

371
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,229
about the pathetic twosome!

372
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:52,905
"An Ironic Circuit"

373
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,233
"Bombed the wrong target"

374
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,805
"The lone winner who survives gets to laugh out loud"

375
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:09,805
And, the third person, Mrs. Chika Kaido dies.

376
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:15,005
Hey, wait a second, Mr. Mouri.

377
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:17,255
To think that she would mistakenly eat the chocolate bar

378
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,905
that she had planned to commit suicide with,

379
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,505
is a little outrageous, don't you think?

380
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:26,105
Another ironical circuit had spun.

381
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,265
Huh?

382
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:31,805
The first call that you made to her at 23:30, Mr. Toda.

383
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,271
It's most likely

384
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,275
Yuichi was lacing poison just around that time.

385
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,277
Surprised at hearing the phone ring,

386
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:42,205
he dropped the chocolate bar.

387
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,905
It was then that the position

388
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:46,905
of the poison laced chocolate bar changed places.

389
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,705
There's no other explainable situation,

390
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:54,805
for all the chocolate bars having his prints on them, is there?

391
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,379
How about it, Oogawara?

392
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,605
Now you know,

393
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:25,905
why I want Mr. Mouri to help me out, don't you?

394
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,005
Yes, sir!

395
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:31,105
I've seen with my very eyes the greatness of a renown detective.

396
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,105
So he says.

397
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:35,393
As long as you understand, it's okay with me.

398
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:40,705
Hey, Dad, come off with that remark.

399
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:43,005
I goofed a bit.

400
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,105
I can't laugh about Pops.

401
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,860
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,400
"Washing Machine"
