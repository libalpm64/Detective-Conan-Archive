1
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:05,525
Is this the rumored cactus?

2
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:07,525
It's a cactus called "Golden Barrel"

3
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:11,125
that takes 50 years to bear flowers.

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,125
-What? 50 years? -Yeah.

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,625
"Zenzo Sunada (66), a wealthy man" -I took care of it

6
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,725
since it was this small, right?

7
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:20,325
After so many years, it grew to be this big

8
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,025
and even blossomed with flowers.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,525
Which means that you were raising it

10
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,425
from the time you were about Ran's age?

11
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,425
Exactly, sonny.

12
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:36,125
Sonoko, you came to see it in the past with your father, you know.

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,325
Really? I don't remember.

14
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:43,325
It's not surprising that you don't remember,

15
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:46,025
since you were still a toddler then.

16
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,825
That's why.

17
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:51,925
By the way, where's the flower that you're referring to?

18
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:54,925
-It's right there. -Huh?

19
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,925
It's enveloped by fluffy bird feather-like thorns at the top.

20
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,925
The yellow flower.

21
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,525
Really! How cute.

22
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,925
I guess...

23
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,625
True.

24
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,225
The vivid colored memories of summer

25
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,325
solve mysteries all season round.

26
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,025
In a greenhouse under tight security,

27
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,125
there're rare cactuses with stingy thorns.

28
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,825
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,825
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:25,225
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:11,927
"Cactus Rhapsody"

32
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:16,827
But what a large number of cactus you have here.

33
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,527
I guess you've got some valuable ones here, too.

34
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:21,727
Aren't you plagued by thieves at times?

35
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:25,327
Well, there's a specially ordered alarm set up here.

36
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,527
At night, I'm the only one who can cancel the alarm,

37
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,727
since I have this card.

38
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,727
It's sort of like the automatic wicket at the station.

39
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:37,927
But, why do you keep it in your pocket?

40
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,127
I keep whatever's important in here,

41
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,527
that way I feel safe.

42
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:47,727
Dad!

43
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:51,127
What do you guys want?

44
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,827
We heard from the lawyer!

45
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,427
That you changed the will?

46
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:58,227
Quiet! I've got guests!

47
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:00,827
Shut up! Tell us what's going on!

48
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,127
I'm not wasting my breath for something like that!

49
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:03,627
Get out of here.

50
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:06,327
My cactus are going to wither!

51
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,927
No good, Yasuyuki. Let's take care of this later.

52
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,127
Yeah.

53
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,727
You're going to explain this to us later, understand?

54
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,027
Gosh!

55
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:16,527
Really, I tell you...

56
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:19,727
The Golden Barrel finally blossomed, and yet...

57
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,827
Yashiro!

58
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:26,127
Where are you, Yashiro?

59
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:29,627
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,327
What seems to be the matter, sir?

61
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:34,727
What the heck is that?

62
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:41,027
I told you I don't use unglazed pottery planters!

63
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:42,227
Put it away right this minute!

64
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,427
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,227
What a temper.

66
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,427
Excuse me.

67
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,627
We came at a bad time, didn't we?

68
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,527
He seems to have been known in his younger days as "Zenzo the Ogre"

69
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:00,427
an aggressive wheeler-dealer.

70
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,527
How embarrassing.

71
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:06,327
I did shout at her, but she's a good worker, that Yashiro.

72
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,927
She's a super good cook, too.

73
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,127
Is that right?

74
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,227
She's so different from my two sons.

75
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:16,927
Okay, I'm going back to the house now,

76
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,127
but why don't you all take your time looking around?

77
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,827
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

78
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:31,627
What're you doing?

79
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:32,927
Dad.

80
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:35,327
I'm asking you what you're doing?

81
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,727
What else?

82
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,727
Unluckily, what you're looking for is here.

83
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,127
"Will"

84
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:47,327
Is it true that you're not dividing the inheritance to us?

85
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,527
I've decided to donate everything

86
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,927
to the Botanical Garden along with the cactuses.

87
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,927
What?

88
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,227
Not what you expected, eh?

89
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,427
You're going to give your money up

90
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:00,527
to your cactuses rather than your sons?

91
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,927
Most naturally.

92
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,827
A professional golfer, my foot.

93
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:06,527
All you do is live off me despite being a grown man.

94
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,227
I'm not giving you any money!

95
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,827
What?

96
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:14,427
Well, the flower was so small

97
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:16,627
despite him asking us to come over and look at it, wasn't it?

98
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,127
Not really.

99
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,727
He gave us an opportunity to see something really rare,

100
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,427
so we should be grateful.

101
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,927
That... I wonder what it is?

102
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,627
Isn't it a radiator for the water heater?

103
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:32,027
I'm sure it's regulating the temperature in the greenhouse.

104
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:33,427
I know, I know!

105
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,427
If I remember correctly, the temperature's being controlled here.

106
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:36,827
Hot!

107
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,127
Hey, Sonoko. Are you all right?

108
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,327
If so, what do I have to do to get you to go through

109
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,527
with the original will?

110
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,027
I have no intention of reversing the will

111
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,527
unless you succeed my business!

112
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:52,027
Are you telling me to quit golf?

113
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:53,327
You're just a third tier player

114
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,727
who's always defeated in the Monday qualifying anyway.

115
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:58,427
How dare you, saying what you will...

116
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,527
You took the words right out of my mouth!

117
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:04,027
Okay then, I'll do as I please!

118
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:07,727
You! What're you doing?

119
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,227
Well, you see...

120
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:13,527
I'll bet you came to ask for money as usual.

121
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:14,927
Same to you!

122
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:16,627
You won't get away trying to outdo me.

123
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,327
-What? -Please stop!

124
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,227
You're standing in front of your father's room, you know!

125
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:22,227
Who cares.

126
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:24,427
Shut up!

127
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,627
You come back after a long while,

128
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:29,427
and all you both do is talk about money!

129
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:32,627
Wrong. I came because I was worried about you.

130
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:34,027
Don't lie!

131
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,827
I already heard that the import car dealer

132
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,927
that you just started is suffering financially!

133
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,727
Worry, my foot.

134
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,427
It's no use fawning upon the great to win his favor.

135
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:48,627
All he has in mind are his cactuses.

136
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:52,427
No use picking a fight now.

137
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:53,827
Let's cool it for now,

138
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:56,227
and try convincing him later tonight.

139
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,927
We're back.

140
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:04,227
After looking through all the plants, I'm kind of hungry.

141
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:05,227
Really.

142
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:08,427
"It's cake before flowers" is a phrase made just for you.

143
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,227
Conan!

144
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,527
Are you all right?

145
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,527
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

146
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,027
-I'm sorry. -Gosh.

147
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:21,127
I'm really sorry.

148
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:26,027
This...

149
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:28,927
Thanks.

150
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,527
Ms. Yashiro.

151
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,327
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,527
Please bring my dinner to my room.

153
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:37,027
Yes, sir.

154
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,127
Yasuyuki really changed.

155
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,327
I don't like him.

156
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,727
I'm filled.

157
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,027
I really ate.

158
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,827
Sonoko, you ate too much.

159
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,527
You took one helping after the other.

160
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:53,827
I couldn't help it.

161
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,527
When you got the craving, is when to go for it.

162
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,227
Ms. Yashiro.

163
00:08:58,227 --> 00:08:59,227
Yes, sir?

164
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:02,827
I'll go out to practice golf for a while.

165
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:06,327
I'm going to go check on the car that I left back in the garage.

166
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:09,127
Bye.

167
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,327
Ms. Yashiro, thank you for the dinner.

168
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:14,227
It was really delicious.

169
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:17,827
Will you please teach me the recipe for that gravy sauce?

170
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:21,527
Oh? Just who are you going to make it for?

171
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,727
Don't tell me you're making it for your hubby.

172
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,927
No. Come off it, Sonoko.

173
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,727
I'm glad that you liked it.

174
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,927
Would you like some coffee now?

175
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,927
But we were just thinking of leaving.

176
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:37,527
Is Mr. Sunada still in the greenhouse?

177
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,027
Yes. Every day from about 20:00 to 21:00,

178
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:43,127
he spends his time taking care of the cactuses.

179
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:44,827
Let's go tell him goodbye, then.

180
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:49,627
But I've told not to let anyone in until 20:30.

181
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:52,127
So, could you wait a little while more?

182
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,227
Okay then, I guess we'll take a eating break here for a while longer!

183
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,927
I wonder if I'll get fat?

184
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:59,627
Come on, Sonoko.

185
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,627
That's nothing new.

186
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,427
Yasuyuki?

187
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:14,427
Wrong! I didn't do it!

188
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,827
What's the matter?

189
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,227
What's that?

190
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,227
Isn't that the will?

191
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:22,327
This is...

192
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,127
Don't tell me that...

193
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,327
Mr. Sunada!

194
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,727
Mr. Sunada!

195
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:41,636
The cause of death seems to be from a fractured skull

196
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:43,736
from being beaten in the head with a shovel.

197
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,636
The estimated time of death

198
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:50,036
seems to be between 20:00 to 20:30.

199
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:52,936
And who was the first to find the body...

200
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:58,336
Gosh. I sure run into you kids a lot at the scenes of crimes.

201
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:02,036
Hey, tell me about the circumstances when you found the body.

202
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,636
Uh...

203
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:06,736
After dinner, we were chatting in the living room,

204
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:07,736
when at about 20:00,

205
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:10,136
the sound of the alarm in the greenhouse went off.

206
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,436
Then, we went to look together with the housekeeper, Ms. Yashiro.

207
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:17,836
And saw Yasuyuki there.

208
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,436
You saw Yasuyuki?

209
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:24,336
Yasuyuki was holding Mr. Sunada's will!

210
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,836
Will?

211
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:30,736
It seems that Mr. Sunada recently rewrote the will!

212
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:35,336
Then, right after that, Misa ran into the greenhouse

213
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:38,236
and when we all followed her inside...

214
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,236
Mr. Sunada was...

215
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:44,436
Hey, let's go interrogate the people involved!

216
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:45,536
Yes, sir.

217
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:46,636
Like I already told you,

218
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,536
I rushed inside because I heard the alarm

219
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,636
and found Dad lying on the floor!

220
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:54,036
Why were you in the greenhouse

221
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,036
when you said you were going out to practice golf?

222
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:59,836
That's because Dad texted me to come over.

223
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,836
See!

224
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,236
I see.

225
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,136
You received it at 20:20.

226
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:08,836
How about the victim's cell phone?

227
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:13,436
Likewise, at 20:20 he texted to Yasuyuki.

228
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:18,236
Which means that the old man was alive till then.

229
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,936
And, what about the will?

230
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:25,336
Weren't you standing in front of the greenhouse holding the will?

231
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:27,236
Well...

232
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,636
I took it from the pocket of Dad who was lying on the ground.

233
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:31,636
Which means that you...

234
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,236
Wrong! I didn't do it! Please believe me!

235
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:38,236
This was found near the corpse.

236
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:39,636
A golf tee!

237
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:42,236
That's Yasuyuki's...

238
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,236
Yasuyuki!

239
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,836
Beats me.

240
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:47,836
Why would something like that be in a place like this?

241
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:50,536
Please believe me! I didn't do it!

242
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,736
I didn't kill Dad!

243
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,236
Please believe me!

244
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,236
After being texted to come here by the victim,

245
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:59,936
you pretended to go practice golfing

246
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:02,136
and headed for the greenhouse.

247
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:03,636
The victim let you in,

248
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:06,836
but you got into an argument with him concerning the will.

249
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,236
You lost your temper and picked up the shovel that was by you

250
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:12,336
and beat Mr. Sunada to death!

251
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:17,136
You took the will to gain inheritance, then fled.

252
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:22,536
Back then, the alarm sensed you and it went off!

253
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,036
-Isn't that what happened? -No way.

254
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:28,136
Inspector Yokomizo.

255
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:30,136
Mr. Sunada should've had a card

256
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:33,736
to cancel the alarm in his pocket, you know.

257
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:37,036
I wonder why that wasn't taken?

258
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:40,536
If he used it, the alarm wouldn't have gone off, don't you think?

259
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:45,136
It's true that the card to cancel the alarm

260
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:47,636
was in the victim's pocket.

261
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:51,236
You probably just panicked after beating your Dad up.

262
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,336
-Isn't that right? -There's more.

263
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:54,936
What is it now?

264
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,436
There's the planter of the Hairbrush Cactus

265
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,436
on the ground near Mr. Sunada, isn't there?

266
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:01,936
When we first came in here to look around,

267
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,936
it wasn't on the ground, you know.

268
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,936
It was probably knocked over

269
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,636
when the culprit was struggling with the victim!

270
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,436
If so, isn't it strange?

271
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:12,336
What is?

272
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:16,336
Because the soil that spilled out from the planter is super dry.

273
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:19,536
I wonder if the soil will dry up like that in just an hour or so?

274
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:25,036
Besides, a cactus thorn was poked in by Mr. Sunada's chest.

275
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,036
Never mind already!

276
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:28,436
Just stop keep butting your nose into the investigation, kid!

277
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,936
Off you go!

278
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,636
Okay!

279
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,036
It's withered.

280
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:42,136
Maybe...

281
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,436
This is...

282
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:52,736
I see. So, that's the story.

283
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:55,436
If so, the culprit is...

284
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,636
definitely her!

285
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:05,436
Why? Why do I have to be arrested?

286
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:08,736
I'll hear you out at the station.

287
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,836
Cut out your talking and get inside!

288
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,936
Like I've been saying, I didn't do it!

289
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,836
Please believe me!

290
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:21,636
What's up? Did something happen?

291
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:24,036
No, the thing is... nothing really.

292
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,936
But the alarm's ringing!

293
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:33,436
Sonoko.

294
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,036
What's going on?

295
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,636
Hey.

296
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,736
I figured everything out with that alarm just now!

297
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,036
What?

298
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:45,536
This was an alibi trick

299
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,936
carried out by using the alarm device!

300
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:52,736
The crime took place before Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.

301
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,836
First, at around 20:00

302
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:57,336
when Mr. Sunada went into the greenhouse,

303
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:00,136
the culprit snuck in together

304
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,036
and committed the crime.

305
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:07,236
Then, in order to frame Yasuyuki for the crime,

306
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,136
something that only he could've possessed,

307
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,036
was left behind at the scene of the crime.

308
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:15,936
After that, you used the dead Mr. Sanada's finger

309
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:18,936
to text Yasuyuki to come over

310
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,436
and set it so that the mail would be sent out at 20:20,

311
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:24,236
the time that would validate your alibi.

312
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,536
You preset the mail to go out at the fixed time.

313
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:30,536
That can be checked on by calling the cell phone company.

314
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:34,236
Moreover, the culprit used the alarm cancelling card

315
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:37,836
from Mr. Sunada's pocket and fled from the greenhouse.

316
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,936
Then, the culprit snuck away from us

317
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:41,636
taking a route that would be a blind spot from the living room

318
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,236
and went in through the backdoor to the house.

319
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,336
Then soon...

320
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,536
after you got back to the scene of the crime,

321
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:52,536
you returned the card to his pocket.

322
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:56,136
That's why when Yasuyuki took the will,

323
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:59,336
he didn't realize that the card was there.

324
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:04,436
Of course not, because the culprit had the card then.

325
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:06,036
Which means...

326
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:10,036
When the alarm rang, nobody was at the greenhouse.

327
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:13,136
If so, why did the alarm go off?

328
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:15,836
That's the key to this trick.

329
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,336
The trap that the culprit used taking advantage

330
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,436
of how the alarm system works.

331
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:23,836
Look on top of that radiator.

332
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:27,336
There is an unglazed pottery planter on it, isn't there?

333
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,336
The alarm system of this greenhouse

334
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:32,636
senses the slightest far-infrared ray

335
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,836
that is emitted by the human body and goes off.

336
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:39,236
Unglazed potteries as well as ceramics characteristically

337
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:41,736
have a tendency to emit far-infrared rays

338
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,936
like does the human body when heated.

339
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:47,536
The culprit took advantage of this.

340
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:50,236
Will something like that really make the alarm go off?

341
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,736
I tried out a small experiment.

342
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,536
I put that planter over there

343
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:59,136
because Sonoko told me to.

344
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,436
I see. That's why the alarm went off a while ago.

345
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,036
This circumstance is exactly the same

346
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:07,636
as when Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.

347
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:11,636
In other words, it splendidly rang.

348
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:14,736
And there's only one person

349
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:17,136
that can carry out this crime!

350
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:22,136
Ms. Misa Yashiro.

351
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:24,236
You!

352
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,636
Misa.

353
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:28,936
It's truly and interesting story.

354
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:32,536
But that's just a deduction, isn't it?

355
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:34,636
Do you have any proof?

356
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:37,536
Proof that would indicate that I'm the culprit?

357
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:40,536
When you beat Mr. Sunada to death,

358
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,336
you happened to knock over a cactus.

359
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:49,636
But you needed to move the cactus

360
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:52,036
that was on the dead man's chest away, no matter what.

361
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:56,036
In order to take the alarm cancelling card away!

362
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:57,236
Back then,

363
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:01,236
I'm sure that the thorns of the cactus poked into your hand.

364
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:05,636
Which means, that the one who has traces of wounds from this

365
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,336
is the culprit.

366
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:10,736
Misa. If you insist on not being the culprit,

367
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:13,336
please show us your hand.

368
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,936
You win.

369
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:22,936
Just as you said, I'm the killer.

370
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:25,036
This is...

371
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:27,636
But, how did you figure it out?

372
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,836
The cactus told me.

373
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,636
What?

374
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:34,436
When I came to the site,

375
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:37,336
the soil that spilled out of the planter that was knocked over,

376
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:40,636
was already starting to dry up.

377
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,436
Moreover, the flower that was bloomed in the day time,

378
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,536
was for some reason withered.

379
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:47,936
And that's when it hit upon me.

380
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,236
That it had something to do

381
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,936
with the temperature here in this greenhouse.

382
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:59,136
And the other key to solving this trick is the planter.

383
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,336
The planter that was once put away after you were scolded,

384
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:04,636
was for some reason left behind at the scene of the crime

385
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,236
after the crime was committed.

386
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:09,536
That's when I was totally convinced.

387
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:13,036
That you, Misa, are the only one capable of being the culprit.

388
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,136
Because you're the only one

389
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:19,136
who knew where the planter you put away was.

390
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:26,436
I hated Zenzo Sunada.

391
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:28,636
In his prime years,

392
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:31,536
he ran one company after the other into bankruptcy

393
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:33,336
by his merciless ways

394
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:36,436
and ran many business owners into committing suicide.

395
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:45,036
One of them was my Father, who raised me by himself.

396
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,836
After Sunada retired

397
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:51,336
and put out a want ad for a housekeeper,

398
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:55,336
I made up my mind to avenge my Father's death with my own hands.

399
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:59,136
At seeing his sons going after their Father's money

400
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,636
and indulging themselves to the max,

401
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:06,036
I decided to put the blame on one of the two sons!

402
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,936
Ms. Yashiro.

403
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,436
At learning suddenly that all of you were coming,

404
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,636
it's true that I hesitated

405
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:14,536
on whether I should go through with my plan or not.

406
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:17,436
But I only had today.

407
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:19,836
A day when the whole family would gather together was rare,

408
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,636
so I only had today.

409
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,836
I'll hear you out at the station.

410
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:26,236
Yes, sir.

411
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:29,236
Misa.

412
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:34,736
Your feelings of wanted to hate Mr. Sanada...

413
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:36,636
I sort of understand it.

414
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:40,736
You lost your precious Father, after all.

415
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,436
But that doesn't mean

416
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:49,136
you can take a person's life for revenge.

417
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:31,936
I don't know why, but I'm really sleepy.

418
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:34,436
But you're really something, Sonoko,

419
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:37,436
to solve such a difficult case like that!

420
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:39,336
Really?

421
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:43,436
Well, if this Super Detective Queen of Deductions handles a case,

422
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,136
all of them are a piece of cake to solve!

423
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,236
Gosh. All you did was sleep.

424
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:54,536
You not only caught a wink, you know.

425
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,636
Cactus, cactus...

426
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,720
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,580
"Date"
