1
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:07,002
March 14th is White Day.

2
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:09,102
Talking about White Day,

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:11,502
did you receive anything, Ran?

4
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,993
A gift in return from Shinichi.

5
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:20,902
You gave him hand-made Valentine's chocolate too, didn't you, Ran?

6
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:22,802
Well, I did sort of give it to him.

7
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:25,502
Or rather, he ate it without permission.

8
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:30,502
I wonder if Kygyoku's going to give me something,

9
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:32,302
in return on White Day.

10
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:34,013
If you give somebody chocolate on Valentine's Day,

11
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,402
you get a return gift on March 14th!

12
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:40,502
First, you casually give him a Valentine's Day gift

13
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:42,702
and exactly a month afterwards on March 14th,

14
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,023
if he gives you a gift in return,

15
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:47,802
the bells of days of romance after romance will resound.

16
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:49,402
But, if you get nothing, then the footsteps of broken love

17
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:51,402
will close in.

18
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,702
Footsteps of broken love?

19
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,102
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

20
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,502
Tears are start of all dramas.

21
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:01,202
Sour tasting White Day.

22
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:03,302
Solve the miracle trick!

23
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:05,002
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,902
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,702
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:53,816
We were invited to the 8th Anniversary party

27
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:56,155
of the establishment of Urai Confections.

28
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:59,616
Every year on the anniversary of his company's establishment day,

29
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:00,916
President Urai puts on a performance, such as magic shows and skits

30
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,161
to entertain his guests,

31
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:06,165
and everyone waits in anticipation.

32
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,716
However, President Urai lets out a loud groan and collapses to the floor.

33
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:15,916
Everyone thinks that he's acting out a mystery skit this year,

34
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,177
but the president actually dies.

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,416
Although it is concluded that

36
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,616
he died potassium cyanide poisoning,

37
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:26,716
the president's wife Hoshie, who was nearest to him

38
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,616
was reading Ran's palm at the time,

39
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,816
and could not have administered the poison.

40
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,816
A bottle of poison and wafers are discovered

41
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:36,616
from inside the president's car.

42
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,197
This increases the possibility of him

43
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,316
having committed suicide because as Hoshie explains,

44
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:44,816
they were contemplating a divorce as well as splitting the company up.

45
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,616
However...

46
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:51,716
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 2)".

47
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,215
Mrs. Urai.

48
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,916
I think you should hurry up and call the store.

49
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,016
What?

50
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,516
Because all you and the president

51
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:08,016
were doing at the party was drinking, and not eat.

52
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:09,916
So, I'm sure you reserved to have dinner

53
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,231
at a high-class restaurant or something, right?

54
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,616
I have no reservation.

55
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,516
"Hoshie Urai (49)" -To get my husband's metabolism going,

56
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,516
"Taruto Urai's wife" -eating dinner out was a no-no.

57
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:23,116
I made healthy meals for him every day.

58
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,816
I see.

59
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:27,416
What was the menu for tonight, then?

60
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:31,716
Well, I wonder what it was.

61
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:34,516
This party ends at 21:00.

62
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:38,257
And if you see the guests off, it'll be later,

63
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:42,261
so you must've bought the ingredients already, right?

64
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,263
You couldn't have known beforehand

65
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,265
that something like this was going to happen, right?

66
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:49,216
What the...

67
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:51,816
What's with this child?

68
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:58,616
There's no doubt that she's the killer.

69
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:01,616
But, how did she administer the poison?

70
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,116
When the president collapsed,

71
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,516
Mrs. Urai was definitely reading Ran's palm

72
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:07,916
and both of her hands were full.

73
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,516
If she were to set something up,

74
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:14,293
it would've been the words that she mumbled, "Is it working?".

75
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:18,016
But, what could she make him do with those words?

76
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,216
What? Do you have pollen allergy, Officer Chiba?

77
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:26,016
Yes. I drank medicine,

78
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,516
but doesn't seem to be working.

79
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:31,916
And, if I drink too much, I'll get sleepy.

80
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,516
Working?

81
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,316
I wish there was a miracle pollen allergy drug

82
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:39,816
that won't make you sleepy even if you drink it.

83
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,516
Miracle?

84
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:44,716
Have them hurry on checking the poison and wafers

85
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:46,816
that were found in the victim's car.

86
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:47,816
Yes, sir!

87
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:51,216
Oh, no! Dad's cigarette is on the table!

88
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,516
Oh no, the paper napkin is burnt!

89
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,337
But, I'm sure glad that nothing caught fire.

90
00:05:58,516 --> 00:05:59,816
My God.

91
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:03,816
That's the paper napkin that came with Mrs. Urai's iced lemon tea.

92
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,347
I see.

93
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:11,816
That's why Mrs. Urai deliberately went pass there.

94
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:15,416
Hey, Officer Takagi!

95
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,616
I want you to look for what Pops asked me

96
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:20,116
to tell you to look for.

97
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,361
Look for what?

98
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:27,716
The evidence for the miracle trick the culprit tried to hide.

99
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,373
The cause of my husband's death

100
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,377
is acute drug poisoning due to cyanide compounds.

101
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,516
If anyone could administer the poison to him,

102
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,616
it would be me.

103
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,616
However, at that time, I was holding Ran's left hand

104
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:47,016
with both my hands and reading her palms,

105
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:50,016
so I couldn't have given him the poison using my hands.

106
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,016
Moreover, a container with poison and wafers

107
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:55,516
were found in my husband's car.

108
00:06:55,516 --> 00:07:01,216
On top of that, a wafer was stuck between his molar.

109
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,716
Which means, my husband had the poison wrapped in the wafer

110
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,403
and was holding it.

111
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,016
So, during the party he drank it and committed suicide.

112
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:10,716
That's the only thing thinkable, no?

113
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,411
I guess so.

114
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:17,616
Then, won't you please let the people who came to the party go?

115
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:20,419
Besides, I've been cleared of suspicion too.

116
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:23,316
In the first place, if I were the killer,

117
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:27,516
I wouldn't invite a great detective like Mr. Mouri to a place

118
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,416
that I would plan on committing a crime at.

119
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,716
True.

120
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:35,816
If that were to be one of your strategies, though...

121
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:38,116
it would be a different story.

122
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:43,116
No, that wasn't me, you see.

123
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:44,443
Hold it.

124
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:47,316
When I hear my own voice coming from someplace else.

125
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:50,016
I always feel a prick on my neck.

126
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:53,816
Come to think of it,

127
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:57,716
there are times I feel it on my forehead.

128
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:59,116
Don't tell me, Dad,

129
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:01,216
that the usual has come?

130
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:03,116
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

131
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,116
What does he mean by strategy?

132
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:11,416
Of course, strategy to carry out the murder trick.

133
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,716
In order for her to poison her husband, President Urai to death.

134
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,516
Strategy?

135
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:28,816
Are you saying that I used you, Mr. Mouri?

136
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,016
Yes.

137
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,716
The one who was actually used

138
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:35,516
was my daughter, Ran, who accompanied me here, though.

139
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,216
If she testifies that both your hands were full

140
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,499
because you were palm reading Ran,

141
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:45,316
and that your husband didn't move after he collapsed.

142
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,416
I would, more than anyone else believe her,

143
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,016
and you would be cleared off the list of suspects.

144
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:53,816
You committed the crime during my speech

145
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:57,216
because you wanted to keep me away at the podium,

146
00:08:57,216 --> 00:09:00,816
so that I wouldn't by chance see through your trick.

147
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,616
So, just what kind of trick was it?

148
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,525
What could I have done back then?

149
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,516
You called out to your husband, didn't you?

150
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,016
You asked him, "Is it working?".

151
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,816
So, that was...

152
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:18,816
President Urai was a flashy character who liked to perform magic or skits.

153
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:22,216
Moreover, he hated sour things.

154
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:26,916
I'll bet you conned him in this way, Mrs. Urai.

155
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,816
"I think that everyone will be surprised if you eat the Spy Choco White

156
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,551
that is really sour without changing your facial expression

157
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:36,555
at the next party." Isn't that right?

158
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,316
Don't be silly.

159
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:41,116
My husband got sick eating a sour cake

160
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:43,416
just the other day, you know?

161
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,016
So, there is no way my husband could eat that chocolate.

162
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:51,016
There's a very miracle trick!

163
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:01,558
Miracle trick?

164
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:05,558
You know of the miracle fruit, don't you?

165
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:06,585
I know of it.

166
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:10,358
It's the berry that changes sour things to sweet when you eat it.

167
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,591
It was popular some years ago.

168
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,593
It's a small red berry

169
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:18,597
originally from West Africa that works on the taste buds

170
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,958
and changes sour-tasting things to sweet temporarily

171
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,958
that includes miraculin, a glycoprotein.

172
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,605
It is indeed a miracle fruit.

173
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,607
If you roll it carefully over your tongue,

174
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,258
the effect keeps for 1-2 hours.

175
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:36,615
That's why Mrs. Urai, you gave the berry to the president beforehand

176
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:41,558
and asked him "Is the miracle fruit still working?", right?

177
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,623
Then, don't tell me that the poison was...

178
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,458
Yes.

179
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:51,758
The thing most suitable that was on the table back then for testing

180
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:52,631
was the lemon slice

181
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:56,635
on the glass cup of the lemon tea the Mrs. Urai was drinking.

182
00:10:56,635 --> 00:11:00,358
Mr. Urai cut off a part of the fruit beforehand

183
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:06,058
and put poison wrapped in a wafer into the cut portion of the fruit.

184
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:08,158
So that when the president put it in his mouth,

185
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:11,058
the poison would melt in his mouth.

186
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:12,258
In other words,

187
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:16,058
Mrs. Urai wrapped the lemon that she put the poison inside with something,

188
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,058
snuck it in her pocket and entered the hall.

189
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,659
Then she switched the lemon on the iced lemon tea that she picked up

190
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,958
with the poisoned lemon.

191
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,158
She sandwiched the original lemon in between a paper napkin and hid it,

192
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,667
then waited for my speech.

193
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:33,558
And along with the remark she made, and after the president collapsed,

194
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,673
she swiftly took the poisoned lemon

195
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,675
that was in the president's mouth out and hid it.

196
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,258
While everyone's attention was focused on the president,

197
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:41,658
she switched the original lemon

198
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,458
that was sandwiched between the paper napkin

199
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,685
back into the glass cup again.

200
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:47,958
This way,

201
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,958
even if the police came back later and checked,

202
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,058
no poison would be found from on top of the table.

203
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:59,258
By the way, when you first picked up the iced lemon tea,

204
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:02,701
you deliberately chose a cup from the third row

205
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,558
because you wanted to choose one with a lemon

206
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,658
of the same size as the one you had.

207
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,358
Am I wrong?

208
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,158
Just as would be expected of you, great detective.

209
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:20,158
You're very observant up to the minutest detail.

210
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:24,158
But, I chose that glass cup out of mere habit.

211
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,058
Haven't you done it too?

212
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,458
To pick not the one in the foreground,

213
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,458
but the one in back.

214
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,758
I have!

215
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:34,358
When I buy milk at the convenience store, I always do so.

216
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:37,658
Besides, if my husband took the lemon from my glass cup

217
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,158
and put it into his mouth,

218
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,758
I'm sure someone would've been watching.

219
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:44,743
No, I don't think anyone was watching.

220
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,745
Because I'm sure that the president himself

221
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:50,358
made sure that no one saw him do so.

222
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:53,858
If somebody sees him looking alright eating something sour,

223
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:57,258
he wouldn't be able to surprise them.

224
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,858
But, as for the evidence of the original lemon

225
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:02,761
that you sandwiched between the paper napkin,

226
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,258
the forensic officer has it with him.

227
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:10,058
A while ago, when I deliberately threw my cigarette down,

228
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,158
the paper napkin that I burnt, is it.

229
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:16,458
Is that true, forensics officer?

230
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,158
Yes, this is it.

231
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:22,458
Please take a good look at that paper napkin.

232
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,358
The straight burnt line that extends

233
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:27,458
is arched part way, isn't it?

234
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,789
That's proof that the lemon was there.

235
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,258
In the same way that heat-fixed invisible ink works.

236
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,058
Only that part burns easily.

237
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:39,258
Then, where is the poisoned lemon?

238
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:41,558
I body checked Mrs. Urai,

239
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,258
but didn't find any lemon on her.

240
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:45,158
It's most likely that

241
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,358
after taking the poisoned lemon out of the president's mouth

242
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,807
after he collapsed,

243
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,458
she hid it in between her shoe or something for the time being.

244
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,358
When going to get a body check,

245
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:56,815
she passed beside the table with the glass cups line out.

246
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,819
And she deliberately dropped the iced lemon tea glasses to the floor.

247
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,821
She pretended to sprain her ankle,

248
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:05,158
removed the lemon from her shoe

249
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,558
and mixed it among the lemons on the floor.

250
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:08,827
I see.

251
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,758
-Then, retrieve that lemon. -Yes, sir.

252
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,758
No.

253
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:15,358
I've already found it

254
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,835
because Mr. Mouri asked me to look for it.

255
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,837
The lemon that had a part of it cut out,

256
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,158
that had a slight toxic reaction.

257
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,558
If the president's saliva

258
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:27,258
as well as the fingerprints of Mr. and Mrs. Urai are found on it...

259
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:30,258
-It would be conclusive evidence. -Yes.

260
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:36,858
It was a grudge against sour flavor,

261
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:38,857
so I chose a lemon.

262
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,258
But, it didn't work after all.

263
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,158
It's so difficult to hide.

264
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:46,358
Grudge against sour flavor?

265
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:47,658
Yes.

266
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:51,258
I met my husband at confectionary school.

267
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,871
My husband was a teacher

268
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:56,058
and I was a student.

269
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:58,877
On a certain day, after several years have passed...

270
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:02,658
Two people were to enter a sweets making contest from that school,

271
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:05,558
and I was chosen as one of them.

272
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:09,158
But, it was obvious who would be champion even before entering.

273
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,558
It was already obvious that the other boy from our school

274
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,958
was going to win.

275
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,058
The sour-tasting sweets that he made were truly superb.

276
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:22,158
People from abroad also came to head hunt him.

277
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,658
However...

278
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,858
Who would've thought he would commit suicide a day before the contest.

279
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:32,911
Back then,

280
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:36,915
I thought he had worries that got to him because of his genius talent,

281
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,919
so I did my best and won the championship.

282
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:43,958
Then, why did you say a while ago, that you came in second?

283
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,927
Yes, because if he were there, I wouldn't have won.

284
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,958
Then, several years later,

285
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,758
I married my husband who was very happy

286
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:56,935
that I won the contest.

287
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:01,258
With that man who drove my boyfriend to his death.

288
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,858
Drove your boyfriend to death?

289
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:09,858
The other day, my husband who got sick over the sour cake confessed

290
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,558
that he hated sour flavor

291
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,658
because it reminded him of my boyfriend.

292
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,458
My husband after eating the pie that my boyfriend made before the contest

293
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,158
seems to have told him...

294
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,758
It's too sour.

295
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,758
Are you sure your tongue's okay?

296
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,758
Like so.

297
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:30,358
Since he trusted my husband completely,

298
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:34,358
he had a nervous breakdown and took his own life.

299
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:36,975
My husband cried and said that

300
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,458
it was to make me win

301
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,358
or that he didn't think the man would die.

302
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:52,991
He wasn't aware of how much we both loved each other.

303
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:04,358
You're really something, Mr. Mouri.

304
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,058
I had no idea that you deliberately threw down your cigarette.

305
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:10,458
Oh, well...

306
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,358
Deliberatelsy?

307
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:15,013
Well, today is White Day,

308
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,958
so I thought it'd be better to make everything clear, black or white.

309
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,658
White Day?

310
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:22,158
I guess I'll call Midori.

311
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,458
Midori? It's me.

312
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:36,158
My, Mr. Devil Inspector who loves criminal cases than you love your wife.

313
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,158
Just what did you want with me?

314
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,039
Hey! Don't tell me that you're drunk.

315
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:45,758
How'd you expect me not to get drunk? You octopus head!

316
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,858
Listen well.

317
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,658
In the cabinet next to the refrigerator

318
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:54,758
on the second from the top shelf...

319
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:01,059
I was actually planning to give it to you after I got home today,

320
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,058
but it seems I going to be late coming home tonight too, so...

321
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:08,258
"To Midori" -Well, it's just a little something from me.

322
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:11,069
I hope you like it.

323
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:15,073
Oh, and I haven't eaten lunch or dinner today,

324
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:17,358
so I'd like you to have something ready for me.

325
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,077
Yes, sir!

326
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:29,558
Ran, I'm going to have to go to interrogation after this,

327
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,089
so have Officer Takagi take you home.

328
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,258
-Okay. -And, while you're at it...

329
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:38,058
Stop by at Eri's and drop this off for me.

330
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,101
No joke! A White Day gift?

331
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,103
Don't... don't get me wrong!

332
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,458
I actually got this for Yoko but didn't get to give it to her

333
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,658
and I didn't want it to go to waste.

334
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,109
Sure, sure.

335
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:55,113
The wrapper is obviously different from that of Yoko's.

336
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:01,658
I wonder if Aunty Eri wasn't happy.

337
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,258
Her face looked a bit tense.

338
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:05,758
She's fine.

339
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,158
She was holding back wanting to smile.

340
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:11,158
It's proof that she's really happy.

341
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:13,658
And in the meantime, Officer Takagi was...

342
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,558
This is odd. The roads around here...

343
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,558
I think I'm lost.

344
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,458
Just look at the car navigator.

345
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,758
You know, the car navigator of this car

346
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:27,145
is recently not working too well.

347
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,858
No hope,

348
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:32,758
I guess I'll use the map and navigate you then.

349
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:36,258
What's the street number for the Mouri Detective Agency?

350
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,958
Five-chome.

351
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,558
How bothersome.

352
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,658
"To Miwako"

353
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:47,158
Hooray! I got my gift for White Day!

354
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:49,658
I mean, at least check

355
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,858
the glove compartment of your car, will you?

356
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,558
It's been in there from 3 days ago.

357
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,658
"Mouri Detective Agency"

358
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,258
Officer Sato was really happy, wasn't she?

359
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:03,181
Yeah.

360
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,183
You see, Ran...

361
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,858
Don't worry.

362
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:12,058
Shinichi is not the type to be concerned about White Day,

363
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:13,758
so I'll just forget about it, talking with Sonoko

364
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,558
for a long time on the phone.

365
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:21,458
It's text mail from Sonoko.

366
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,658
I wonder what it is.

367
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,558
I got a White Day gift in return from Makoto!

368
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,058
He said he got a white star mark of victory for me!

369
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:39,217
Oh, no. What shall I do?

370
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:44,058
I can't call Sonoko up anymore.

371
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,591
Look.

372
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:28,091
There something in the door post box!

373
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:30,491
Was there anything in here before we left?

374
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,291
Don't tell me, it's from Shinichi?

375
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,343
"Beika Tax Office" -It can't be.

376
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,347
What could it be?

377
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:50,891
Did I fail to put something in?

378
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:56,091
The deadline for submission of tax forms is March 15th.

379
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,355
It's tomorrow!

380
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:01,091
"White Cough Drops"

381
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,591
Cough drops?

382
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,363
Shinichi?

383
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,091
When I called you last time,

384
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,367
you sounded nasal,

385
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,369
so lick this and get well soon.

386
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,891
White Day...

387
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,791
I know I shouldn't be expecting anything in return.

388
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,379
But receiving something in return

389
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:24,191
makes me feel as if my feelings have reached him.

390
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,691
It sure makes me happy.

391
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:41,399
"Mouri Detective Agency"

392
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,291
Hey, Makoto.

393
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,791
Sonoko.

394
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,991
I'm in the midst of interviewing the victorious team.

395
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:53,091
You mean there's no marshmallow or anything for White Day?

396
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:56,191
Yes, later, right away.

397
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:57,991
It's White Day

398
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:00,191
and still things can get "black" and gloomy.

399
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,420
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,690
"Portable charcoal stove".

401
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,425
What? Shinichi is the victim?

402
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,016
No, I don't think it's the Shinichi we know.

403
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:10,920
-How do you know? -Well...
