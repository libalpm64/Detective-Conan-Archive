1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,280
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,080
After the tears is the "Black Picture"

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,580
Based on the clues that Heiji Hattori presents,

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,980
a great chase for the Black Organization begins.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,180
Who is the man in the picture?

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,080
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:15,206
So hot!

10
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:17,306
Why is it so hot?

11
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:20,106
I mean, trying to pick a fight on my beautiful skin or what?

12
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,606
Really, it's almost the end of August and yet.

13
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:24,606
If I knew it was going to be like this,

14
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:25,906
I should've hurried home like Eisuke

15
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:29,106
and basked in the cool comfort of home.

16
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:35,306
Huh? Eisuke did?

17
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:38,206
Yeah, he does that all the time now.

18
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,906
It's like he disappears when classes are over.

19
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,806
Could it be he likes some girl

20
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:44,706
who works in a store in the neighborhood or something?

21
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,206
That clumsy kid?

22
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:49,006
You think he keeps going to visit with some girls?

23
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:50,406
It's true!

24
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:54,206
No. He probably realized that

25
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:58,206
the woman is hospitalized in a hospital somewhere

26
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,106
and looking all over for her.

27
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,406
The woman called Rena Mizunashi,

28
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,306
who still lies unconscious,

29
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,906
a member of the Black Organization.

30
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:19,206
"The Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 1)"

31
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,806
Since the F.B.I's got her covered,

32
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,606
I don't think he'll be able to find her that easily,

33
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:32,906
but I still don't know who Eisuke Hondo really is.

34
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:36,506
Oh, the phone.

35
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:40,006
The left is for Conan, so the one on the right...

36
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,306
is for Shinichi Kudo.

37
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,406
Ran, I just remembered something,

38
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:47,706
so I've got to go home!

39
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:48,906
Okay.

40
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,906
Yes! Hello?

41
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,706
Hey, how long do I have to keep ringing?

42
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,506
Hurry up and answer the phone, idiot!

43
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,606
Sorry, Heiji.

44
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,706
I've got my reasons too.

45
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,406
And, did you find out anything?

46
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:10,606
Yeah, I caught Mr. Ootaki on his day off and had him check for me!

47
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:13,006
I told him I didn't know what was going on yet!

48
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:19,606
He checked the name list of the schools in Osaka going back 20 years,

49
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,906
but found no student by the name of Rena Mizunashi!

50
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,006
So, we both took her picture along

51
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,806
and went around the Tsutenkaku area where a woman resembling her

52
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:30,506
was said to have taken a picture 10 years ago

53
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:33,106
and asked around.

54
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,006
Although people knew that she is the announcer that's resting work now,

55
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:40,406
there wasn't anyone who remembered seeing her when she was young.

56
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,706
I see.

57
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:44,406
Well, that's all we got on her.

58
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:48,006
When I showed the picture that you forwarded me of Eisuke Hondo...

59
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:49,606
Bingo!

60
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:52,506
I ran into a person who said he knew him when he was a kid!

61
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:54,706
Really?

62
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:58,306
Yeah, it was at a Okonomiyaki shop near Tsutenkaku.

63
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:02,306
He seems to have frequented the shop with his father!

64
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:04,806
Was his "father" a normal looking person?

65
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,406
It seems that he was a reticent guy.

66
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,606
All I found out was that the father's name was "Hondo."

67
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,706
He was called that way.

68
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:13,906
Called that way?

69
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:18,506
Right, he seems to have come with his colleagues occasionally too.

70
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:21,106
It seems that he stopped coming all of a sudden

71
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,506
from several years ago, though.

72
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,506
What kind of "work" did he do?

73
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,906
I don't know.

74
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:28,706
But the present manager says that

75
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,906
maybe the previous manager would know.

76
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:34,106
They seemed to have gotten along.

77
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:37,606
They used be absorbed in talking even after closing time, it seems...

78
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,706
What were they talking about?

79
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,906
You met that manager too, didn't you?

80
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,706
I couldn't if I wanted to

81
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:46,106
because he's not of this world anymore.

82
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,506
Hey, don't tell me that...

83
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,006
It has something to do with the guys in black, does it?

84
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,106
No, no! He died of an illness. He was sick.

85
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,006
He seems to have had cancer.

86
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:57,206
He was pretty old too, you see.

87
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:00,006
Which means, that's as much information you can get?

88
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:02,906
No, this is where everything starts!

89
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:06,906
That manager had a grandchild he really favored.

90
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:11,606
And I was told that he may have told his grandchild everything!

91
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,806
Grandchild...

92
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,006
The grandchild went to a university in Osaka

93
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,506
and lived here for 4 years.

94
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,506
He used to frequent the shop too.

95
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,406
The grandchild is thought to have met the man you're asking about too.

96
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:24,006
And, where is he now?

97
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:26,806
He seems to be running a model shop in Tokyo.

98
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:29,206
I asked for his address and phone number.

99
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,006
If you're going to go visit him, be careful.

100
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:36,106
The father of the guy called Eisuke Hondo is no ordinary guy.

101
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,406
Huh?

102
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:39,506
The colleagues he used to bring to the shop

103
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,906
almost always changed each time he came,

104
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,106
and more than half of them were foreigners.

105
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,406
Moreover, all of them including his father,

106
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,906
seem to have been dressed in black,

107
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:51,306
as if they came right from a funeral.

108
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,006
Are you sure about that?

109
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:54,806
Yeah. In addition,

110
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:58,006
it seems that they really hated to have their pictures taken.

111
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:00,306
That's why their faces are unknown.

112
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:02,406
One more thing, it seems that the name of his father

113
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,406
used to change each time he came.

114
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:07,206
Tsubouchi, Ishikawa and Hondo

115
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:09,606
were just among the many names he used!

116
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:14,406
I see, and he was reticent because he was on his guard.

117
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:19,006
Yeah. So if this grandchild met Hondo's father,

118
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,306
it could be that...

119
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,406
The grandchild who knows their faces is probably being watched.

120
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:27,506
What? You don't need dinner?

121
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,506
Are you at Doc's house?

122
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,106
Okay.

123
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,306
Gosh, that Conan.

124
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,706
By the way, where's dad?

125
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:41,606
What? You're going to do some checking on Eisuke Hondo?

126
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:44,706
-From now? -Yeah, right now!

127
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,806
To be exact, I'm going to see a person

128
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:49,906
who knows Eisuke Hondo's father, that is!

129
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,806
-Are you going to be all right? -I'll be fine.

130
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,006
I already told Ran that I'll be sleeping over at your place too.

131
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,406
That's not what I meant!

132
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:00,806
That man is connected with the men in black, isn't he?

133
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:02,706
That's why I'm in a rush!

134
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,906
If I dilly-dally, she may find out about this

135
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:07,606
and say she wants to come along too.

136
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:11,206
-She? -The one who's taking a bath now.

137
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:14,006
Oh, did you call me?

138
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,606
She's already out.

139
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:20,906
Oh, yes. I was asked by your grandfather when he was still alive

140
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:24,006
to hand something over to a man he had close relationship with,

141
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:27,506
who used to frequent the shop.

142
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,206
I have a pretty good idea who that person is,

143
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:33,106
but I just want to confirm it.

144
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:36,606
Something about this being a very important thing.

145
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:40,306
You mean the customer that used to always bring his son along?

146
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:44,006
Oh, that's right.

147
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:47,506
Do happen to know his name or the place that he works?

148
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:50,606
No. After all, I only met him 2 or 3 times myself.

149
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:53,506
Then, do you remember any characteristic about him?

150
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:56,806
There are 2 or 3 people that I also have in mind here too.

151
00:08:56,806 --> 00:09:00,706
I can't remember just like that right now.

152
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,206
Would you like to take a look at a picture of that person?

153
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,706
Huh? Do you have his picture?

154
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,906
I heard that he hated to have his picture taken.

155
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:12,606
Right, but this picture was taken coincidentally.

156
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,306
It seems that his son was playing around with the camera

157
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,706
and took the picture.

158
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,506
May I go over to take a look at the picture now?

159
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:23,006
Now?

160
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,606
I'm going to close at 7:00 tonight

161
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,306
and going to the sports gym after that,

162
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:28,806
so by the time I get home, it'll be past 11:00 p.m..

163
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:32,406
That's okay! I'll be waiting in front of your place.

164
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,806
Oh, well, okay, never mind the gym.

165
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,006
I'll go straight home!

166
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:37,206
Are you sure?

167
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,206
Yes, I'd like to hear about grandpa too

168
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:40,506
because it's been such a long time.

169
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:42,406
Thank you very much.

170
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:55,306
Strange. It's way past the promised 8:00.

171
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:59,906
Just as I was told, this is the right place, though.

172
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,806
I'll go check!

173
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,106
Stay here, Ai!

174
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,506
The room number is...

175
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,306
Room 302.

176
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,806
I told you to stay in the car, didn't I?

177
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,306
No one's in.

178
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,206
Strange...

179
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:49,906
Hey.

180
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:52,306
-What the? -Doc?

181
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:03,506
It's amazing you found your way all the way here.

182
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:07,106
Gramps.

183
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:28,656
This is a model gun that I sell at my shop.

184
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,256
See, take a good look and you can see that the muzzle is sealed.

185
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:37,756
-You're the one who called a while ago, right? -Yes.

186
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:38,856
Well...

187
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,256
"Souhei Nishizato (32)" -I thought if you were grandpa's acquaintance,

188
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:42,756
"Shopkeeper of a model shop" -you could easily take a joke like this.

189
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:46,156
Grandpa is a gun and suspense freak that's second to none.

190
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:49,956
Whenever I saw him, this is the kind of welcome I got.

191
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:53,156
Oh. Right, I see.

192
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,656
It was so out of the blue that I inadvertently was surprised.

193
00:11:56,856 --> 00:12:01,556
I see, he waited outside till we came to ring the doorbell

194
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:04,256
just so he could do this.

195
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,256
Who are those children?

196
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:10,156
Oh, my grandchildren. They insisted on coming along.

197
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,656
Shouldn't I have?

198
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:13,856
No, it's okay.

199
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,456
It's really quite messy, but please come in.

200
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,356
Wow, talk about really messy...

201
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,156
The slippers are distorted out of shape.

202
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,456
I'm sorry, but could I use the restroom?

203
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,656
Yeah. Here.

204
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:52,556
It sure is hot.

205
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:59,756
It was pretty humid this afternoon too.

206
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:02,456
I guess heat had no way of escaping the room.

207
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:07,056
And, the album I'm sure was on the very top.

208
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,656
Huh, it's not here.

209
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:11,856
I'm sure I put in here.

210
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,356
It's wet.

211
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:20,056
Is it water?

212
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,356
Wet tissue paper...

213
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:35,256
Don't you have the picture in your computer?

214
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,656
Right!

215
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,656
I'll get it out now, so hold on.

216
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,756
Huh? The data's gone.

217
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,156
Strange.

218
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,756
I don't remember deleting it,

219
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,356
and yet, why?

220
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:58,556
I'm sure that somebody snuck into this room.

221
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,556
Moreover, that person was here till just a while ago.

222
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:09,256
What? Somebody suck into this room?

223
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:12,356
And was here till just a while ago... Oh, no.

224
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:14,556
There is several evidence of it.

225
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:16,256
Take the slippers for example.

226
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,956
The slippers by the front entrance

227
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,556
are thrown out just like that and scattered.

228
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,556
Here.

229
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:26,856
When you came back here from work,

230
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:29,956
only the slippers in the toilet were nicely in place.

231
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,056
That means that it is highly probable that somebody besides you

232
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:35,956
used the restroom while you were out, doesn't it?

233
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:40,856
Yeah, but I place the toilet slippers neatly in place sometimes too.

234
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:42,256
Only "sometimes", right?

235
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,156
Not "always for sure", right?

236
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:45,656
I guess so.

237
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:49,256
That's enough to suspect that someone was here, then!

238
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,156
The next thing that caught my eye was...

239
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:56,056
the drops water on the floor.

240
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:57,356
Water?

241
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:00,856
See?

242
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,256
It's hard to tell what it is just by looking at it.

243
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,856
But, judging from the fact that

244
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:08,556
it is especially wet around the desk and in front of the shelf,

245
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,656
as well as taking into consideration that

246
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:12,856
the tissue paper in the wastebasket is damp.

247
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:17,656
It's most likely that this small amount of water is

248
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:20,956
the sweat of none other than the person who snuck in here!

249
00:15:20,956 --> 00:15:22,356
Sweat?

250
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,556
I see.

251
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,656
Whoever it was that snuck in here in the afternoon

252
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,256
in this stuffy hot room perspired profusely,

253
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:28,856
and used the tissue paper to wipe off all the sweating,

254
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,356
then threw the tissue away into the trash can.

255
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:33,956
Even so, his sweat poured down on the floor

256
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,856
where he most probably stopped to look,

257
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:39,256
that is, where the bookshelf and desk are.

258
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:41,456
But, if he was that hot,

259
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,556
he could've turned on the air conditioner, couldn't he?

260
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:44,756
Yeah.

261
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:48,356
After all, I leave all the lights in the room on when I'm out,

262
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:51,956
and I always leave the remote controller of the air conditioner on the desk.

263
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,356
So, it's not hard to find.

264
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:57,856
No. He deliberately didn't turn the air conditioner on,

265
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,556
because if the room is cool when you get back,

266
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:04,256
you'd get suspicious, right?

267
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,356
Besides it's hard to accurately tell

268
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:10,656
how long it would take for the room that has been cooled

269
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,556
to return to the original temperature.

270
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,256
True...

271
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,056
And the most conclusive evidence is

272
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:19,156
the main unit of the computer that is slightly warm yet.

273
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,656
You switched it on just now,

274
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:26,656
and yet isn't it strange that the area around the CPU is already warn?

275
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:29,156
Hey, don't tell me that the guy is after...

276
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,156
Yes, I think it's the picture!

277
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,856
The one that you said you'd be showing us.

278
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:39,856
And the picture that may be of the man I'm looking for.

279
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:42,956
After all, the data in the computer is gone

280
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:44,656
and the album that was supposed to be on the bookshelf

281
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,156
isn't there, right?

282
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:24,656
By the way, the reason I said that

283
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:27,056
I think the person was here till just a while ago

284
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:31,856
is because the sweat on the floor in this stuffy hot room,

285
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:35,556
as well as the damp tissue paper that was used to wipe it.

286
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,156
The surface area of the droplets,

287
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,156
the temperature and humidity of the room...

288
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:40,156
The room was completely closed off

289
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,856
and there was no wind blowing through what so ever.

290
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:45,856
There was also the smell of leftover food.

291
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:50,456
And deducing from how dried the drops of sweat are on the floor,

292
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:54,956
I think that someone was here till just 10 minutes ago.

293
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:59,256
Who the heck are you, anyway, kid?

294
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:01,956
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

295
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,256
Detective!

296
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,556
The question is,

297
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:07,656
how the person snuck in here and who it was.

298
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:11,256
It doesn't look as if the door was forced opened or anything.

299
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,156
The little window in the kitchen is locked

300
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:15,156
and everything looks normal.

301
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:18,756
Which means the culprit snuck in from some place other than this room.

302
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,356
The room on this side. I'm going in.

303
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:30,956
Are these the only two rooms, one here and the one there?

304
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,356
Yeah.

305
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,756
The curtain...

306
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:42,656
The window is open.

307
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:46,056
Then, the person came in from there. How careless!

308
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:49,656
Well, I leave that window open all the time.

309
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,856
I always make georama in this room,

310
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:56,356
so I color and glue the parts as well as shave them off,

311
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:58,056
so there's a lot of dust.

312
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:01,556
That's why I always try to air the room out.

313
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:04,856
Besides, take a look at the street below.

314
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,356
There are quite a few shops

315
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,656
and a lot of people go through this street.

316
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:11,056
If someone were to use a rope to go in and out of here,

317
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,256
somebody is bound to notice right away.

318
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:16,156
Well, I guess it's possible if it were in the middle of the night,

319
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,656
but it's still a little before 9:00 in the evening.

320
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:25,656
Then, does it mean that the person didn't sneak in from there?

321
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,056
No, it's impossible to, from here!

322
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:30,856
More so in broad daylight.

323
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,456
I'm more concerned about you guys

324
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:33,856
than about somebody having broken in here.

325
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,556
Huh?

326
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:36,756
I let you in this room because you said that

327
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:39,556
you wanted to give someone who patronized grandpa's shop

328
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:40,956
something that grandpa asked you to give that customer.

329
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,656
That's why I figured that I should show you a picture.

330
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:44,456
But you walk in here

331
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:45,956
and there's this boy who claims he's a detective.

332
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:49,156
He starts searching all over my room.

333
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:51,456
I really don't feel all that comfortable, you see.

334
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,556
If you have an idea of who that customer is,

335
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,056
all you gotta do is show the stuff

336
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,756
that grandpa gave you to the people you contact,

337
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:01,256
and say, "This is from grandpa, but do you know something about it!"

338
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:04,956
Well, that's...

339
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:07,356
A wallet!

340
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:10,656
It's a big wallet with a lot of money inside it.

341
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,256
Wallet?

342
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:14,756
A wallet...

343
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,756
Right, that's right. It's a wallet.

344
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:21,756
It seems the person forgot it at the shop.

345
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,356
But since it involves money,

346
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:27,556
people may claim it's theirs even if it's not.

347
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,456
I guess it can't be helped if it's a wallet.

348
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:34,756
By the way, does anyone have the spare key to this room?

349
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:38,156
Well, there are. Three people do.

350
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:40,556
Who are they?

351
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:43,556
One of them is my ex-girlfriend, Saori.

352
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,656
She used to come here a lot.

353
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:48,356
It sure was fun when she was around.

354
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:51,956
Come to think of it, I still haven't got the key back from her.

355
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:57,056
The other two are my model making friends, Tago and Furusho.

356
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,056
Whenever a georama tournament is approaches,

357
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,756
I have the two help me out.

358
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:04,256
I gave them the key to this room so they can come and go as they please.

359
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,856
The three people who can easily go in and out of this room

360
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:10,256
are those three.

361
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:13,656
But none of them are inclined to commit theft.

362
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,656
Will you please call them

363
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,756
and ask them what they were doing today anyway?

364
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,156
Okay.

365
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,956
-Hey. -Conan.

366
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:27,356
How come you're not calling the police right away?

367
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,556
Don't tell me the one who broke in here is...

368
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,256
Not a member of the Black Organization.

369
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:36,056
There are too many clues left behind to have been carried out by them.

370
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:40,256
Maybe they were flustered because the resident suddenly came back?

371
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,456
Because remember, he was supposed to be

372
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:44,956
at the sports gym until 11:00 tonight,

373
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,156
but he suddenly changed his mind.

374
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:50,256
If so, that somebody still should've been in this room

375
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,856
when we came in.

376
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:55,256
Well, even if somebody were to be standing guard

377
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:57,456
and notified the person inside...

378
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:59,656
They would most likely ambush and kill,

379
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:00,956
rather than leave so much evidence behind.

380
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:09,456
Then, why aren't you calling the police right away?

381
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:12,656
If the police come and start interrogation,

382
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:15,056
they'll find out immediately that

383
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:16,656
we're not his grandfather's acquaintance!

384
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:18,356
So, before that,

385
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:21,056
I'm trying to make him aware of the situation as soon as possible

386
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,956
and catch the one who snuck into this room.

387
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:27,256
I've got to get it back...

388
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:31,256
The picture of Eisuke Hondo's father that was taken!

389
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,856
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,156
"Washing machine"

391
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,656
-Doc, your laundry... -Thank you always, Ai.

392
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:54,656
I wish you'd do it yourself!

393
00:24:54,656 --> 00:24:56,252
What a hard-boiled attitude.
