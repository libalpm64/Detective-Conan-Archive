1
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,230
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,230
Ai and Mitsuhiko are at bay.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,230
Mushrooms on skewers, can they tell?

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,830
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,930
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,930
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,390
We, the Youth Detective Squad, went into the mountains to hunt for mushrooms.

9
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,390
Absorbed in what he is doing, Genta walks into the hunting area.

10
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,190
We split into two to look for Genta.

11
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,490
Ai and Mitsuhiko

12
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,790
finds the dead body of a hunter who is shot

13
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,290
and end up being the target of the killer themselves.

14
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,690
Dr. Agasa, Ayumi and I ran into Genta

15
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,490
and went along with the three other hunters

16
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,290
to search for Ai and Mitsuhiko.

17
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,390
"Mushrooms, A Bear And The Youth Detective Squad (Part 2)"

18
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,490
This is the last chip.

19
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,390
We've nothing left to drop anymore, Ai.

20
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,790
Ai?

21
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,090
What's wrong?

22
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,190
I think I sprained it slightly when I fled a while ago.

23
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,490
I was trying to walk despite the pain.

24
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,390
Will you let me take a look at it?

25
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,090
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,590
Hey.

27
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,390
Your leg is swollen purple.

28
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,690
I'm going to give you emergency treatment right now, so you stay put.

29
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,190
Emergency treatment?

30
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,390
You mean you've got bandages on you?

31
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,390
Nope. But, these scissors and towels will do.

32
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,790
See, if you cut at every other interval like this,

33
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,390
it makes a perfect bandage.

34
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,190
Doesn't it?

35
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,890
Wrap this twice around the ankle,

36
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,090
go from the heels over to the top of the feet, and back to the ankle.

37
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,490
Then, repeat this several times, wrapping it firmly.

38
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,090
Finally, set it into place and tie it firmly

39
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,090
and it's all done.

40
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,490
You're pretty good.

41
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,290
Actually, when I sprained my leg at camp some time back,

42
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,890
Conan...

43
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,590
Conan...

44
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,890
Conan did the same for me,

45
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,090
He sure knows a lot of things and is really admirable.

46
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,790
Moreover, he's moving on his initiative.

47
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,790
I could never even come close to him in any way.

48
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,690
Silly you.

49
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,590
What?

50
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,190
The important thing is not who you learned of that knowledge from,

51
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,590
but rather, where and how you use it.

52
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,690
You're the best rescue person around for me right now.

53
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,290
Thank you. You sure are a great help.

54
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,490
No problem.

55
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,390
I'm happy to hear that.

56
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,990
Anyway,

57
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,890
it's dangerous staying in the middle of a mountain path.

58
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,890
Let's sit down in the forest and think things out

59
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,390
of how to let Conan and the others know about us.

60
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,590
Yes, I guess so.

61
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,490
What? What was that?

62
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,690
Are you serious?

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,690
Yes. The dead body of a man is hidden under branches and leaves

64
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,790
was found near the place you mentioned to me.

65
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,490
Something about him being shot in the stomach

66
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,390
and having died instantly.

67
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,090
And the dead body of a bear cub seems to have been buried nearby, too.

68
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,090
A bear cub?

69
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,490
Yeah, but this one seems to have had a rock

70
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,390
placed over where it was buried.

71
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,590
At any rate, it's dangerous in the mountains.

72
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,690
Leave looking for the kids to me

73
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,690
-and you get out of the mountains. -Hey, is anything wrong?

74
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,890
Well...

75
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,990
A bear cub!

76
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,090
We thought we found the two, but there were two bear cubs.

77
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,190
We're having the owner of the inn

78
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,890
that we're staying at, look for the two, too.

79
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,690
What a scare.

80
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,690
Come on, let's go after them.

81
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,190
We'll be in a fix if the sunsets.

82
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,390
Hey, why are you hiding the truth?

83
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,490
Don't tell me that maybe the killer is among one of the hunters.

84
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,490
It's not a maybe.

85
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,090
The killer is among them.

86
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,490
The killer is undoubtedly...

87
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,290
among the three.

88
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,290
What?

89
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,190
He's planning to shut Ai and Mitsuhiko up

90
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,190
because they witnessed the murder.

91
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,290
Then, why is he looking for them together with us?

92
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,590
He's blocking their path,

93
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,690
and waiting for them to show up on their own.

94
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,790
He's going to say that he shot them

95
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,390
because he mistook them for a bear.

96
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,490
And, do you have any idea who the killer is, Shinichi?

97
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,590
No, not at all.

98
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,590
There aren't enough clues around.

99
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,390
But, don't worry.

100
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,190
I'm sure that the two who are witnesses

101
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,290
will tell us who the killer is.

102
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,790
They'll let us know in a way that only we'll be able to understand.

103
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,890
Hey, look, there are a lot of mushrooms on the ground here!

104
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,390
Where?

105
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,090
What's with all this?

106
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,190
There are three mushrooms skewed to a branch.

107
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,490
The other four are scattered about.

108
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,990
The names of the mushrooms that are skewered are, from the top,

109
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,090
Tengudake, Matsutake, Shiitake.

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,990
The ones on the ground are 3 Shimeji and 1 Hatsutake.

111
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,790
Hey, is there some meaning to the mushrooms?

112
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,490
I wonder.

113
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,690
No, don't move.

114
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,590
But, I wonder if they'll figure it out?

115
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,690
They will.

116
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,990
That's something he really likes.

117
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,890
A code that we twisted our brains and thought out.

118
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,090
Nonsense.

119
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,290
It seems we don't have to worry about them.

120
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,190
They're absorbed in picking mushrooms.

121
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,490
Let's hurry on along then.

122
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,590
Strange, I was sure there was something to it.

123
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,690
Hey, Dr. Agasa, stay back.

124
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,690
I've figured it out.

125
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,590
I've identified the one who is trying to get rid of Ai and Mitsuhiko.

126
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,190
What?

127
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,290
Get ready for this.

128
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,290
I'll put you to sleep

129
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,190
with this anesthesia gun in a sec.

130
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,590
What are you doing, Conan?

131
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,590
Get out of the way.

132
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,690
I was aiming at the killer right there.

133
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,890
The killer?

134
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,790
The killer is there, among the three.

135
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,190
But, how do you know?

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,090
What else can it be? Ai and Mitsuhiko are dropping potato chips

137
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,090
to let us know where they've walked by

138
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,190
and yet, they're running from us.

139
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,990
The police had already found the corpse together

140
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,690
with the bear cub a while ago and...

141
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,790
The dead body of a bear cub?

142
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,590
Conan is aiming something at someone.

143
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,990
It's his wristwatch type anesthesia gun.

144
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,990
It seems he's figured out

145
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,890
the message we left behind.

146
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,290
When he shoots the needle into the killer,

147
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,590
we've got to carry the bear cub and join Dr. Agasa and the others.

148
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,790
Okay.

149
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,290
What?

150
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,490
Why?

151
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,290
Hey!

152
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,890
Let's cut out this stupid cat and mouse game.

153
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,790
What do you say, Mr. Killer?

154
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,890
Killer?

155
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,490
What?

156
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,490
I figured out who the killer is

157
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,790
by decoding the mushroom message.

158
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,390
The mushrooms total 7 in all.

159
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,490
It stands for all seven of us.

160
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,690
The 3 mushrooms that are scattered stand for three kids.

161
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,990
The big Hatsutake stands for Dr. Agasa.

162
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,890
And the other three that are skewered onto the branch

163
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,890
stand for the three hunters and the rifles they are carrying.

164
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,890
I see. I get it.

165
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,390
The only poison mushroom that is skewered on is the Tengudake.

166
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,590
Which means that the killer is carrying the rifle on his right shoulder.

167
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,890
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,590
Wrong.

169
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,490
Everybody who knows the mountains well enough

170
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,090
knows that the Tengudake is a poison mushroom.

171
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,190
If the killer figures it out first,

172
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,890
then everything will go down the drain.

173
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,390
Then which is the killer?

174
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,090
Remember, I thought you how to look for mushrooms,

175
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,790
using tracking down a criminal as an example.

176
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,890
See. You've got the criminal.

177
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,390
It's the Matsutake.

178
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,390
I see.

179
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,890
Only we know about that.

180
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,790
Yeah. In other words, the killer that the code indicates is...

181
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,390
you.

182
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,780
Yeah.

183
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,880
In other words, the killer that the code indicates is you.

184
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,180
Mr. Matasaburo Saiga.

185
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,580
What?

186
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,180
The police have already found the corpse.

187
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,680
I don't have verification yet,

188
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,380
but I think it's the man with small eyes, your friend.

189
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,980
What?

190
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,180
Ai and Mitsuhiko coincidentally set foot into the scene of the crime

191
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
and found the body.

192
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,180
So, Mr. Saiga fired at them.

193
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,380
That's why Ai and Mitsuhiko figured

194
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,680
that they would be killed for having witnessed the murder.

195
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,680
Hey, gramps?

196
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,580
Hey. He's got a rifle, you know?

197
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,980
Hurry and use your anesthesia gun.

198
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,680
So, you can't take it anymore, can you?

199
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,480
Hey, Shinichi?

200
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,580
No, he didn't fire at Ai and Mitsuhiko to kill them.

201
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,280
The real reason he fired is...

202
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,280
Don't come out!

203
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,880
Hey...

204
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,780
What is that?

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
Jubei.

206
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Don't run, brat!

207
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,280
If you show your back as you flee,

208
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,180
the bear will instinctively think that you are prey.

209
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,480
Without taking your eyes off it, back off slowly.

210
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
Jubei! Don't you know me?

211
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,580
Calm your anger down and go back to the woods.

212
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,580
You've got to get ready to hibernate, don't you?

213
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,780
You'd better hurry

214
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,480
or the other bears will take away all the good caves.

215
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,580
Go on! Jubei! Go!

216
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,480
Jubei!

217
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,580
Ail! The bear cub! Give her back her cub!

218
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,380
The bear cub that is near you is probably Jubei's cub!

219
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,980
If you're carrying the cub, let it go!

220
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,780
Ai!

221
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,880
Right, Mr. Saiga fired his gun

222
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,580
in order to save Ai and Mitsuhiko

223
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,680
as well as Jubei.

224
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,780
The hunter that was killed probably tried to kill Jubei.

225
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,080
And in order to prevent that,

226
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,180
Mr. Saiga shot that hunter.

227
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Since Ai and Mitsuhiko happened to come along just then,

228
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,480
he fired a threatening shot at them before Jubei had time to notice them,

229
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,380
and them flee away from where they were.

230
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,180
The blood stain that was found near Mitsuhiko's badge

231
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,880
that was on the ground, is probably one that dripped then.

232
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,180
But, he could've told them verbally rather than fire at them.

233
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,280
Like I think you've noticed just a while ago,

234
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,580
bears are extremely sensitive beyond imagination.

235
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,380
If the two were at a distance

236
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,580
where it was hard to still hear someone shouting,

237
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,480
and if the shooter was confident about his marksmanship,

238
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,180
this would've been easier than trying to relay something verbally.

239
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,780
Isn't that right, Mr. Saiga?

240
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,180
Hey, hey, hold it.

241
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,680
We came into the mountains to hunt, you know?

242
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Why do we have to get killed for shooting a bear?

243
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,880
Moreover, it's the bear that the old man has been raving

244
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,680
about being really vicious.

245
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,380
Besides, aren't you the one who shot the eye of the bear and damaged it?

246
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,180
Yeah,

247
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,580
that's right.

248
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,980
It's the same as if I had damaged Jubei's left eye.

249
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,280
I'm alive and kicking in exchange for Jubei losing her left eye.

250
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,980
In exchange?

251
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,680
It was 20 years ago,

252
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,180
I came to this mountain was still deeply covered with snow

253
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,780
in the spring to hunt bears.

254
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,180
I slipped from carelessness.

255
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,780
I fell several meters below and broke both legs.

256
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I couldn't even utter a word,

257
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Jubei appeared before my eyes

258
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,980
when I could not budge an inch on my own.

259
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,780
I gave up thinking that I would be eaten. So, I closed my eyes.

260
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,680
That was when I felt this strangely warm thing touch my face.

261
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
I frightenedly opened my eyes.

262
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,080
Jubei was licking my wound over and over again.

263
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,380
After she finished licking every part of me,

264
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,980
of all things she fell asleep beside me.

265
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,180
Whether she was planning to eat me after getting up,

266
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,280
or whether she mistook me to be one of her kind

267
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,280
because of the black fur I was wearing, I never found out.

268
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,880
But, it was a really comforting time for me.

269
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,680
I felt so good, I almost forgot the pain in both my legs.

270
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,780
Then a gunshot echoed through the mountains,

271
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,580
and she lost her left eye.

272
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,180
She left my side.

273
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,380
A hunter that had come after her,

274
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,080
thought that she was going to eat me, and fired at her.

275
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
In other words, thanks to Jubei finding me,

276
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,280
I was rescued before freezing to death.

277
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,980
Ever since then, I came to the mountains every day to find Jubei

278
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,880
and chase her all the way deep into the mountains

279
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,280
where she wouldn't be found by other hunters.

280
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,280
Then, all that talk about Jubei being vicious...

281
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes, I was trying to keep people away from her, by scaring them.

282
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
It seems that recently what I've been doing

283
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,380
seem to be having opposite effects from what I expected though.

284
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,380
A hunter acting like a member of the humane society.

285
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,680
I feel sorry for the hunter who was shot.

286
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,780
He comes in to shoot a bear that he figures is his enemy

287
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,580
and ends up being shot by a hunter he thinks is a friend.

288
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,580
A bear is a gift from the heavens.

289
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,380
We, the bear hunters never did consider bears to be our enemy.

290
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,280
Besides, if a bear were to find me

291
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
and I unfortunately get hunted down, that too, is fate.

292
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
I will have no choice but to close my eyes.

293
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,180
But, that hunter was unforgivably unfair.

294
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,380
What are you talking about?

295
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,580
He's referring to the use of a decoy!

296
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,180
I think that the hunter used the bear cub as a decoy.

297
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,480
What?

298
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,180
The boy's absolutely right!

299
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,680
That man most likely shot one of Jubei's cubs to death

300
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,580
and lured Jubei out!

301
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,680
Morever, he hung the dead body of the cub to a tree!

302
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,680
I doubted these very eyes of mine.

303
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,080
Because while watching the mother bear

304
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,880
desperately trying to pull her cub down from the tree,

305
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
the man who had his gun aimed

306
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,380
at the mother bear looked more like a beast than she did.

307
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,080
An hour after the incident,

308
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,480
we ran into the police who was searching the mountains.

309
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,180
The elderly bear hunter was taken away by the police.

310
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,780
He walked away gazing sadly

311
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,280
at the mountains where Jubei resides.

312
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,980
I see.

313
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,380
The bear cub's grave?

314
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,680
So, that's when you figured everything out.

315
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,780
Yeah.

316
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,280
At first, I thought that Mr. Saiga killed the hunter

317
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
because he wanted to kill Jubei himself,

318
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,380
but a person like that would never make a grave

319
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,980
for a bear cub like he did.

320
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Besides, he would've been able to hunt Jubei down any time

321
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,080
since he even knew when she gave birth.

322
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,680
But, if so, why didn't he say so in the first place?

323
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,980
If he did so, Mr. Saiga would've been arrested by the police

324
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,680
and Jubei could've been killed, right?

325
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,980
But, it's amazing

326
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,680
how you figured out the bear cub was with Ai and Mitsuhiko.

327
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,880
I saw the excrement and footprints of the cub on the potato chip

328
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,880
as well as the mother bear that Ayumi was concerned about,

329
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,080
coming after her cub, too.

330
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,380
Bears usually give birth to two cubs.

331
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
If the cub that Ai and Mitsuhiko

332
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,980
brought along with them are siblings,

333
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,480
everything makes sense.

334
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm sure that Mr. Saiga was trying to stop Jubei

335
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,280
who would most likely have been outraged at having her cub killed,

336
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,180
from attacking Ai and Mitsuhiko who had her other cub with them.

337
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,180
Which means that the old man was more concerned

338
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,780
about the bear than he was of us.

339
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,080
Yeah, probably.

340
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,580
It can't be helped.

341
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,580
That man's been friends with Jubei for the past 20 years.

342
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,480
Is that so?

343
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,780
Being humane to animals

344
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,780
can be a nuisance when it comes this far.

345
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,280
But...

346
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,680
But, all is well.

347
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Because the mother and her cub were both fine.

348
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,780
I hope they find a nice place to hibernate.

349
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,280
Yes, I sure hope so.

350
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,980
What's with that look of yours?

351
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,780
Nothing.

352
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,240
