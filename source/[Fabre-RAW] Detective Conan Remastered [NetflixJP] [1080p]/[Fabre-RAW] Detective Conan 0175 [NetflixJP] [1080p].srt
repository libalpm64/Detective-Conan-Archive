1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,140
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,040
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,040
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,840
Today's crime is quite a surprise.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Using my head and chest, I will solve the case step by step.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,740
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,690
And, what is this difficult case that you need

10
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,490
the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri to help you with?

11
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,290
If it's a silly case,

12
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,390
treating me only to lunch won't do!

13
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,590
Hey... Mr. Mouri,

14
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,190
lower your voice.

15
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,890
An officer wouldn't come pick you up

16
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,490
if it were a silly case.

17
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,590
Moreover, all the way from Shizuoka, paying his own way...

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,990
As a matter of fact, Mr. Mouri...

19
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,590
About the...

20
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,690
Do you know that man?

21
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,490
Oh, no, but I have a very confidential favor to ask of you so...

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,590
Mr. Mouri!

23
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,190
About that Taiji Komiyama case...

24
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,590
Komiyama?

25
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,190
Oh, you mean that famous actor.

26
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,290
What about him?

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,490
Huh? Don't you know? He was killed 3 days ago.

28
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,690
Killed?

29
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,890
Didn't you know?

30
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,890
This case was a very incomprehensible one indeed.

31
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,990
You can't find a suspect no matter how much you investigate?

32
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,990
Just the opposite...

33
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,590
The opposite...

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,990
Three people saying that they killed him

35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,190
have turned themselves in!

36
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,990
One victim and three people who turned themselves in.

37
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,590
Very interesting...

38
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,190
"The Man Who Was Killed Four Times"

39
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,190
What do you mean by three people turned themselves in?

40
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,190
Not accomplices?

41
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,290
Well, it's not that simple.

42
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,090
Tell me about it.

43
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,190
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,290
The murder was committed 3 days ago.

45
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,590
The last day of the stage that the victim to perform,

46
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,990
2 hours before the performance began.

47
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,990
Komiyama.

48
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,390
Are you asleep, Komiyama?

49
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,490
"Hideo Tsuda (55), Actor"

50
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,890
"Taiji Komiyama"

51
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,890
Hey, I'm coming in.

52
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,390
Komiyama!

53
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,890
The victim is Taiji Komiyama, 58 years old.

54
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,190
The estimated time of death

55
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,190
is 2 hours before the victim was found.

56
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,590
It seems that he had been hit on the back of his head

57
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,390
with a blunt object.

58
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,390
The corpse was sent out immediately for autopsy

59
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,290
because homicide was suspected.

60
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,990
We also went on to question three people for testimony.

61
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,890
The three are also performers on the show, eh?

62
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,090
Yes.

63
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,890
The room Mr. Komiyama was found in,

64
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,790
is in a corner where outsiders cannot get to very easily.

65
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,990
We got testimony from the security guard,

66
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,590
the only ones who were in that area

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,390
during the victim's estimated time of death

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,590
were the three.

69
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,390
I see.

70
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,890
Mr. Kengo Katsumata

71
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,390
wanted the role that Mr. Komiyama had played

72
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,790
for the past 20 years.

73
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,590
Yumiko Niikura

74
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,590
was seriously troubled about Komiyama pestering her.

75
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,890
Mr. Haruyuki Hoshino liked Ms. Niikura,

76
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,890
and disliked Mr. Komiyama.

77
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,590
Anyway, I summoned these three to the station

78
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,490
and heard them out.

79
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,890
Then...

80
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,490
"Kengo Katsumata, Actor" -I'm very sorry,

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,590
I killed Mr. Komiyama.

82
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,590
Huh?

83
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,890
Mr. Komiyama suddenly came shouting in to the room.

84
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,990
I don't know if he was drinking, but he was a bit unsteady.

85
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,590
What's the matter, Mr. Komiyama?

86
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,490
What the heck were you reading just now?

87
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,590
What?

88
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,790
Never mind, just hand it over!

89
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,290
So, you were reading this again!

90
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,690
Listen!

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,990
This script was written for me to read!

92
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,390
I'm not ever giving my role to a half-done performer

93
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,490
like you!

94
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,990
I'm taking this to the grave with me!

95
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,690
You scum.

96
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,890
Thinking that I had to do something about the corpse,

97
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,590
I decided to drag him over to his room.

98
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,590
I thought that if I left his body there,

99
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,890
they would think his wife killed him.

100
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,890
His wife?

101
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,190
Yes, because everyone knew that Mr. Komiyama and his wife

102
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,890
weren't getting along.

103
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,290
She came to see him at his room back stage yesterday,

104
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,390
and they like always were fighting.

105
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,990
I see.

106
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,890
Darn. I wonder why

107
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,590
Komiyama suddenly came into the room shouting.

108
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,690
But then...

109
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,690
What?

110
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,590
Like I just said, I killed Komiyama with my very hands!

111
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,390
Just what do you think you're doing, barging in like that?

112
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,190
Don't you dare forget!

113
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,390
Yumiko Niikura is mine!

114
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,690
I'm not going to give her over to you!

115
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,190
You shrimp!

116
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,890
I didn't want to leave his corpse in my room.

117
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,490
So, I moved Komiyama over to his own room.

118
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,190
But, officer, thinking back on it now,

119
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,290
I feel I did something unnecessary.

120
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,090
Because I don't regret being arrested at all.

121
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,990
I did, after all,

122
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,190
rescue Yumiko from that lewd poison pest

123
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,790
with my very hands.

124
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,690
What's more!

125
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,790
What did you just say?

126
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,190
Mr. Komiyama suddenly came into my room and...

127
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,890
Please, no, Mr. Komiyama!

128
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,590
Why do you run from me?

129
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,990
We're going to be acting on the same stage,

130
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,490
I'm just trying to be friendly, Yumiko!

131
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,790
No!

132
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,490
I don't know

133
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,790
how Mr. Komiyama's corpse got back in his room.

134
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,890
But, I'm the one who killed Mr. Komiyama.

135
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,690
I'm very sorry.

136
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,190
And investigations following their questioning,

137
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,090
revealed that the vases found in all three of their rooms

138
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,290
had traces of the vases having hit the victim.

139
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,790
I have already reserved a room for you!

140
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,390
Please think it over till tomorrow morning,

141
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,690
and find us a conclusion with your sharp deduction.

142
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,890
Mr. Mouri!

143
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,790
What is this?

144
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,690
The investigation documents.

145
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,190
This much?

146
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,690
Yes!

147
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,090
Oh, is that right?

148
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,090
Huh?

149
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,090
Isn't there something strange about this picture?

150
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,190
What's so strange about it?

151
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,390
Ouch!

152
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,390
This is not something for a kid to look at!

153
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,790
But, if someone hits you on the head,

154
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,490
don't you hold your head like this?

155
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,990
This person is holding his chest, isn't he?

156
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,790
I wonder why.

157
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,090
Come to think of it, it's strange.

158
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,290
The direct cause of his death is his heart.

159
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,990
His heart?

160
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,190
As a result of the autopsy,

161
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,490
the wound of the back of his head was not that serious,

162
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,990
but he seems to have had a heart ailment.

163
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,990
According to the actor who discovered Mr. Komiyama,

164
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,190
he says that Mr. Komiyama

165
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,590
had an attack the morning he died,

166
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,190
but somehow held it down with the medication he carries around.

167
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,190
In other words, at this time,

168
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,090
when he was hit on the head,

169
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,090
it sent a shock to his heart and he passed away.

170
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,690
I guess so.

171
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,190
But, I wonder why he didn't drink his medicine then?

172
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,990
You idiot! He didn't have time to drink his medicine!

173
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,490
Well, maybe he did want to drink it,

174
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,290
but his pill case was empty.

175
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,890
Empty?

176
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,090
If he had drunk his medicine,

177
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,290
he could've held down the attack.

178
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,490
Which means that his pill box was empty from the start.

179
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,590
It can't be.

180
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,390
Please excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

181
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,890
It's from the station. I'd like to excuse myself.

182
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,190
I wonder if he'd not notice that

183
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,790
he had run out of medication that is vital to his life?

184
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,390
But, it was in fact empty.

185
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,090
The only possible conclusion is...

186
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,690
That's reckless!

187
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,690
But, department head, I understand how you feel, but...

188
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,090
Yes.

189
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,390
Why did the victim not call for help?

190
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,290
One out of three chances, eh?

191
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,790
Well, if I rack my brains over night,

192
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,090
it should be duck soup.

193
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,590
I'm sorry, sir!

194
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,390
Hey, what is this, all of a sudden?

195
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,590
You don't have one night.

196
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,590
Huh?

197
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,090
We need you to give us your deduction

198
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,490
as soon as we arrive at the scene of the crime!

199
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,690
As soon as we arrive?

200
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,690
Hey, hey, what are you going to do, Pops?

201
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,290
"Shizuoka, Citizenship Hall"

202
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,690
We've arrived.

203
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,490
Hey, Officer Yokomizo.

204
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,790
Mrs. Komiyama.

205
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,390
When on earth are going to give it back?

206
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,390
Oh, well, it is evidence, after all,

207
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,090
so we can't return it till the case is solved.

208
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,790
Then, hurry up and solve the case!

209
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,990
Who are they?

210
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,290
She is the victim's wife, Atsuko,

211
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,090
and the actor, Mr. Tsuda.

212
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,990
They look very angry.

213
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,590
Yes, they want the things that

214
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,290
the investigation headquarters have in custody,

215
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,490
are rushing me.

216
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,290
Isn't he the man that found Mr. Komiyama's corpse?

217
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,590
Yeah.

218
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,390
Just as I thought!

219
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,590
Oh, where are you going, Conan?

220
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,690
To the restroom!

221
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,590
Again...

222
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,690
Excuse me, I've got to go to the restroom too.

223
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,190
Mr. Mouri,

224
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,090
the restroom is that way.

225
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,790
Oh, I thought so.

226
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,090
On the day that he was killed?

227
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,790
Mr. Mouri of the detective office asked me to ask you.

228
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,690
The man called Komiyama had an attack that morning too, right?

229
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,090
Yeah, when he was talking to me

230
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,490
at the coffee shop in the hotel.

231
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,690
You're telling me to quit acting?

232
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,790
I'm telling you as a friend.

233
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,190
In your health condition,

234
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,690
continuing acting is like committing suicide.

235
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,090
What will there be left of me

236
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,790
if you take acting away from me?

237
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,890
Komiyama?

238
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,490
What's wrong, Komiyama?

239
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,090
Do you want me to call your wife?

240
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,790
She's in the room, isn't she?

241
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,690
It'll be fine if I take my medicine.

242
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,590
I'll drink one.

243
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,890
His attack seemed to subside as soon as he took the medicine.

244
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,190
I see.

245
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,190
I've figured out how the murder was committed.

246
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,790
As well as who the real killer is!

247
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,380
Hello,

248
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm Kogoro Mouri from the Mouri Detective Agency in Tokyo,

249
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,580
who was invited over by Officer Yokomizo.

250
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,480
There is something we would like you to check on right away.

251
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,180
You've gotta be joking.

252
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,480
I was personally asked to give you help!

253
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,280
And, you're the one who asked, right?

254
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,080
Well, absolutely.

255
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,380
I don't know how it got to the department head's ears.

256
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm so sorry!

257
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,380
So, will you please begin?

258
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,980
No way!

259
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,680
Please, Mr. Mouri, I beg you.

260
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,780
Our department head is really looking forward to you

261
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,080
solving the case too,

262
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,980
saying that he gets to hear your deduction in person.

263
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,380
That's only your side of the story!

264
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,180
Besides, you said that tomorrow would be fine, didn't you?

265
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,480
What's up, Pops?

266
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
I don't think it's nice to keep people waiting.

267
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,380
If you can't solve it, you may as well apologize right away.

268
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
You idiot!

269
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
There is no case that the renown Detective Kogoro

270
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,380
is not able to solve!

271
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,080
Okay! I'll solve it!

272
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,480
No rehearsal, it's show time!

273
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,280
I am the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri!

274
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,080
I was asked to talk about

275
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,280
the murder of Mr. Taiji Komiyama today.

276
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,080
But, I would like to first talk about

277
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,280
why I decided to pick being a detective as my profession.

278
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,080
Never mind the formalities!

279
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,480
Who of the three is the killer?

280
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,380
Huh, you mean the real killer?

281
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,880
The real killer is...

282
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,080
Well...

283
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
How should I say it?

284
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,480
-Oh, no, Dad. -The real killer probably...

285
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,280
Even your impertinent deduction is not making its appearance.

286
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,180
I was hoping that it would buy some time.

287
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
I've got no choice.

288
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,380
He's got into position,

289
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,180
he's going to start deducing, department head!

290
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,380
I've finally figured out the killer now, Officer Yokomizo.

291
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,380
If it is exactly as the three people say it is,

292
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,180
the victim Taiji Komiyama

293
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,780
would've been killed three times.

294
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,180
He entered each of your rooms back stage

295
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,480
but, the problem is the order in which he entered the rooms.

296
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,180
Mr. Kengo Katsumata's confession goes like this.

297
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,480
Mr. Komiyama came shouting into the room.

298
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,780
I don't know if he was drinking, but he was a bit unsteady.

299
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,880
That's right.

300
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,780
However, if Mr. Komiyama had a heart ailment,

301
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,580
I don't think he would've drunk until he was unsteady.

302
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,980
And, more so, if it was just before he was ready to go on stage.

303
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,280
True.

304
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,080
Then, why was he unsteady?

305
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Probably because it was after he had been punched by someone.

306
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,480
Next, according to Mr. Haruyuki Hoshino,

307
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,880
back then, Mr. Komiyama was...

308
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,380
Just what do you think you're doing, barging in like that?

309
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Don't you dare forget!

310
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,780
Yumiko Niikura is mine!

311
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,180
-Yes. -However, Mr. Komiyama

312
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,080
acts weird here too.

313
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,280
He suddenly burst into the room and pounced on Yumiko.

314
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Something must've triggered him to do so.

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,780
Yes, he made passes to you,

316
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,880
and Ms. Yumiko Niikura, you rejected him.

317
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
You already understand, don't you?

318
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,580
Mr. Komiyama approached Ms. Yumiko Niikura's room first,

319
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,680
and he was hit on the back of his head.

320
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,980
Yumiko, who thought she had killed him

321
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,280
fled from the spot.

322
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,780
However, a little while after that,

323
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,180
Mr. Komiyama regains consciousness.

324
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,380
Then...

325
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,980
He had only fainted.

326
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,580
Then, Mr. Komiyama headed for Mr. Hoshino's room,

327
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,480
thinking that Yumiko keeps rejecting him

328
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,580
because of Mr. Hoshino.

329
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,680
However, Mr. Komiyama is hit on the head there again.

330
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,080
He must've had a very hard head or something.

331
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,680
He snaps back to himself once again.

332
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,880
What a hard head.

333
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,280
Absolutely.

334
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,880
However, not learning his lesson,

335
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,080
Mr. Komiyama goes on his way again,

336
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
in order to take his anger out on someone

337
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,880
for being hit on the head twice in a row.

338
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
I see, that's why he came over to my place

339
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,780
and spitted out those rude words.

340
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,180
Then, you did it, Mr. Katsumata.

341
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,680
So, like I've been telling you from the start, I hit him.

342
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,580
No, Mr. Komiyama is more than that.

343
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,680
What do you mean?

344
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,380
When his corpse was found,

345
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,480
Mr. Komiyama looked to be holding his chest in pain.

346
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,080
Despite the fact that

347
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,680
the corpse was dragged along by Mr. Katsumata.

348
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,280
I'm sure that Mr. Komiyama's hands

349
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,680
were loosened to both sides of his body.

350
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,580
Then, why were both his hands by his chest when he was found?

351
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
There is only one answer.

352
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
Mr. Komiyama had already

353
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,980
regained his consciousness three times.

354
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,280
It was after all this

355
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,780
that Mr. Komiyama had the heart attack that took his life.

356
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,180
I see!

357
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,180
When he realized it, his medicine container was empty.

358
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,880
I wonder if there is a person who would not realize

359
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,980
that such an important thing is gone?

360
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,280
Moreover, he already took his medicine that morning too.

361
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,980
There is no reason he would not realize!

362
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,780
But, he in fact...

363
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,280
Somebody took the important medicine out

364
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
from his pill container!

365
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,180
But the victim

366
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,480
always wore the pill container around his neck.

367
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,680
The person who has access to his pill container is...

368
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,080
There is just one person.

369
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,980
After he had his attack,

370
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,580
in order to wash off his perspiration,

371
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,380
I think Mr. Komiyama took a shower,

372
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,680
isn't that right, Mrs. Komiyama?

373
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,180
He took off his precious pill container from around his neck,

374
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,580
so as not to get it wet.

375
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,680
It's true that from circumstantial evidence,

376
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,080
everything is against me.

377
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,880
However, Mr. Detective,

378
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,080
you've got no proof, right?

379
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,380
That I secretly emptied out his pill container, do you?

380
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,880
Maybe he really did forget.

381
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,580
I didn't say that you emptied it.

382
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,280
If his pill container was really empty,

383
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm sure he would've called someone for help.

384
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,280
But, he didn't do so.

385
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,580
I think

386
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,380
a different type of pill was in his pill container.

387
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,280
Just one different capsule.

388
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,580
Mr. Komiyama naturally drank the pill

389
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,180
with no suspicion what so ever.

390
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,780
However, his attack wouldn't subside.

391
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,780
After struggling for some time, he passed away.

392
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes, this is Yokomizo.

393
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,580
Stomach medicine? What do you mean by stomach medicine?

394
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,480
If I tell Mr. Mouri, he'll understand?

395
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Oh. Stomach medicine?

396
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,080
The one that I'm always drinking.

397
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,980
What on earth are you talking about?

398
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,780
I had the content of the Mr. Komiyama's pill container checked.

399
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,980
To see if there was something strange inside it.

400
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,280
Oh, so the last medicine that Mr. Yokomizo drank was...

401
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,680
stomach medicine?

402
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,180
What a fix I'm in.

403
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,580
If you guys didn't hit him in the head repeatedly,

404
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,780
the police wouldn't have stuck their nose in,

405
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,580
and he would've just died from the heart ailment

406
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,180
that he had always had.

407
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,680
That, of course

408
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,180
goes for Mr. Detective over there too.

409
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,780
Well, well, just a rumor has it,

410
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,980
you're really something, fantastic.

411
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,180
Well, not big deal.

412
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,780
When on earth did you

413
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,180
check the contents of the pill container?

414
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,080
That's... you see...

415
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,680
That, of course is business secret.

416
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,880
It's just that you don't know the answer, right?

417
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,060
"Transmitter"

419
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,440
Next time finally the Black Organization!

420
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
Conan, you aren't allowed to drink!
