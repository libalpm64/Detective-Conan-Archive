1
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:04,988
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,388
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:07,987
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:09,989
A white cup with black lingering scent.

5
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
An astounding locked room murder, an invisible murderer!

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,388
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,188
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,488
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:01,314
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 1)"

10
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,814
"24 Hours Close Up With Kogoro Mouri"?

11
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:15,214
Yes, it's aired at 9 in the morning on Monday, a golden hour.

12
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:19,214
There are many programs where we cover the daily life of police,

13
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:23,214
but this time we're focusing on a private detective.

14
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,914
"Shogo Somei (35)" -However, private detectives cannot afford

15
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,125
"President of Production Company" -to have their faces become known

16
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,114
or to have anyone figure out the way they conduct their investigations,

17
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:32,914
so we were turned down many times.

18
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:35,414
But since you're very famous, Detective Mouri,

19
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:37,514
we think that the viewers will be glued to the screen if you appear.

20
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:40,514
We would really like you to accept this offer.

21
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:44,414
But you'll be watching me for 24 hours straight, won't you?

22
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,214
Oh, if you don't want the cameras filming you,

23
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,014
just let us know and we'll do away with them.

24
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,914
"Maiko Kusumi (29)" -You can check the film before it airs

25
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:54,514
"Production Company's Employee" -and cut the ones you don't want aired.

26
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:55,814
But...

27
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,514
You haven't been getting too many job calls recently, have you?

28
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:00,914
Yes.

29
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,714
It may be a problem to film 24 hours a day because you'll be drinking beer

30
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:05,214
and listening to the horse races from morning.

31
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:08,167
And at night, you'll be playing Mahjong.

32
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,169
Don't you have work?

33
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,414
Well, I sort of don't right now.

34
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:14,814
Hey.

35
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:21,514
Well, then. Why don't you prepare something for me?

36
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:24,514
You can make up an unsolved murder case or something.

37
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,185
Wait, dad!

38
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,914
Make one up?

39
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,914
I don't think that's a good idea.

40
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:32,714
But maybe we should ask the staff anyway?

41
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,514
It doesn't have to be a murder case.

42
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,714
We could look for cases that would draw the interest of people

43
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,114
-or a troublesome situation. -No, no!

44
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:41,214
Even if it's not something we made up,

45
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:43,414
once word goes out that our staff asked him to do the job,

46
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,214
people will suspect that we made it up.

47
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,614
It would also give Detective Mouri a bad reputation.

48
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,213
Besides, considering the time we have until it's aired,

49
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,214
we don't have time to make up something like that either.

50
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:58,914
That's true.

51
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,214
Excuse me.

52
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,214
Yes?

53
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:04,714
Are you dating each other by any chance?

54
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:06,225
-What? -What?

55
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,514
You're both wearing a pair watch.

56
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:13,014
Oh, no.

57
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:17,014
This is something she gave me for my birthday.

58
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,714
I liked the design,

59
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,514
so I couldn't help getting the same watch for myself too.

60
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:25,014
Well. She has been with me right from the time the company was established

61
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,914
and has been taking care of me,

62
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:30,249
so she's like a wife to me.

63
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,261
But what a shame.

64
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,914
I was so sure that Mr. Mouri would accept the offer,

65
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:47,614
so I already made arrangements to see Mr. Nakame.

66
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:48,914
Mr. Nakame?

67
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,314
The producer of Tohto TV.

68
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:52,914
In fact, Mr. Nakame had asked me

69
00:04:52,914 --> 00:05:00,014
to take you over to his house together with the program production staff.

70
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:01,814
That's what you get for deciding things on your own

71
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:04,283
without asking me first.

72
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,914
I thought that you would immediately take the job

73
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:09,514
after seeing the name of the narrator of the program.

74
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:10,914
Narrator?

75
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:14,714
Yeah. Her name's on the planning report that I gave you a while ago.

76
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:24,014
Yoko, my dear!

77
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:29,514
Is Yoko coming to that arrangement meeting too?

78
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:32,114
Yes, of course.

79
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,914
I will gladly accept your offer!

80
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,614
Pops is a genuine simpleton.

81
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:42,321
Mr. Mouri has accepted the job.

82
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:46,114
It seems that using Yoko Okino as bait worked after all.

83
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,327
Yes, I heard that he was a fan of hers,

84
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,814
but I didn't know that he was that big of a fan.

85
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,331
Well, make sure he doesn't find out that it's a special program

86
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,333
"Raisaku Nakame (52)" -that's will be aired

87
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,914
"Tohto TV's Producer" -in place of a program that's going to be dumped

88
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,337
because of low viewer rating.

89
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,014
Yes, of course.

90
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:03,014
Mr. Mouri was all for it.

91
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:05,214
It's a program that is bound to catch the interest of the viewers

92
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:07,814
and will never be thought as a program aired in place of another program.

93
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,714
And don't forget about the other stuff too.

94
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:11,914
The other stuff?

95
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,814
The kick back.

96
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:16,355
To inflate the invoice of the production fee

97
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,114
and give me the extra cash that comes up.

98
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:20,914
We'll be making big cash.

99
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,363
Well, I refused a while ago, didn't I?

100
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:25,714
Is that so?

101
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:30,114
I thought I could work with you after your long absence. What a shame.

102
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:32,371
Wait a minute, please.

103
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,714
Well, if you hand her over to me,

104
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:38,014
I won't push things so far.

105
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,114
Her?

106
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:41,914
Maiko who works for you.

107
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:45,214
-What? -You weren't aware, were you?

108
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:47,314
The only reason I gave work to a small production company like yours

109
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,014
that was practically ousted from this world

110
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:51,914
is because she's my favorite.

111
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:54,114
I want to have an efficient girl like her

112
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:58,114
to work with me as my secretary.

113
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:01,714
Moreover, she's beautiful and has a nice figure too.

114
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,403
Well, I can't agree to that either.

115
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,314
Well, we can discuss the details

116
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:11,114
when you come over to my place with Detective Mouri.

117
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,714
Is anything wrong?

118
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,114
No, it's nothing.

119
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,614
"Somei Productions"

120
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:35,614
Yes, this is Somei Productions.

121
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:36,714
Yes.

122
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:45,814
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

123
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,814
Talk about being late.

124
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:11,314
It's more than 30 minutes past the scheduled time.

125
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:14,473
Yoko. Yoko.

126
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:18,477
Well, I guess someone doesn't seem to mind at all.

127
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,483
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mouri.

128
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,914
No problem at all.

129
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:30,114
I'll go and park the car in the parking lot then.

130
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,814
Where's my dear Yoko?

131
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:40,499
Maybe she's already at the producer's house.

132
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:44,503
His jacket was pretty wet.

133
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:50,214
What? Yoko can't come?

134
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:52,511
It seems something suddenly came up,

135
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:56,515
so the formal arrangement meeting will be set for another day.

136
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,914
None of the staff is here either today.

137
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,314
Are you all right?

138
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,314
What?

139
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:08,314
You look a bit more tired than the last time we saw you.

140
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,514
Well. I've got a lot of things on my mind.

141
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,714
"2003, Nakame"

142
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,614
No answer.

143
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:20,539
Maybe he went out somewhere because we're late.

144
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,541
I... I don't think so.

145
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,914
We've got no choice. Why don't we come back some other time?

146
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,547
Besides, Yoko's not here either.

147
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,214
Please wait.

148
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,551
Maybe something's wrong.

149
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,914
Huh? Like what?

150
00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:37,114
Well, the fact is,

151
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:40,214
Producer Nakame has been acting strange lately.

152
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,561
Remember the news some time ago

153
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:45,414
about Tohto TV's made up program scandal?

154
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:49,014
Yeah, the scandal about the travel program.

155
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:50,114
Yes.

156
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:53,914
Although Mr. Nakame had nothing to do with the scandal,

157
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,575
he felt responsible for it because he's the one

158
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,577
who started the program.

159
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:02,014
Recently, whenever he went drinking,

160
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:04,214
he would complain about it.

161
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:05,914
He said he wanted to die.

162
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:08,587
-What? -That... That's why

163
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:12,214
he might have fallen into depression again while waiting for us.

164
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:15,614
Then go and explain the situation to the condo manager right away

165
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:16,595
and get a spare key!

166
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,214
-Right this minute! -Yes, sir!

167
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,607
-Thanks for the trouble. -No problem.

168
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,314
The door's chain-locked.

169
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:34,214
It seems he's inside the room after all.

170
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:37,514
Mr. Nakame! Is anything wrong?

171
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:38,617
We've got no choice.

172
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,214
Let's cut the chain lock and go inside.

173
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,621
Will you please do it?

174
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,114
Yes, sir.

175
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,314
Mr. Nakame, we're coming in!

176
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,631
Where are the slippers?

177
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,633
You can go in with your shoes on.

178
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,214
Mr. Nakame had lived abroad for quite some time.

179
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:58,414
Oh, I see.

180
00:10:59,914 --> 00:11:02,414
I'll go check the living room on this side.

181
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:04,643
Mr. Mouri, would you please go check the study on that side?

182
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:06,914
-Okay. -Mr. Nakame!

183
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:09,714
What shall we do, Conan?

184
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,714
Should we go inside too?

185
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,814
You stay here at the front door, Ran.

186
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,814
Mr. Nakame!

187
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:17,614
What's the matter?

188
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,214
-Stay right there! -Hey, wait!

189
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:20,659
Mr. Nakame!

190
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,114
Please hang on!

191
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:27,314
Mr. Nakame! Mr. Nakame!

192
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:31,114
Hey, what's the matter?

193
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,714
I came into the living room and found Mr. Nakame on the floor.

194
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:36,214
-He's not moving. -What?

195
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,314
I smell the scent of almond from his mouth.

196
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:44,683
Cyanide poisoning.

197
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,514
He must've mixed it in his coffee and drunk it.

198
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,914
It... It's my fault.

199
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:52,714
It's all because I was late. That's why Mr. Nakame...

200
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:55,214
Stop blaming yourself

201
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,014
and call the police and ambulance right away!

202
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,314
Yes, sir.

203
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,814
Hello, is this the police?

204
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:08,707
There's a dead person.

205
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,014
Please rush over here.

206
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:14,014
The address? The address is...

207
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,715
Tohto Sky Mansion, 20th floor.

208
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:31,714
As expected, this is not suicide...

209
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,514
but it's homicide.

210
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:37,014
And the one who schemed this is probably...

211
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,114
Could it be...

212
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,109
A special program featuring a detective and staying with him for 24 hours.

213
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,109
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:55,109
In order to make arrangements for the program,

215
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,209
you came here to the TV producer's residence.

216
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,509
You rang the doorbell, and since there was no answer,

217
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:03,209
you entered the room and found the producer,

218
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:09,109
Raisaku Nakame dead after drinking the poisoned coffee.

219
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,509
Yes.

220
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,309
Since there was no answer,

221
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,109
we had the condo manager open the door for us.

222
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,775
It was chain-locked, so he cut the chain.

223
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:19,509
This is what we found when we came into the room.

224
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,781
And? You were asked to accept this job offer

225
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,309
and came to make arrangements with President Somei

226
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,609
of this program production company.

227
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,789
And the detective who unfortunately

228
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:36,795
encountered this case by accident happened to be you again, Mr. Mouri?

229
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,797
Yes, inspector.

230
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,609
Don't you think it's strange?

231
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:43,709
I mean, it's not like we're shooting a mystery series or something.

232
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,309
Why is it that you always happen to...

233
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:50,609
No, I guess I'll stop here because it's kind of ridiculous.

234
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,809
That... that's true.

235
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:57,109
So what's the cause of death? Was it due to cyanide poisoning after all?

236
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,109
As for that...

237
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,819
How was it, Tome-san?

238
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,823
I can't say much about it until the results of the postmortem are out.

239
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:08,827
But there's probably no mistake about it.

240
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:14,509
The time of death is estimated to be a little before 6.30 in the evening.

241
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:18,837
Anyway, it's amazing that you went as far as

242
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,309
to cut the chain lock of the door to get in.

243
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,409
It's because of what President Somei told us.

244
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:27,809
He said that Mr. Nakame had always thought about committing suicide,

245
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,849
so we thought it was urgent.

246
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,209
I see.

247
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:36,409
Inspector, we can't drop the possibility of this being a murder case yet.

248
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,609
What? Why not?

249
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,859
Isn't this a case of suicide

250
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,863
since the door was chain-locked from inside?

251
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:48,609
Well, it's true that this room was locked.

252
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,869
However, just because he drank poison,

253
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,509
it doesn't mean that he committed suicide.

254
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,409
Is... Is that so?

255
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:58,309
The killer could've come to Mr. Nakame's room with the cake

256
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,879
and insert poison into the coffee.

257
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,409
He then said that he had to leave because of urgent business.

258
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,883
Upon leaving,

259
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,885
the killer could've told Mr. Nakame that it's dangerous nowadays

260
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,887
to make him use the chain lock for safety reasons.

261
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,609
In that case, this situation is very easy to set up.

262
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,709
After the killer left the room,

263
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,609
all Mr. Nakame had to do was sit down and drink the poisoned coffee.

264
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,209
I see.

265
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:25,409
By the way, where were you around the estimated time of his death?

266
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,209
Are you suspecting me?

267
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,209
No, but you're the first one who found him,

268
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,911
so I'm asking just to be sure.

269
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,915
I haven't been feeling too well recently.

270
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:39,509
So, I took off from work and slept at home.

271
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,409
I got a call from Mr. Mouri just around 6.30 pm.

272
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,909
He reminded me that I was supposed to meet Mr. Nakame at 7.00 pm.

273
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:49,409
So, I came here.

274
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:53,509
I was sleeping all day, so I'm feeling a lot better now.

275
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:56,009
Hold it! Does that mean that you had forgotten

276
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,709
that we were supposed to have an arrangement meeting?

277
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,209
Yes, I'm sorry.

278
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,941
Did you pick up the call on your home phone?

279
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,943
No.

280
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,945
I picked it up on this cell phone.

281
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,947
Then, is there anyone who can prove

282
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:12,009
that you were sleeping all day in your room?

283
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,409
There isn't.

284
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,955
Proof? Are you suspecting me after all?

285
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,609
No, no. This is just for confirmation.

286
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,963
Why did you make that sound?

287
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:28,709
Strange. The bottom of the saucer of the cup...

288
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,409
Don't go touching stuff!

289
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,609
Didn't I tell you not to touch anything?

290
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:35,609
See, there are traces that coffee spilled.

291
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:36,975
What?

292
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,309
Normally, if the coffee spilled while the coffee cup was on the saucer,

293
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:43,509
there should be a circular trace of coffee on the saucer,

294
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,509
but there isn't any circular trace on this table.

295
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:50,989
All it has are two thin streaks.

296
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,993
There's no coffee underneath the saucer either.

297
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:56,409
That's true.

298
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,409
Maybe these two thin streaks

299
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:03,001
are that of the coffee cup and the handle of the cup.

300
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:07,609
If you leave the cup of coffee toppled as is,

301
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,909
the parts that touch the table

302
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:12,309
like the coffee cup and the handle won't leave traces underneath.

303
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,309
If so, after Mr. Nakame drank the poisoned coffee and fell onto the floor,

304
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,509
someone deliberately put the coffee cup back on the saucer

305
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:24,709
and placed it on the table after the coffee dried up?

306
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,025
But who would do something like that?

307
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,309
And for what reason?

308
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,109
We can't tell the reason yet,

309
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:35,309
but it's obvious who did it.

310
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,809
The only person who could've done that after the coffee dried up

311
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,041
would be the first person who entered this room and found the dead body.

312
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,409
It couldn't be anyone other than President Somei, right?

313
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:50,009
Hey, Conan. What are you saying?

314
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,509
That boy sure says strange things.

315
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,609
No. It's true that you're the only one who could do it.

316
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:59,909
It would take just about an hour for the spilled coffee to dry up.

317
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,061
The estimated time of murder is around 6.30 pm.

318
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:07,065
We entered this locked room shortly after 7.30 pm

319
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,809
or rather, before 8.00 pm.

320
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,071
So, the spilled coffee would've dried up.

321
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,209
I'm sure that you went into the room before everyone else

322
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:19,077
in order to hide evidence that you failed to erase

323
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,709
using the saucer of the coffee cup.

324
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,081
Isn't that right?

325
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,085
What kind of evidence is that supposed to be?

326
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,609
The only thing that was found underneath the saucer that the cup was on

327
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,109
was the trace of spilled coffee, right?

328
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:35,909
Why would I have to go out of my way to hide something like that?

329
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,209
The trace of the spilled coffee?

330
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,909
Hey, please let me go, Ran!

331
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,709
-Ran! -Hey! Conan.

332
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,909
No.

333
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,809
This is no ordinary murder.

334
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,709
This is an impossible crime!

335
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,123
What's the matter, Conan?

336
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,125
What's with that frightening look of yours?

337
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,609
Hey.

338
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,609
Don't you think there's something strange

339
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,131
about this spilled coffee?

340
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,409
Like I said, the saucer was...

341
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,135
It's the floor. The floor.

342
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,309
Huh? What's strange?

343
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,909
The spilled coffee went from the table to the chair.

344
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,809
Then it spilled along the leg of the chair

345
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,147
and dripped onto the carpet on the floor.

346
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,109
That's the front leg to the left.

347
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:35,609
Look slightly to the front part of the front right leg of the chair.

348
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,157
There is a round empty space around the coffee stain.

349
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,909
This shows that when the coffee spilled,

350
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:45,163
the front right leg of the chair was there, right?

351
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,509
Yeah.

352
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:48,609
Why did the chair move?

353
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:52,209
Because for some reason, he moved it

354
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:55,173
when he came into this room.

355
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,175
That's enough!

356
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,709
But isn't it strange

357
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,179
where the stain is, if he moved it

358
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,509
after the coffee dried up?

359
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,309
That's why. Take a good look.

360
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,309
First, the chair was placed this way.

361
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,709
See.

362
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,309
If you match the stain to the right front leg,

363
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,909
the stain on the other side falls out of place.

364
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,199
So that means when the coffee first spilled,

365
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,201
the chair was placed this way.

366
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:24,509
But before the coffee spilled

367
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,709
and went down the left front leg of the chair,

368
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,207
the chair moved this way, right?

369
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,209
That's true, but the chair couldn't have moved on its own.

370
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:37,209
Other person couldn't have been sitting in the chair either.

371
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:40,809
Yes.

372
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,221
This is obvious proof that when the coffee spilled,

373
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:48,209
someone was sitting on this chair.

374
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,709
Right, Pops?

375
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,309
Yeah.

376
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:54,909
Hold... Hold it there!

377
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:59,709
That means if the front door was locked and chain-locked too,

378
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,409
and all that was found in the room was the dead body,

379
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:03,709
don't tell me that...

380
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,909
It's an impossible crime.

381
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,809
It's a locked room murder.

382
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:13,251
It could be that when we entered the room,

383
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:18,409
the killer was still hiding inside, and escaped amidst the commotion.

384
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,259
I don't think so.

385
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:26,009
Because I stayed by the front door after Conan told me to do so,

386
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:30,009
but no one other than the police went through the door.

387
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,909
What?

388
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:35,009
Yes. This is an impossible crime.

389
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:37,009
A locked room murder.

390
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,609
The TV producer, Mr. Raisaku Nakame

391
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:42,709
drank poisoned coffee and was murdered.

392
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:46,009
The coffee that spilled on the table dried up,

393
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:50,809
and deception was schemed by placing a saucer under the coffee cup.

394
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,009
Based on this situation,

395
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,609
it was deduced that when Mr. Nakame drank the poisoned coffee,

396
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:58,509
the killer was no longer in the room.

397
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:00,609
The only one capable of scheming the deception

398
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:04,409
would've been Mr. Somei, the first one who entered the room.

399
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,809
However, from the coffee stain found on the floor

400
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,309
that was out of place from the position of the leg of the chair,

401
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:12,809
it became clear

402
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,609
that someone was sitting on that chair at the time the coffee spilled.

403
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,909
If that someone is the killer,

404
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,109
how did he get out of this room?

405
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,109
When we arrived at the condo,

406
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,325
the front door was locked and even chain-locked.

407
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,509
This locked room murder...

408
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:34,409
What kind of trick did the killer use?

409
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,423
"Cake"

411
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,866
-I want to eat some cake. I want it. -No, that's not the hint.

412
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,200
-I want to eat it. -Read it the other way around.

413
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,820
You mean, "ekac"?
