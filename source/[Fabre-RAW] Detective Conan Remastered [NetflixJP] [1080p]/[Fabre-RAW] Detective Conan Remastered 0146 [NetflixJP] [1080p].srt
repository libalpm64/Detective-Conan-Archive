1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,560
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,260
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,760
Today's stage is police headquarters.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,460
Officers are people, too.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,460
They are busy falling is love as well as solving cases.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,260
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,360
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,360
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,070
"Detective Love Story (Part 1)"

10
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,570
"Police Department"

11
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,970
So this is the police department!

12
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,870
It's so big!

13
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,870
This is where they are doing all the investigation of cases, right?

14
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,370
This is like the big boss of Japan's police force.

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,370
It's so exciting!

16
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,770
Come now.

17
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,470
We've been summoned here to answer questions

18
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,570
about the old blue castle we saw the other day.

19
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,470
We're not here on a picnic.

20
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,670
Conan, you were excited saying that

21
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,070
you may be able to hear about unsolved cases too, weren't you?

22
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,970
Right! The one who looked the happiest to come here

23
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,370
was none other than you, Conan!

24
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,370
Oh, is that so?

25
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,470
I'm going home.

26
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,570
You guys go on and answer their questions.

27
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,370
Hey, Ai!

28
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,170
Mr. Agasa?

29
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,370
"Wataru Takagi" -Thank you for waiting.

30
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,270
I'm Takagi of the First Investigation Division!

31
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,770
Please come in, all of you.

32
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,370
All right.

33
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,170
Thank you for coming all this way.

34
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,170
Oh, don't mention it.

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,370
It's a pretty nice place.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,770
How strange, I expected it to be dirty.

37
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,870
I bet it's just the exterior appearance that's nice.

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,970
Yes, I bet the room of the officers are...

39
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,970
"First Investigation Division"

40
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,570
There is almost no one around.

41
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,670
Everyone is out.

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,270
Is it that surprising?

43
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,570
Because all the police rooms that I've seen

44
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,270
are always filled with cigarette smoke!

45
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,170
I thought that men with scary faces

46
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,270
would be looking at me the minute I entered.

47
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,970
You've been watching too many police stories.

48
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,470
I am an officer too, you know.

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,470
He doesn't look scary at all.

50
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,570
I wonder if he can nab criminals at all?

51
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,170
I'm sure he's not popular with girls, too.

52
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,770
By the way, where is Inspector Megure?

53
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,570
He is the one who told us to come here.

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,670
The Inspector is at the Investigation Headquarters

55
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,070
working on that bank robbery case.

56
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,670
You mean that bank robbery from three days ago at Haido-cho's bank

57
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,570
where 200 million yen was robbed?

58
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,270
Yes, it seems that the Inspector's wife

59
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,670
was also at the bank at that time

60
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,070
and was hurt when she was kicked by the robber.

61
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,570
That's why the Inspector's all into this case.

62
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,770
That's why you're going to question us instead, right, Officer Takagi?

63
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,870
Yes, that's right.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,070
All right, let's get started by going to another room.

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,370
I've got another appointment at 5:00 pm.

66
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,870
It looks like the button of your sleeve is going to come off.

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,370
Oh, you're right!

68
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,570
You've got ring around the collar, too.

69
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,770
Your shirt is all wrinkled, too.

70
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,570
Don't tell me that

71
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,570
you don't have a girlfriend, Officer Takagi?

72
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,770
Would you like me to introduce you to my cousin's grandchild?

73
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,170
No way.

74
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,870
I have someone that I feel special about too, you know!

75
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,670
Officer Takagi.

76
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,070
What's with those children?

77
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,070
If they're lost,

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,370
you 're supposed to take them to the Safety Division, aren't you?

79
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,770
No, these children are...

80
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,470
What's with this lady?

81
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,670
She is...

82
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,470
Why are you blushing?

83
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,570
I get it!

84
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,570
She is the one that you like, isn't she?

85
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,170
Hey, hey...

86
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,170
Is it all right

87
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,870
to bring your girlfriend all the way to your work place?

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,670
You've got it all wrong.

89
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,670
I am Miwako Sato.

90
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,070
I may be a woman,

91
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,370
but I belong to the First Investigation Division.

92
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,070
I'm a woman officer!

93
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,170
A woman officer?

94
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,270
That's cool!

95
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,070
And what are these children here for?

96
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,570
They're witnesses of the old blue castle case.

97
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,070
What? You mean they're the ones

98
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,870
who helped with the arrest back then?

99
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,470
Yes, since the suspect confessed completely,

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,670
we had them come in for further questioning

101
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,070
to back up he confession.

102
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,370
Oh, I remember!

103
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,370
You're the one that was at the incident at the stadium, right?

104
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,470
You were so awesome back then!

105
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,570
I see.

106
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,470
The little shrimpies who were skittering here and there.

107
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,670
We weren't skittering here and there!

108
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,270
We helped with the investigation, didn't we?

109
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,770
We didn't get in your way!

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,270
That's right!

111
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,270
The Youth Detective Squad is fighting in the name of justice!

112
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,470
Is that wrong?

113
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,770
Hey!

114
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,970
True...

115
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,370
I guess we owe it to you that both cases

116
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,070
at the stadium and the old blue castile were solved.

117
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,570
But, sonny, remember this.

118
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,870
The word justice

119
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,070
is not something you should go hollering around about.

120
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,070
It's something that you keep preciously inside of you.

121
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,770
Got my message, little detective squad?

122
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,770
Yes...

123
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,470
Did I sound a bit dorky?

124
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,170
Oh, no.

125
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,570
Why are you here, Officer Sato?

126
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,670
Weren't you supposed to go with Inspector Megure

127
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,870
to the Criminal Investigation Headquarters

128
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,470
to work on the 200 million robbery case?

129
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,770
I am here to check that case out.

130
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,970
I got a call last night from the bank's branch manager

131
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,170
saying that he remembered something about the robbery,

132
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,070
so I am supposed to meet him here at 2:00 pm.

133
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,870
His wife is coming with him, too.

134
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,270
Why are both of them coming together?

135
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,370
His wife was also at the bank when the robbery took place

136
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,870
and she was held at gun point.

137
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,670
Maybe she recalled something that happened back then.

138
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,570
But that's strange.

139
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,870
I got similar phone call from her last night, too.

140
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,470
She said that she will be coming here alone at 5:00

141
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,970
because she had something to say about the robber.

142
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,470
Mr. Masuo mentioned that, too.

143
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,670
He said that

144
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,070
he didn't want his wife to be attacked by the robber again,

145
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,370
so they decided to come here together while the sun is still up.

146
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,370
Oh, I see.

147
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,670
Did you hear anything from Yumi from the Traffic Department?

148
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,170
I seem to have got drunk last night

149
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,470
and gave her a bad time.

150
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,270
But I don't remember a thing.

151
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh, no. I haven't heard a thing.

152
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,270
Officer Takagi, hear me out, will you?

153
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,470
I got Miwako drunk and heard from her

154
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,670
that she has somebody she likes

155
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,770
in the First Investigation Division after all!

156
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,070
Maybe it's you, you know?

157
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,270
Oh, you lover boy!

158
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,370
Officer Sato!

159
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,470
The branch manager of Tohto Bank is here!

160
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,770
Thank you for coming. This way please.

161
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,370
"Keizo Masuo (53)"

162
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,470
I seem to have made it in time.

163
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,870
Huh? Wasn't your wife supposed to come here with you?

164
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,570
I had some matters to attend to at the bank,

165
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,070
so I'm supposed to be meeting her here.

166
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,570
Isn't she here yet?

167
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,570
No.

168
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,170
Strange...

169
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,570
I wonder if she's still asleep?

170
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,570
May I borrow your phone?

171
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,870
Go ahead.

172
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,170
It's the third time.

173
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,070
Huh? What is?

174
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,770
The number of times he looked at his wristwatch.

175
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,570
Yes, this is the Masuo residence.

176
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,170
Oh, it's you.

177
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,970
What? You're at the police station?

178
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,670
Yes, I'll put the officer on.

179
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,770
Hello, this is Officer Takagi.

180
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,970
"Kayo Masuo"

181
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,170
You're the officer I talked to last night.

182
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,870
Officer Takagi, was it?

183
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,270
Yes. You still seem to be at home...

184
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,070
Is anything the matter?

185
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,270
Huh? What do you mean?

186
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,070
I'm supposed to meet you at 5:00, aren't I?

187
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,770
Your husband says that he has changed the schedule

188
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,070
and has decided to come here with you at 2:00 pm.

189
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,670
He didn't tell me about it!

190
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,870
You haven't heard?

191
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,970
Hey! Just what are you talking about?

192
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,870
Give it to me!

193
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,270
Hello, Mrs. Masuo?

194
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,670
Please answer me, Mrs. Masuo.

195
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,670
What's the matter?

196
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,370
Officer Takagi, get the officers ready for standby!

197
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,870
I'll go and get the car!

198
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,070
Okay!

199
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,570
Officers?

200
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,370
The troops that are dispatched at the start of a case

201
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,670
to carry out investigations.

202
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,270
Isn't that right, Conan?

203
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,770
Where is Conan?

204
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,970
Beats me.

205
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,370
I wonder if my wife's okay?

206
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,570
Have you noticed anything unusual happen around you recently?

207
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,270
Anything unusual?

208
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,570
Come to think of it...

209
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,470
My wife said that a strange man was loitering near our house!

210
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,270
There's a possibility that

211
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,670
one of the robbers came to shut her up

212
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,670
thinking that she saw his face!

213
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,070
No... no way!

214
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,570
But there's still a possibility

215
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,270
that she just screamed at seeing a burglar or something.

216
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,470
If it were a burglar,

217
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,870
I think she would've said

218
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,770
that the phone is connected to the police!

219
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,070
When did you get in?

220
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,070
What shall we do?

221
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,570
We don't have time to take him back!

222
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,870
Making sure that his wife is safe is our first priority!

223
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,670
Don't bite your tongue, sonny!

224
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,870
Huh?

225
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,470
Hey, Kayo!

226
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,270
Officers, please check upstairs.

227
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,470
I'll go check the living room!

228
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,670
Let's go, Officer Takagi!

229
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,770
Okay!

230
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,970
The glass was cut.

231
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,070
Did someone come in from outside?

232
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,070
What's the matter?

233
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,970
Kayo...

234
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,870
Mrs. Masuo!

235
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,370
I will go get an ambulance!

236
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,570
No, call the investigation squad,

237
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,870
the criminal investigation officers and the coroner.

238
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,370
She's already dead.

239
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,170
No... no way.

240
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,670
Will you give me the time?

241
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,670
14:46, corpse is found!

242
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,170
Who on earth would do something cruel like this?

243
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,970
Did the robber back then kill her after all, officer?

244
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,470
Strange...

245
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,970
He should've seen the corpse of his wife

246
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,770
as soon as he entered this living room door.

247
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:43,870
But he didn't raise a voice until I went over by the window

248
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,370
and realize that the window was cut open.

249
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,170
I wonder why.

250
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,470
I wonder if you'd usually attack someone who is on the phone?

251
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,570
Your voice may accidentally be heard over the phone,

252
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,870
and besides, it's more than obvious

253
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,370
that the person on the other side of the phone

254
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,170
will rush over here.

255
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,970
His incomprehensible remarks and actions

256
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,370
at the police station also bother me.

257
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,770
Don't tell me that the person who set this murder up is...

258
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,070
It can't be...

259
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,460
The victim is Mrs. Kayo Masuo, age 42.

260
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,560
The murder weapon

261
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,460
is the knife that is poked into the middle of her back.

262
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,860
She doesn't seem to have put up a fight,

263
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,160
and she probably died on the spot.

264
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,960
The estimated time of death

265
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,660
is probably just about the time she screamed.

266
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,260
Officer Sato, did you hear her scream?

267
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,860
The victim's husband called her from the police station

268
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,060
and was talking to her.

269
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,160
Then, I happened to accidentally press the monitor button.

270
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,660
It was at that time

271
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,260
that we heard her scream over the phone.

272
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,060
Which means that the victim

273
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,060
was attacked from behind while she was on the phone, right?

274
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,960
I don't think she was only on the phone.

275
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,260
-What? -What?

276
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,460
She was pedalling the aero-bike while talking on the phone.

277
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
And...

278
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,760
Look!

279
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,360
She's perspiring and her shirt is a little damp, too.

280
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,260
When people die, their body metabolism stops.

281
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,660
So even if the room temperature rises, they don't perspire.

282
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,060
And if they were perspiring,

283
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,160
it doesn't dry up until after some time.

284
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,360
Which means that she must've been doing something

285
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,360
that made her perspire until she was killed, right?

286
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,160
When I looked a while ago in the shoe box,

287
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,860
there were no jogging shoes.

288
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,960
The only thing in this house that can make a person perspire

289
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,760
is the aero-bike that is near the corpse.

290
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Hey! You're not supposed to be fooling around

291
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,760
at the crime scene.

292
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,460
You're pretty good, aren't you?

293
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,860
Sonny, I haven't got your name yet.

294
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,260
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective!

295
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,160
A detective?

296
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,560
He's the boy that Detective Mouri is looking after, you see.

297
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,160
I see! That's why you know all these things.

298
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,960
Then, sonny, be a police detective when you grow up.

299
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,560
If you're ever put on duty here,

300
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,760
we'll be kind and take good care of you.

301
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,860
Right, Officer Takagi?

302
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,260
Yes!

303
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,060
Officer Sato, we'll go ask around

304
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
and see if there are any witnesses in the neighbourhood.

305
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,960
We'll have to scrutinize inside this house, too.

306
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Robbery hasn't been ruled out yet either.

307
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Yes, madam!

308
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,960
No, this is not the work of an ordinary robber.

309
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,460
From my point of view, the killer

310
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,860
was after Mrs. Masuo's life in the first place.

311
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,460
Assistant Inspector Shiratori.

312
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
I'm no longer assistant inspector.

313
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,660
"Ninzaburo Shiratori" -I've been promoted...

314
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,160
to Inspector as of today.

315
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,960
So, I'm going to be taking charge of this case.

316
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Oh, my. How lucky.

317
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,360
You guys in the career group get promoted so quickly.

318
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
If it's okay with you, will you put me on the list

319
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,560
of candidates wanting to be your future wife?

320
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,460
Yes, of course. It'd be my pleasure.

321
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,160
Huh?

322
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,560
Don't tell me that the person Ms. Sato likes...

323
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,160
is Mr. Shiratori?

324
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
No good!

325
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,960
What a thing to think about while still on duty!

326
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,860
And do you have any proof that this is not a robbery?

327
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,960
The victim screaming

328
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,860
which you said you heard over the phone.

329
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,560
A robber would normally

330
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,060
not attack a person who is on the phone.

331
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,660
And besides, if he is seen as well as screamed at,

332
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,060
the more natural it would be for him to flee.

333
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,660
Wasn't the victim supposed to come to the police station today

334
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,060
to testify?

335
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,060
Yes, she said she remembered something about the robbery,

336
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,160
so she was supposed to come to the station today with her husband.

337
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,760
But since she didn't show up at the scheduled time,

338
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,360
her husband got worried and called here on the phone.

339
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,060
Didn't the victim say anything

340
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,560
to hint that she was talking to the police?

341
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,160
She did.

342
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,560
When I got on the phone, she said,

343
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,760
"You're the officer I talked to last night."

344
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,960
Then, there is no doubt!

345
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,260
The killer killed her during the phone conversation

346
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,560
because he didn't want her to talk to the police.

347
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,960
Wait. Do you mean that...

348
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes, the killer was probably one of the bank robbers.

349
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,560
The victim was held at gun point at that time,

350
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,960
and got really close to one of them.

351
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,060
The robber probably thought that she had seen his face,

352
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,960
and killed her to keep her from talking.

353
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,860
And besides, it seems that the victim struggled viciously

354
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,560
and even pulled at the mask of the robber, too.

355
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,460
Yes, not being able to handle her,

356
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,460
he grabbed Inspector Megure's wife who walked into the bank

357
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,060
and took her hostage instead.

358
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,160
Rather, it was Mrs. Megure who offered to become a hostage.

359
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,160
I remember my wife saying something last night about a foreigner.

360
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,260
That's it!

361
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,860
Mrs. Masuo probably wanted to tell us

362
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,460
about that characteristic of the robber!

363
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,860
Officer Takagi! Call the Special Investigation Headquarters

364
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,060
and tell them that one of the robbers

365
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,260
have been specified as being a foreigner!

366
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,860
Oh, okay.

367
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
But isn't it strange?

368
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,760
See, the rear of the aero-bike is only two meters high.

369
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,860
I wonder how she was attacked from behind

370
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,160
while she was riding the aero-bike

371
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,960
when there is no door behind her?

372
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,560
So, it's you again.

373
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, do you know him?

374
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,760
Yes.

375
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,560
He is the little detective who often tag along with Mr. Mouri.

376
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,260
So you're quite famous, aren't you?

377
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,060
What's wrong, Officer Takagi?

378
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,560
No, it's nothing.

379
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,460
Don't you think it's strange too, officers?

380
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,460
But, sonny, just because she was stabbed in the back,

381
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,360
it doesn't mean that she was attacked from behind.

382
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,460
There are cases when the victim tries to run from the killer

383
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,960
and gets stabbed in the back, too.

384
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
If so, the corpse would be lying farther away

385
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,260
from the aero-bike, wouldn't she?

386
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,460
The phone is on the floor near her, too.

387
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,360
If she fell somewhere else,

388
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,060
there should be perspiration stains there, too.

389
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,460
Lastly, there would be no reason for the killer

390
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,560
to move her body all the way near the aero-bike, right?

391
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,660
That is true.

392
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,560
Mr. Masuo, did your wife always use the aero-bike?

393
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,160
Yes. It was her daily routine to pedal the aero-bike

394
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,660
at 2:00 pm everyday.

395
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
I don't want to get personal,

396
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,660
but what time do you both usually get up in the morning?

397
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,060
Since I work at the bank,

398
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,160
I leave the house in the morning.

399
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,460
But since my wife has recently been going drinking

400
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,960
until late at night with her friends,

401
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,760
I think she always slept until noon.

402
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,560
Then, the answer is quite simple.

403
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,160
If my deduction is correct,

404
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,060
the killer was probably...

405
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,960
hiding behind this curtained bookshelf!

406
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,460
What?

407
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,360
Oh, how convenient.

408
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,860
There are not many books in here.

409
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,560
It's a great hiding place.

410
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,160
What an empty bookshelf.

411
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
The curtain of that shelf is dark beige,

412
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,260
unlike the other curtains in this room.

413
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,760
We just moved that shelf there

414
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,860
when we redid the interior of this room.

415
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,360
We were planning to change the other curtains to that color soon.

416
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,260
I wonder if a person can hide in a place like that?

417
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,460
If two of the shelves are removed,

418
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,660
it'd easily fit an adult inside.

419
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,760
In other words, this is what the killer did...

420
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,760
After checking Mr. Masuo's activities beforehand,

421
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,160
the killer snuck into the house right after Mr. Masuo left.

422
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,860
And right before Mrs. Masuo gets up,

423
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,460
he breaks into the house

424
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
and hid behind this book shelf,

425
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,660
waiting for chance to kill her.

426
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,860
For the moment when she would get on the aero-bike

427
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,960
and vulnerably turn her back towards him.

428
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,660
But when the time finally came, his plan were foiled slightly.

429
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,560
Becasue just then, she receives a call from the police.

430
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,160
The killer who panicked dashed out from the bookshelf

431
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,460
and carried out his plan.

432
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,460
The killer got in from the window by the corridor that was cut open.

433
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,260
True. Mr. Masuo had also mentioned that

434
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,860
his wife said a suspicious man was loitering around their house.

435
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,560
It's not strange that the killer should know

436
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,760
the habits of the victim as well as the layout of the room.

437
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,060
No.

438
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,660
There is a big loophole in that deduction.

439
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,060
I'm positive that he is the killer.

440
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,960
There must be a way to kill his wife from the police station

441
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,660
that is located several kilometres away.
