1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,334
In our search to find out whether Eisuke Hondo's older sister

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,934
and Rena Mizunashi, were one and the same person,

3
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:10,934
we found out that Rena Mizunashi's blood type was AB.

4
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:13,993
I'm blood type AB!

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:16,334
On the other hand, Eisuke tells us that he is blood type O,

6
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:19,434
and from the mansion where his mother used to work as a housekeeper.

7
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:22,001
A mother-child booklet that was found, confirmed Eisuke's blood type too.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,334
It's written here, see?

9
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:27,734
Eisuke Hondo, blood type O!

10
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:29,634
True.

11
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:32,034
So, now everyone knows that I'm blood type O!

12
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:33,234
I see.

13
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,834
So, all that's left now is to verify the story about

14
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,034
whether his older sister really gave him blood for transfusion.

15
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,434
The son of the Okudaira's

16
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:45,034
had been killed by someone a year ago.

17
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:50,029
And this is the print out of the video we were watching back then.

18
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:53,034
Both his legs are tied and his mouth is covered with masking tape.

19
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,234
Talk about terrible.

20
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,134
Do you have any idea of anyone

21
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:59,534
who could've had a grudge against your son?

22
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,734
An idea of anyone,

23
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:04,634
not outside, but rather inside this house.

24
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,051
This is what I think, Detective Mouri.

25
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:14,434
My son Tango

26
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:18,434
was killed by a sly and clever someone...

27
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:23,534
who lives in this mansion.

28
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,134
Sizzling hot suspense.

29
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:52,091
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

30
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,093
A surprising truth that is revealed through blood type!

31
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,734
Echoing through the mansion are screams and shrieks!

32
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,097
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,099
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,434
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:36,195
"Red and Black Crash: A Shriek"

36
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:41,715
Your son was killed by someone in this house?

37
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,215
But, didn't you say that

38
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:47,315
while everyone in the house

39
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:50,209
was watching the video in the living room,

40
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,211
your son was drowned and killed in the pool

41
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,715
outside your house by someone!

42
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,215
"Kakuzo Okudaira (63), Head of Okudaira Family"

43
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:02,221
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death of your son

44
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:05,315
was between 9:00 to 10:00 at night.

45
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:06,615
All the way before and after that time span,

46
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:09,915
that is, from 7:00 pm to 12:00 pm,

47
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,615
all of you were watching video, is that right?

48
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,239
That's true.

49
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,915
But, I'm sure that Tango was killed by someone in this house.

50
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,715
I can't help thinking so!

51
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:31,415
Do you have a hidden door or something in the living room?

52
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,815
And do you think that someone slipped out from there?

53
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,255
No, there is no such door.

54
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,415
But, there was someone who stood up to go to the restroom

55
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:40,515
-while we were watching the video. -I see!

56
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,261
So, someone snuck outside during that time.

57
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,263
Not possible either.

58
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,265
The restroom is connected to the living room,

59
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:49,015
and the window of the restroom is too small

60
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:51,515
for an adult to go through.

61
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,115
Then, it would be impossible for anyone inside

62
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:55,015
to have committed the crime.

63
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:56,915
But, take a good look!

64
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,515
Over here in the picture!

65
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:04,283
See, Tango's right hand. He's wearing a white glove.

66
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,015
Yes.

67
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,615
That's the glove that the steward that used to work here before

68
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:14,293
used to always wear when he drove!

69
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:20,615
But he died two years ago today, when his car fell over a cliff.

70
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,315
Today, you mean

71
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:32,815
on the same day a year ago, when your son was murdered?

72
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:35,415
Right, today.

73
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:38,115
And three days after my son's death,

74
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:40,715
the left side of the glove that belonged to the steward

75
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,215
was found in my study.

76
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:46,015
I see! You mean the glove that the killer

77
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:49,815
tried to put on your son's hand, for some reason came off.

78
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,715
No! Wrong!

79
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:55,615
Somebody has a grudge against the death of the previous steward!

80
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:57,215
A grudge?

81
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,339
Didn't the steward die of an accident?

82
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,341
No...

83
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:04,343
You mean someone thought that

84
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,715
you and your son were responsible for the death of the steward?

85
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:11,815
The killer made your son wear the steward's glove

86
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:14,353
then later put the glove of this other hand in this room

87
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:18,715
to warned you that you were next in line to be killed.

88
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:21,615
That's what you wanted to say, right, sir?

89
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,615
Yeah.

90
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,615
What's with you guys?

91
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,515
Coming in without permission!

92
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:30,369
Conan suggested that we come to hear about the case,

93
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,115
since we finished what we had to do.

94
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,115
Cut out that stupid chuckle of yours!

95
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:38,915
If you're done with what you have to do, go on home!

96
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:52,391
It's been a long time, Uncle Kakuzo.

97
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,215
Oh, it's you, Eisuke!

98
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:58,397
I hear that your mother's belongings were found.

99
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:02,401
Yes! I got them all thanks to everyone.

100
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:06,405
Your mother was a fantastic housekeeper.

101
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:10,415
She was very thoughtful and always smiling.

102
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,411
I'm so sorry that

103
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:16,415
I'm not thoughtful and not amiable on top of that.

104
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,715
Oh, no, I didn't mean it to sound that way.

105
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:24,115
By the way, I heard that Tango passed away.

106
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:29,815
Yeah, I'm having Detective Mouri check on it for me now.

107
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,815
-Mr. Segawa. -Yes, sir.

108
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:35,815
Please show Detective Mouri to the living room.

109
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:38,215
Yes, sir, Mr. Okudaira.

110
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,615
And, Kikuyo, could you get us another serving of coffee?

111
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,415
-Yes, sir. -And, could you also

112
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,815
go get Mrs. Okudaira while you're at it?

113
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:49,315
I want her to help me organize this study.

114
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,215
Will you all come and help me too,

115
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,815
once you've finished doing what you have to?

116
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:55,715
I've got something I'd like to talk to you about too.

117
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:58,115
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,459
Oh, and Segawa.

119
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,715
Yes?

120
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,915
I've told you time and again

121
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:08,015
to knock before coming into my room!

122
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:11,815
Haven't you informed the guests, you blockhead?

123
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:14,473
I'm very sorry.

124
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:22,481
What? Help organize the study?

125
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,015
No way!

126
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:29,015
He's so detailed and so hung up complaining about petty things.

127
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:31,215
But, Mrs. Okudaira...

128
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:33,915
Even just a while ago, when I tried to open

129
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:36,515
the cardboard box with a set of large books inside that arrived today,

130
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,115
he bawled me out,

131
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,815
telling me not to touch it until he opened it!

132
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,015
He changed the shelf of the bookshelf

133
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,615
in order to fit the large books in.

134
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:49,815
We consequently ended up moving almost all the books,

135
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:53,315
and now he wants help organizing it again?

136
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,615
But...

137
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,815
Let's do this, then!

138
00:08:57,815 --> 00:09:01,315
I'll show Detective Mouri to the living room,

139
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:03,015
so you go ahead and help my husband.

140
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:08,215
But, I've got to clean Tango's car too.

141
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,115
No one has been using that car for the past two years,

142
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,533
so why not just leave it as is?

143
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,315
But, Mrs. Okudaira...

144
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,915
Come along, this way.

145
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,915
Since you can wash the car later,

146
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:23,615
-do so for me, okay? -Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,915
Please come this way.

148
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,315
Is this the living room in question?

149
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,815
Yes.

150
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:34,553
Back then, my husband, the steward, the housekeeper and I

151
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:37,315
were all here watching the video.

152
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,115
We watched the video of my husband and I taking a trip abroad

153
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:42,561
for approximately five hours straight.

154
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,815
Why didn't your son watch the video together?

155
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:50,015
Most probably because he was trying to avoid me.

156
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:53,715
I'm not his real mother.

157
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:54,573
Is that so?

158
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:58,915
No, Tango is the son of my husband's previous wife.

159
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:01,015
Haven't I told you?

160
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:04,583
But, is my husband really suspecting us?

161
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,815
Yes.

162
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:10,315
How dare he suspect us just because the killer can't be found?

163
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:12,915
My husband sure is a pain in the neck.

164
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,115
The living room restroom.

165
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:22,601
Sure has a window that adults could never go through.

166
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:24,215
Moreover, there is no secret hole

167
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:28,015
where someone cannot go in and out of in this living room.

168
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,215
If so, the four that were watching the video here,

169
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,015
would have a perfect alibi.

170
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,215
It really came as a surprise to me, though,

171
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,515
that you, Eisuke who used to be such a cry baby

172
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:41,515
has come here with such a cute girlfriend.

173
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,415
Oh no, we're not.

174
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:47,615
Not lovers or anything like that!

175
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:54,415
We came here to find out what Eisuke's blood type is,

176
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,637
since we were told that his mother-child booklet was found!

177
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:02,015
Right, Eisuke?

178
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,715
Yep.

179
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:06,215
Why the blood type?

180
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,647
Well, when I showed Mr. Mouri the picture of my older sister,

181
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:12,415
he said that it may be Rena Mizunashi,

182
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:15,015
so I came to clear the fact that she isn't.

183
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,815
This announcer, Rena Mizunashi is blood type AB,

184
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,415
but my blood type is O.

185
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:22,661
I once receive blood transfusion from my older sister so,

186
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,815
I know that she and the announcer are two different people!

187
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:29,415
Eisuke knew about it.

188
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:32,671
Come to think of it, I remember that there was something like that.

189
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,915
If I remember correctly, soon after your mother passed away

190
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,515
and you went to live with your father in Osaka,

191
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,681
you got into an accident.

192
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,015
After hearing what happened, I rushed over

193
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:50,215
and saw your older sister lying exhausted beside you.

194
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,415
I asked the nurse, and found out

195
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:02,115
that you had a large amount of blood transfusion from your sister.

196
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:04,115
I heard that she said, she didn't mind

197
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:06,115
if they took all the blood they could get from her,

198
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:07,815
and give it to you.

199
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:11,815
I see.

200
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,713
So, this does it.

201
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:18,015
His older sister and Rena Mizunashi

202
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:20,315
are two different people.

203
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:31,626
I don't watch much TV but, do they resemble each other that much,

204
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,126
his older sister and that woman?

205
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:36,735
Yes, from the picture, they look exactly alike.

206
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,426
But, don't you think it's strange?

207
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,026
I mean it's not like this is a doppelganger phenomenon or something.

208
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,426
It's unbelievable to think that there's someone

209
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,743
who looks so much alike in this world.

210
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:47,526
I wonder if it has anything to do with the disappearance of my sister?

211
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,726
-What do you think? -Beats me.

212
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,426
I see.

213
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,926
He's going to get her suspicious enough

214
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,826
and lead uncle to check things out, then disclose her crime.

215
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,626
After that, he plans to meet Rena Mizunashi

216
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:01,826
and ask her about his older sister.

217
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,726
He doesn't want to risk her fleeing,

218
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,765
so he wants to take it slow.

219
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,126
Would you like to go see her, then? In fact, I know where her...

220
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:12,771
Please show me the pool while we're at it.

221
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:16,426
We may find something out about Tango.

222
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,426
I guess so.

223
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:22,226
Oh, but... it's raining outside.

224
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:25,226
Oh, Kikuyo,

225
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:26,785
have you been out somewhere?

226
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,789
Yes, I ran out of milk for the coffe,

227
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,791
so I went shopping nearby.

228
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,326
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

229
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,326
Would you show everyone to the pool?

230
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,126
I'll serve the coffee.

231
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:42,226
Yeah, I don't mind.

232
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:44,026
Take care of them, okay?

233
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:45,326
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:54,226
Talk about dirty.

235
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:57,526
Yes. It's been left the way it's been

236
00:13:57,526 --> 00:14:00,126
since the incident that occurred last year.

237
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,426
But, how nostalgic.

238
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,826
I used to swim in this pool a lot too.

239
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,126
Hey, Eisuke?

240
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:16,026
Oh, boy. I mean talk about being a klutz.

241
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,426
My, it's just right.

242
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,726
I'm sorry. The only clothes of the same size

243
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,426
that I could find were that of my late son.

244
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,526
No problem.

245
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:33,826
Which means that your son was of small build too?

246
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,826
It's a little too big for me.

247
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:37,626
Yes.

248
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,126
Tango used to do body building.

249
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,526
I put your clothes in the washing machine just now,

250
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:44,026
so please wait a while.

251
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,426
Oh, Kikuyo,

252
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,726
there was no coffee in the kitchen.

253
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:49,426
Oh?

254
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:53,326
I left it on the coffee maker and went shopping.

255
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,873
Oh, Mr. Segawa.

256
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:55,826
Yes?

257
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:57,926
Do you know where the coffee in the kitchen is?

258
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:58,877
No.

259
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:02,881
Maybe Mr. Okudaira couldn't wait and came to get it himself.

260
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,885
What was that sound?

261
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,226
I wonder if it came from Mr. Okudaira's study?

262
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,526
I'll go check.

263
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,826
Yes, please.

264
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:14,626
Maybe it's that huge vase that we saw a while ago.

265
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:17,426
No way. That vase is something Mr. Okudaira

266
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:20,899
had valued since long ago, and it's worth 50,000,000 yen,

267
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:25,726
A black out?

268
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,526
Don't open the door!

269
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:31,726
What was that?

270
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,226
Dear!

271
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:54,026
-It can't be! -What happened to him?

272
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,426
-Dear! -Mrs. Okudaira,

273
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,926
shattered pieces of the vase are still on the floor!

274
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,626
Are you all right?

275
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,726
Yes.

276
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,945
Dear.

277
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,726
Let's get him down right away!

278
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:09,826
-Yes, sir! -Ran!

279
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:12,426
Contact the police and call an ambulance!

280
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,226
Okay, right away!

281
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,726
Darn, what's with this rope? It won't come off.

282
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:40,026
The mouth of the vase...

283
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:41,926
is wet?

284
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:49,426
I'm sorry to say that

285
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:54,626
your husband was already dead when he arrived at the hospital.

286
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,626
Oh no!

287
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,926
Mrs. Okudaira.

288
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:06,026
Mrs. Okudaira. Here, take this.

289
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,226
Thank you.

290
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:13,526
I'd like to ask you a few questions, ma'am.

291
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:18,226
Who was the first to find him?

292
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:21,019
Oh, yes. The first two who found my husband

293
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,326
were Kikuyo and Mr. Segawa, right?

294
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:29,026
Yes, we heard something crack from the study,

295
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:31,726
so we rushed over and knocked

296
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:33,326
but there was no answer.

297
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:35,926
Since he didn't answer,

298
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:38,026
I tried turning the door knob.

299
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,626
But then, I heard him shout, "Don't open the door!"

300
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,426
Oh, and did you open the door?

301
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,043
Of course I did,

302
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,826
because I couldn't make out what was happening.

303
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,047
Then, when we opened the door,

304
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,126
we found Mr. Okudaira's body suspended in the air.

305
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:56,526
Which means that the man hung himself just before you opened the door?

306
00:17:56,526 --> 00:18:01,426
Yes, his body was still swaying.

307
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:03,726
The window is locked tightly

308
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:05,526
so it looks to be he committed suicide but...

309
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:08,726
But, I wonder why he shouted, "Don't open the door?"

310
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:13,071
I'm sure he didn't want anybody to witness him die.

311
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:17,075
It seems that Mr. Okudaira got sick and tired of this world

312
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,726
and decided to take his life.

313
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,026
You again.

314
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:23,426
Please take a look, Inspector,

315
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:26,726
at the shattered pieces of the vase on the floor!

316
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:30,726
This was indeed the sound of something cracking that everyone heard!

317
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,826
Moreover, this is the vase that he treasured most,

318
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,093
worth 50,000,000 yen!

319
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,726
50,000,000 yen! Is that true?

320
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:38,826
Yes.

321
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,626
My husband used to boast that

322
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:43,926
it is valued at over 200,000,000 yen now.

323
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:47,626
The fact that he used the vase as a stepping stool to hang himself

324
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,326
is just proof that he got sick and tired of everything.

325
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:53,111
However, the result of the autopsy showed that

326
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:57,426
coffee as well as a sleeping drug were found inside his stomach.

327
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,626
Coffee?

328
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,826
Huh? You mean that?

329
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,526
There are two cups there!

330
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,126
One is mine.

331
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,126
But, would a person who is ready to hang himself

332
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:08,626
drink coffee with sleeping pills in it?

333
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,926
Maybe he planned to kill himself

334
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:13,526
taking an overdose of sleeping pills at first,

335
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:17,726
but found that he couldn't die, so he switched methods.

336
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:20,926
He glued the rope on together carefully the second time around,

337
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,426
so that it wouldn't come off.

338
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:23,726
Glue?

339
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:27,145
Yes, I was wondering why the rope wouldn't come off right away

340
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,426
when I tried to bring Mr. Okudaira down,

341
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:31,726
and found that glue was on the connecting parts of the rope.

342
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,926
What was his motive for committing suicide?

343
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:38,026
Do you have any idea?

344
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:39,157
No.

345
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,326
Come to think of it, he said to come to his study later

346
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:45,163
because he wanted to talk something over,

347
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:49,167
so maybe he had something that was bothering him.

348
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:53,171
Then, why would he hang himself before he talked to all of you about it?

349
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,626
Maybe he thought it was useless even if talked to us about it?

350
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,626
I hate to say this,

351
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:03,181
but I don't think Mr. Okudaira trusted any of you.

352
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,926
Your husband was probably bleeding from the mouth

353
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:10,226
because he bit his lip in vexation.

354
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,826
I'll bet he didn't like the idea of his favourite vase,

355
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,193
being owned by someone else after his death.

356
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,926
That's why he used it as a step and cracked the vase by stepping on it.

357
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:24,026
-So, that man was really greedy after all. -What?

358
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,526
Because if the man stepped on the vase to hang himself

359
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,626
and the sound of the vase cracking was heard,

360
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,926
that means the man was already choking at that time, right?

361
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,211
He must've been really greedy because he was able to shout,

362
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:37,215
"Don't give the vase to anyone" despite being choked.

363
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:41,726
Wrong, Conan.

364
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:44,626
He didn't shout don't give the vase away, he said don't open the door.

365
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,426
Oh, did he?

366
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,726
Come to think of it, isn't it strange?

367
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,926
How could he have shouted when he was being choked?

368
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:57,235
Which means that when the vase cracked he hadn't hung himself yet.

369
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:01,026
Which means that he hung himself from the shock of the vase cracking?

370
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,526
No, if they heard the sound of the crack and ran over,

371
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,626
he wouldn't have had enough time to hang himself with the rope.

372
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:09,026
Oh, maybe it's because of this?

373
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,926
See, this book is stained with blood.

374
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:15,826
I'll bet he was disappointed because it was a book he treasured.

375
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,426
"Murderer from the Land of the Dead?"

376
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:23,261
It's located right below Mr. Okudaira's feet.

377
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,326
Huh?

378
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:32,326
Could this by chance be a dying message?

379
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:34,326
Don't be ridiculous.

380
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,126
Are you saying that the killer is a ghost

381
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:38,126
who came from the Land of the Dead?

382
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:42,626
Oh, no, I think that the message is

383
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:45,283
where the word Land of the Dead is, because there's a lot of blood there,

384
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,826
and because of the hiragana "ko"

385
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:50,926
that seems to have been written by dripping blood.

386
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,026
Land of the Dead, (pronounced "yomiko")

387
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,226
Ko... Koyomi?

388
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,226
Does it have anything to do with a date?

389
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:59,626
No, I'm not really sure yet if this is the letter "ko".

390
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,626
If you change the angle of the letter by turning it sideways,

391
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:04,726
it looks like the hiragana "i" or even "ri".

392
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:09,307
If this is a dying message,

393
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:14,826
Mr. Kakuzo Okudaira was killed by one of you.

394
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,626
Here in this house.

395
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,423
Stepstool.

397
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,832
Officer Takagi, may I use you as a stepstool?

398
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,020
-Yeah, sure. -Me too, then.

399
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,980
-Oh, same here! -Too heavy...
