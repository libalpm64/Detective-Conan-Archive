1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,470
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,070
With soccer and everyone's beliefs,

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,270
the case is solved!

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,270
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,810
We, the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,610
went to the soccer game with Dr. Agasa,

10
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,310
for the first time after a long interval.

11
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,910
The team we cheered for, The Tokyo Spirits,

12
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,410
beat the Noir Tokyo

13
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,310
and won the title of Tokyo Derby!

14
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,810
The train back home was full of supporters of both teams.

15
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,510
After the passengers got off the train,

16
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,710
a fatally stabbed body was found left on the floor.

17
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,210
Hey, station manager!

18
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,110
Don't start this train!

19
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,310
Someone's been stabbed!

20
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,210
What?

21
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,910
Please immediately call the personnel at all the wickets

22
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,610
and tell them to check all the tickets

23
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,510
belonging to Tokyo Spirits and Noir Tokyo supporters.

24
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,210
Look only for those who bought a ticket before 5 pm

25
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,710
and keep them here!

26
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,110
But... Why?

27
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,510
Never mind, just do it now.

28
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,110
If you don't hurry, the killer will get away!

29
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,410
The victim killed was a fanatic supporter of Noir Tokyo

30
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,810
who was proud of being a Hooligan

31
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,210
and often made news

32
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,910
by committing violent crimes one after the other

33
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,910
named Mr. Kadotake Akano.

34
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,110
The three suspects held by the police were

35
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,810
Ms. Hasue Kira,

36
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,510
Mr. Mitsuaki Funado,

37
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,610
And Mr. Etsutoshi Oba.

38
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,410
There are three suspects...

39
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,210
The only thing that was proven,

40
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,810
was that those three were on the crowded train.

41
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,410
But...

42
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,010
I cannot conclude anything from only that fact.

43
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,110
There must be something more.

44
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,510
Something else.

45
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,610
Another clue to solve the case.

46
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,610
"Hooligan in a Labyrinth (Part 2)"

47
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,710
But...

48
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,510
why is that guy...

49
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,710
What?

50
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,210
Hey, where's Haibara?

51
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,810
Oh, she said she was going to the bathroom.

52
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,710
But, how's the game going?

53
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,010
You've been listening to the radio, haven't you?

54
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,210
About that...

55
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,610
I seem to have lost my radio in the crowd

56
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,610
when we got off the train.

57
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,610
I couldn't find it either on the train or on the platform.

58
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,010
Boy, you're hopeless.

59
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,510
I think someone must have picked it up.

60
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,610
Well, the match is now first half of overtime period,

61
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,810
still with the score at 0-0.

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,210
Ramus made a splendid front pass!

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,610
Higo got the pass!

64
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,910
The defense can't catch up with him!

65
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,710
Now, this is a crucial situation!

66
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,810
Higo goes unchallenged straight to the goal!

67
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,710
Now, right in front of the goal!

68
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,910
Higo shoots for goal!

69
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,610
The ball hit the goal post

70
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,710
Have the heavens also forsaken Higo?

71
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,210
What massive booing!

72
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,610
Mr. Higo kind of resembles you.

73
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,910
Doesn't he?

74
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,010
Noir means black in French.

75
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,210
A betrayer, leaving the black...

76
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,510
What are you saying?

77
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,210
But listen, Haibara.

78
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,610
Just like you,

79
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,810
Mr. Higo also had a reason to leave the team.

80
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,210
Mr. Higo has an older half brother.

81
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,410
His name is Rikuo Endo,

82
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,710
who was a substitute defender

83
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,910
for the major league Noir Tokyo, until last year.

84
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,410
Of course, this fact is little known to the general public

85
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,110
because their family names are different

86
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,110
and they have kept it secret.

87
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,110
I heard about it two years ago,

88
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,610
when I was in the third grade of the junior high,

89
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,010
Mr. Higo and Mr. Endo, who just got into Noir Tokyo,

90
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,410
came to watch my game.

91
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,010
This is what Mr. Higo said back then.

92
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,410
"Won't you join Noir Tokyo

93
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,010
and reach for the top with us?"

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,510
But this year, Noir Tokyo suddenly notified Mr. Endo

95
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,610
that he was disqualified from playing.

96
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,310
Which means the reason they recruit Mr. Endo

97
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,810
was to get Mr. Higo.

98
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,310
Mr. Higo who took note of this,

99
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,310
moved on to Big Osaka

100
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,710
who hired Mr. Endo as a trainer.

101
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,210
Both of them are dreaming to be in the J1 League.

102
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,110
Higo got tripped!

103
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,910
The player will probably get a yellow card!

104
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,410
But, no card.

105
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,610
Despite their team forward striker getting a foul,

106
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,210
listen to the roaring cheers of the Big Osaka supporters.

107
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,010
That guy has the whole world against him.

108
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,810
Is there no pitch in Japan where he can play?

109
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,810
Wait a second.

110
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,210
I think Today's Tokyo Derby was...

111
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,910
"Tokyo Spirits vs Noir Tokyo" -It's just as I thought.

112
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,410
The murderer is that guy who was lying.

113
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,910
And...

114
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,110
if my deduction is correct,

115
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,810
I think the evidence is still on that guy's body.

116
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,260
Inspector Megure!

117
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,160
The train where the murder occurred

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,360
has been moved to the depot!

119
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,560
And we're almost done checking the areas of the platform

120
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,260
around the doors of that train car.

121
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,960
So, we did everything we had to do at this station.

122
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
All that's left to do is

123
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,460
to take you three suspects to the police station

124
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,060
and get the details from each of you.

125
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,560
"Hasue Kira (24)" -Wait!

126
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,060
Are you asking us to come to the police station voluntarily?

127
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,260
"Mitsuaki Funato (33)" -Give me a break!

128
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,360
I've got to hurry back to work. Gosh.

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,960
"Etsutoshi Oda (29) -Can we talk to you another day?

130
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,960
No, you can't!

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,260
What?

132
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,760
If we wait that long,

133
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,360
the critical evidence will disappear.

134
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,860
Or is there some special reason

135
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,160
why do you want to get away from the crime scene as soon as possible?

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,060
Hey, Shinichi!

137
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,960
What's with you, old man?

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,360
You're talking just like a detective.

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You've figured out who the murder is?

140
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,660
About that...

141
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,060
Of course!

142
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,860
I got it the moment I heard the stories of these three people.

143
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,560
The murderer is a "fake" supporter who is telling a lie.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Telling a lie?

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,860
A fake supporter?

146
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,360
Oh, I got it! You're talking about him, right?

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,460
What?

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,060
I remember you said that

149
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,260
you missed seeing the two wings' make a goal.

150
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,660
Yeah, so what?

151
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Naoki who made goal, and Hide who assisted him,

152
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,660
are the two top forwards who move freely around the field.

153
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,360
They aren't wings who just move along the sidelines, are they?

154
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,960
Is this true?

155
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,460
Yes.

156
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,460
And wing formation is so out-dated now

157
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,860
that it is hardly used in soccer games played today.

158
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,460
Rather, the truth is, I just became a soccer fan,

159
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,360
so, I thought Hide and Naoki were cool wings

160
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,160
because it sounded good.

161
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,460
How dare you make such a remark!

162
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,260
You're the murderer, aren't you?

163
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,760
What... What are you talking about?

164
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,460
I just made an incorrect remark!

165
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,060
Exactly!

166
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,460
The term "wing" that he used is a mistake

167
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,860
but not a lie.

168
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,560
So then who...

169
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,060
I'm talking about the one who hasn't even seen the game

170
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
but is pretending to have seen it

171
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,260
by making such comments about the game.

172
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,460
Well, it's no wonder since today was the match

173
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,960
between the two teams from Tokyo competing

174
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,160
for the long awaited Tokyo Derby.

175
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,660
The stadium was filled to capacity with supporters!

176
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,360
If the criminal had been watching the game together

177
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,460
with the victim, Mr. Akano from the bleachers,

178
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,860
he could lose sight of Mr. Akano in the crowd after the game.

179
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,260
Then where was the murderer waiting for him?

180
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,760
Most likely in the restroom of the stadium.

181
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,960
The guy was probably listening to the game on the radio.

182
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,160
Then the guy rushed to the exit and waited for Mr. Akano there.

183
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,060
But who is it?

184
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,560
The murderer who is lying to us.

185
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,760
Okay, then, let me ask you three once again

186
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,560
to see if you were really watching the game.

187
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,360
I was watching the whole thing at the front row stand!

188
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,160
And I saw Naoki make a goal!

189
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,660
His shot was so fantastic that

190
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,560
I got into an argument

191
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,660
with a Spirits supporter nearby.

192
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,860
I was watching the game, too,

193
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,860
from the Noir supporters' seats behind the goal.

194
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,860
Hide came dodging defenders and closing in on goal,

195
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,760
passing the ball to Naoki in front of the goal.

196
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,360
I... I was watching it from the Spirits seats

197
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,960
behind the opposite goal.

198
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
But I got a phone call from the office,

199
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,060
so I didn't get to see him make a goal.

200
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,460
But you knew Naoki and Hide made a goal?

201
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,160
Of course I do!

202
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Since after they made goal, the supporters around me

203
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,960
were raving how fantastic Hide and Naoki were.

204
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
If you think I'm lying,

205
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,460
just look at my ticket stub, here!

206
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,260
I have one too!

207
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,660
Same here!

208
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Look!

209
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,460
So...

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,660
they say...

211
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,060
Well I know that for all of you who haven't been watching the game,

212
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,360
my explanation would be difficult to understand.

213
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,760
So, let me ask these kids who were actually watching the game.

214
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,260
Tell me where our seats were.

215
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Our seats were in the front row!

216
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,360
Since we were sitting in the seats right next to the field,

217
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,160
we could see Hide overtaking four Noir players very well!

218
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,360
But I didn't see that woman who said she was in the front row!

219
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,660
Isn't that just because my seat was some distance away from yours?

220
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,060
Come on! Give me a break!

221
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,160
Is that why you think I'm lying, huh?

222
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,660
No, not really...

223
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,960
Okay, then from which side to which side did Hide cross the field,

224
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,160
when overtaking the four players?

225
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,260
From right to left!

226
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,160
So that means that the Noir goal was on the left side

227
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,860
from your point of view, right?

228
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,960
Yeah, so what?

229
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,660
I couldn't remember until I saw my ticket either,

230
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,260
but today's Tokyo Derby was hosted by the Tokyo Spirits, right?

231
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,360
What?

232
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Yes.

233
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Normally in the Japan Major League games,

234
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
the home team seats are located behind the goal

235
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,060
on the left from the front stand

236
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,860
and the opposing team seats are located behind the goal to the right.

237
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,660
So, today, the Tokyo Spirits seats ought to have been on the left side.

238
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,660
And the Noir Tokyo seats should have been on the right!

239
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,760
You see where I'm headed now, don't you?

240
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
The strange contradiction

241
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,360
that the culprit who is lying does not yet realize.

242
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,370
Strange contradiction?

243
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,870
Would you elaborate a bit more on it?

244
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,970
All right.

245
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,170
Like I said, when viewed from the front seats,

246
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,470
the Tokyo Spirit seats were on the left side

247
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,270
and the Noir Tokyo seats on the right side.

248
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,270
Hide dribbled from right to left.

249
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,670
Then after receiving the ball from Hide,

250
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,570
Naoki shot the ball to the goal to the left.

251
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,770
Just in front of the Spirits supporters' seats.

252
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,570
Which means that there is no way

253
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,670
you could say that you saw Hide dodging the defenders,

254
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,070
coming towards the goal

255
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,970
if you, Mr. Oba, had actually watched the game

256
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,270
from the Noir supporters side!

257
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,870
Listening to the live coverage on the radio,

258
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,070
you came up with your own interpretation of the

259
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,670
the announcer's statement, "Hide is closing in."

260
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,370
It's... It's just a play on words!

261
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,670
Just like him, I made a mistake, I didn't lie!

262
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,570
What I meant to say was Hide was going towards the goal

263
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,570
but I just said it wrong because I was so nervous.

264
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,670
Then check the seat on the ticket!

265
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,570
You'll see that I was in the Noir supporter seats!

266
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,270
No, you were not there.

267
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,270
Or rather, you couldn't have been there

268
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,770
if you were wearing what you are wearing now.

269
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,270
What?

270
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,070
Hey, you! This is...

271
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,570
the uniform of Higo who betrayed Noir Tokyo!

272
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,070
If you went to the Noir seats with this uniform on,

273
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,070
you'd get beaten up!

274
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,370
But Dr. Agasa,

275
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,070
it's all circumstantial evidence.

276
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,970
You need physical evidence.

277
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,570
The evidence should still be left on his arm.

278
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,370
You mean the traces of the wristwatch on his right arm?

279
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,170
But this proves only that he had his arms crossed in the crowded train.

280
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,770
It's on his opposite arm!

281
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,070
The opposite arm?

282
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,270
Just think about it!

283
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,870
If you were trying to get the knife

284
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,570
out of your bag in a crowded train,

285
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,170
it would be conspicuous and suspicious, right?

286
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,270
That's why he had his arms crossed and held the knife

287
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,570
making sure no one else saw the knife,

288
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,870
but at the same time had it ready to get out any time.

289
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,370
Of course, he was wearing a glove and holding the knife.

290
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,870
Yeah... If my deduction is correct,

291
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,970
it should still be somewhere on his upper arm

292
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,770
opposite from his dominant hand.

293
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,570
The traces of the rare scabbard design of the knife he was holding

294
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,070
under his arm very clearly!

295
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,570
Exactly!

296
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,770
So, you're the one who killed him, after all?

297
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,470
I studied soccer,

298
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,370
passed myself off as a supporter,

299
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,270
and I tried to make the plan work for my younger brother.

300
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,370
But who would have thought that

301
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,570
he was the one to blow it up.

302
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,270
Your younger brother?

303
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,770
My twin brother...

304
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,770
Who was killed by that Akano a year ago.

305
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,670
Killed?

306
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,870
On that day a year ago,

307
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,370
my brother came back home from the Noir Tokyo game

308
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,870
with scars all over him.

309
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,770
He told me that he had fallen from the stairs of the stadium.

310
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,070
But, that night,

311
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,770
my brother suddenly collapsed clutching his head in his hands

312
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,070
and lost consciousness.

313
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,570
He died three days later.

314
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,470
The death was caused by a brain hemorrhage due to a fractured skull.

315
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,370
I visited Akano's website, "Tokyo Hooligan",

316
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,770
that my brother often accessed

317
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,570
and read Akano's web journal of the day.

318
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,270
It said: "Today after the game,

319
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,970
I kicked some jerks who criticized my site,

320
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,070
down the stairs of the stadium.

321
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,170
That's what was written.

322
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,870
But, how could you be sure it was your younger brother?

323
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,470
I know,

324
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,270
because when I tried to meet Akano to ascertain what really happened

325
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,570
When he looked at my face,

326
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,470
that guy sniggered saying,

327
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,570
"Oh, you're still alive?"

328
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,970
That's why I avenged my kid brother's death

329
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,370
while wearing his memento.

330
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,070
So then that uniform is...

331
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,470
Yes. My younger brother used to wear this to Noir's game.

332
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,170
Higo's uniform.

333
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,270
It never occurred to me that

334
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,470
I would get caught because of this uniform.

335
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,370
Maybe this uniform

336
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,170
was a kind of warning from my younger brother

337
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,470
in the world beyond.

338
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,670
What?

339
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,070
Because...

340
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,870
if some Noir Tokyo supporter noticed this uniform

341
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,070
and warned me...

342
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,770
They could have calmed my feeling of murderous anger

343
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,470
and help me snap out of it, saying,

344
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,770
"Just what do you think you're doing?"

345
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,770
By the way, isn't Haibara taking too long?

346
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,170
Oh, yeah.

347
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,170
What? Isn't Haibara back yet?

348
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,470
No, she's not.

349
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,470
Look! There she is!

350
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,070
Over there on the platform!

351
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,370
Oh, you're right.

352
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,770
Hey, what's she doing all the way over there?

353
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,170
The train to Beika leaves from this track.

354
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,670
Don't tell me she's...

355
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,570
Because there is really no room for a traitor.

356
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,470
He can forget everything

357
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,070
and flee to a place far away

358
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,270
from all the booing.

359
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,470
No way!

360
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,470
Haibara!

361
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,070
Haibara!

362
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,070
Haibara!

363
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,670
Haibara!

364
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,870
Darn it!

365
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,070
What are you shouting about?

366
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,170
Did you think I ran away?

367
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,270
Oh, no, I...

368
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,470
Here it is, young lady!

369
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,570
Don't drop it again, okay?

370
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,070
Thank you.

371
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,270
A radio?

372
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,970
I was just looking for the radio Tsuburaya dropped.

373
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,470
When I asked a station officer,

374
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,370
he told me that a sanitary worker could have picked it up.

375
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,320
Oh, really.

376
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,120
You told me, didn't you?

377
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,470
To not to run away.

378
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,270
You told me not to run away from my destiny.

379
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,370
You're gonna protect me, right?

380
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,570
Oh, yeah.

381
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,770
Well, of course,

382
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,070
I'm not a weak little girl

383
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,570
that needs to be protected all the time,

384
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,770
like you think I am, though.

385
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,170
Oh, Haibara.

386
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,070
I forgot to tell you, Mr. Higo did it.

387
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,270
He made the winning goal.

388
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,070
The whole stadium suddenly started to cheer for him.

389
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,970
I knew it from the start

390
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,970
that the booing was a kinda pep talk to him

391
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,670
who hadn't played up to his potential.

392
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,770
So, what? Why are you telling me that?

393
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,570
How stupid!

394
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,870
Don't class me with soccer freaks like you.

395
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:54,070
Higo...

396
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,370
Talk about a hard head...

397
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,940
Next Conan Hint:

398
