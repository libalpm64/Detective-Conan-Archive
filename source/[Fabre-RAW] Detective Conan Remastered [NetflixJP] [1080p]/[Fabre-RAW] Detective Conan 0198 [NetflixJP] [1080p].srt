1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,540
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,240
Tonight, we solve the case involving the super car.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,040
No one's ever seen anything like it before.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,590
We have come to the Izu Highlands after winning first prize

9
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,590
in the neighborhood association's drawing

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,890
which was a one night's stay in a hotel here.

11
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,590
The owner of the hotel turns out to be a real car buff

12
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,490
and a historic car show is opening at the hotel the following day.

13
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,390
The guests that show up though, all have had their valuable cars

14
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,190
taken away by the owner through deceitful methods.

15
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,490
That night, the owner of the hotel goes for a late night drive

16
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,790
and the next morning,

17
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,890
he is found dead in the driver's seat of his car!

18
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,490
"The Super Car's Trap (Part 2)"

19
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,090
What do you think, doctor?

20
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,390
The cause of death is probably

21
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,890
carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the exhaust fumes.

22
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,890
And I see no other external injuries.

23
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,090
The estimated time of death is between 9.00 am and 10.00 am.

24
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,490
That's right, he was still alive

25
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,890
when I called him on his cellular a little past 9.00 am.

26
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,490
You talked to him?

27
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,490
How did he sound?

28
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,690
He sounded like he was in pain and he said

29
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,490
"Where am I?" and "It's pitch dark",

30
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,390
gibberish like that.

31
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,590
I guess the carbon monoxide was making him delirious.

32
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,790
That means he must've died right after you called.

33
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,590
Excuse me, Detective Yokomizo,

34
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,390
doesn't that mean Mr. Teraizumi was here way before 9.00 am?

35
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,390
Of course, you nincompoop!

36
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,990
By the way, Mr. Mouri.

37
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,190
About the window on the driver's side,

38
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,790
why do you think it's slightly open?

39
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,890
Survival instinct!

40
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,390
The exhaust fumes were suffocating him

41
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,790
and he must've opened it in desperation.

42
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,390
But why did he die then?

43
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,190
Because by the time he got the window open,

44
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,290
it was too late.

45
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,190
What is this?

46
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,390
It breaks off straight across.

47
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,690
Hey, you there.

48
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,490
You shouldn't be wandering around here!

49
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,190
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,390
I was just wondering what this black stain was.

51
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,890
That's coal tar, it's made when fuel is imperfectly combusted.

52
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,990
It dripped out of the muffler.

53
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,590
It happens a lot in these old cars.

54
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,490
Gee, but it looks so shiny and new.

55
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,190
Yeah, it's been polished so good,

56
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,090
there's hardly any fingerprints on it.

57
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,490
What is it? Is something wrong?

58
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,490
It seems this car's been in an accident lately.

59
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,890
There's a crack in the left head lamp

60
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,990
and we found some fibers in it.

61
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,890
A crack and fibers...

62
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,290
Well, here we are.

63
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,590
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

64
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,790
Let's start right away,

65
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,290
which of you is Mr. Sagara, the one who first discovered the body.

66
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,990
That's me.

67
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,790
Will you give us the details of how you found the body?

68
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,090
"Shinsuke Sagara (37)" -I got back from my morning drive

69
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,290
"Car Repair Factory Manager" -a little past 10.00 am

70
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,190
and I was just about to park my car in the parking lot

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,590
when I nearly crashed into the Dino.

72
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,990
You see, the fog hadn't lifted yet.

73
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,290
And when look in the car,

74
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,690
I saw Mr. Teraizumi slumped in the driver's seat.

75
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,190
Is there anything else you noticed?

76
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,490
Now that you mention it,

77
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,790
I saw all these other people all gathered near the parking lot.

78
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,990
That was my fault.

79
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,090
What do you mean, Ran?

80
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,090
Ran let out this loud scream that scared us,

81
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,690
so we all ran out to see what was up.

82
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,990
The fog was so thick I couldn't see

83
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,490
and when the security guard called out to me, it scared me.

84
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,890
I see.

85
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,390
By the way, about the late Mr. Teraizumi,

86
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,290
we assume he returned from his drive

87
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,190
and sat in his car with the engine running

88
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,790
and died from carbon monoxide inhalation.

89
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,690
Does anyone know why he would sit in his car

90
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,790
with the engine running?

91
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,190
"Zenkichi Kuroiwa (45)" -The truth is, Mr. Teraizumi loved that car

92
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,790
"Hotel Manager" -more than anything, why just yesterday...

93
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,990
Sir, the other cars are already in their places.

94
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,990
Why don't you take yours there now?

95
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,890
Hold it, just one minute, don't rush me.

96
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,190
I want to spend tonight with "my friend"!

97
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,690
Once it's on display,

98
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,090
I won't be able to take it for a spin whenever I feel like it.

99
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,390
I guess that's why he couldn't tear himself away from his beloved car

100
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,790
after he got back from his drive.

101
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,590
I see, and then he must have fallen asleep.

102
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,590
Mr. Teraizumi was really looking forward

103
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,690
to the opening of the show room today.

104
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,990
I feel so sorry for him.

105
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,990
You can stop the charade now, Mr. Kuroiwa.

106
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,490
Tell us the truth, you're relieved he's dead, aren't you?

107
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,690
What are you talking about?

108
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,290
I know all about it,

109
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,990
Mr. Teraizumi was just about to lay you off.

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,990
You were being laid off? Is that true?

111
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,190
Yes, it is true.

112
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,890
But I didn't hate him!

113
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,090
Not like these men here!

114
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,690
What do you mean by that?

115
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,990
They all hated him!

116
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,390
They had their precious cars taken away by Mr. Teraizumi

117
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,390
when they couldn't repay their debts.

118
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,190
And don't forget the threatening letter!

119
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,890
A threatening letter?

120
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,690
Oh, that was nothing but a prank.

121
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,090
"Don't open the show room or you'll be sorry."

122
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,990
But this could mean his death was a murder.

123
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,890
A murder?

124
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,890
How can kill you someone by carbon monoxide poisoning?

125
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,490
But you see, Mr. Mouri...

126
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,690
Detective Yokomizo?

127
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,590
Mr. Kogoro always says that

128
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,590
the most important thing is everyone's alibi, isn't that right?

129
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,890
Yes, you're right, Conan.

130
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,890
Well, does anyone have anything to say?

131
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,390
"Ichirou Ootake (55)" -When that private detective over there

132
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,690
Jouji Kameoka (40) -called Mr. Teraizumi,

133
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,790
he was still alive, wasn't he?

134
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,390
We were all with that detective after that.

135
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,090
That's right, the only ones missing

136
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,490
were Mr. Sagara and Suguro over there.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,490
Eh? Are you talking about me?

138
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,190
"Hisashi Suguro(28)" -Oh come on, the only time I left everyone

139
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,790
is to prepare for the opening ceremony

140
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,590
and that was for only five minutes, from 10.00 am to 10.05 am.

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,190
That's when we heard Ran scream

142
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,390
and we all ran out into the parking lot.

143
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,890
I couldn't have killed him in just five minutes!

144
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,690
You're right about that.

145
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,690
Mr. Sagara, you stated that you were out for a drive.

146
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,090
That's right and it was Mr. Sagara who found Mr. Teraizumi dead!

147
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,090
Mr. Sagara! Don't tell me it was you.

148
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,790
No, you're wrong! It wasn't me!

149
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,890
I was on the veranda yesterday

150
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,190
and I heard Mr. Sagara talking on the telephone.

151
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,090
Don't worry about it! I'll take care of it!

152
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,890
The opening ceremonies at 3.00 pm tomorrow afternoon.

153
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,590
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

154
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,390
That's right, don't worry.

155
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,490
We're going ahead as scheduled, understand?

156
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,490
Do you want to explain, Mr. Sagara?

157
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,290
The truth is, I borrowed some money from a friend.

158
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,290
You borrowed money?

159
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,990
Yes. I was going to repay Teraizumi and get my car back

160
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,190
but I figured paying him back wasn't good enough,

161
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,790
I was going to throw the money on his face at the opening ceremony

162
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,990
and put his nose out of joint.

163
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,190
That's why I rushed to Tokyo last night to get the money.

164
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,890
If you call my friend, he'll confirm my story.

165
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,090
It seems everyone has an alibi.

166
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,290
It must have been an accident after all.

167
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,190
Excuse me, detective.

168
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,990
I'd like to put the Dino on display, in memory of Mr. Teraizumi.

169
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,490
Yes, you're right.

170
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,990
We're done inspecting the crime scene,

171
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,090
I guess it'll be all right.

172
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,190
Thank you very much!

173
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,190
If it wasn't Mr. Sagara, I wonder...

174
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,390
Last night, he...

175
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,690
Mr. Kuroiwa, excuse me.

176
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,590
Huh? What is it?

177
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,590
That guy from the crime lab just told me that

178
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,390
the Dino's headlight cover was cracked.

179
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,990
Eh? Is that true? It wasn't there yesterday,

180
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,990
and if Mr. Teraizumi hit something,

181
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,690
he'd have made a big fuss and have it get it fixed right away.

182
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,590
I knew it.

183
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,290
Mr. Teraizumi hit something when he got back from his drive.

184
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,790
But how did the killer commit the murder?

185
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,190
What was that? Are you sure about that?

186
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,690
Yes, I checked the parking lot a little before 10.00 am

187
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,390
but Mr. Teraizumi's car wasn't there.

188
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,590
But the fog was very thick, maybe you overlooked it.

189
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,990
No, I'd never make that mistake.

190
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,590
There was another car parked in his space.

191
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,490
Another car?

192
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,690
Yes. I didn't get a good look because of the fog,

193
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,890
but I think it was gray.

194
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,790
And I'd never heard that engine before

195
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,490
so I know it wasn't one of our regular guest.

196
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,190
Then the car's engine was running.

197
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,290
Yes, and I'd recognize Mr. Teraizumi's car engine any day.

198
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,490
What does all that mean?

199
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,290
Detective Yokomizo.

200
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,490
Please come with me.

201
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,090
What's up?

202
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,390
That's it!

203
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,490
Excuse me, Mr. Noda, at that time, just by chance...

204
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,490
What? Mr. Sagara did what?

205
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,690
Yes, he said he'd repaid the money he owed

206
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,390
so he was taking his car back right now.

207
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,690
Darn, we've already got our hands full!

208
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,190
-Let's go! -Yes, sir!

209
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,490
How'd you know that, kid?

210
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,290
So I'm right!

211
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,390
Yes, you sure are, kid!

212
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,090
Now I know everything!

213
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,890
I know why the tar was broken off straight across

214
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,590
and why that gray car was in the parking lot!

215
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,490
And I've solved the mystery of the cracked headlight and the fiber!

216
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,190
I have all the answers now.

217
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,290
He's the killer!

218
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Stop it, Mr. Sagara!

219
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,980
You can't do this!

220
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,680
What do you mean?

221
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,980
I just paid the money back, didn't I?

222
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,180
I'm taking my car back no matter what you say!

223
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,080
Wait a minute, Mr. Sagara!

224
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,980
What's going on here?

225
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm glad you're here.

226
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Mr. Sagara insists on leaving with his car.

227
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,280
We can't allow that.

228
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,980
You have to stay here until we've cleared everyone.

229
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,080
What do you mean, wasn't it an accident?

230
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,380
Well, it appears it may not have been.

231
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,280
Did you find something?

232
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,180
When the security guard Mr. Noda

233
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,380
checked the parking lot a little before 10.00 am,

234
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,080
instead of Mr. Teraizumi's car,

235
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,380
he claims that he saw a gray car parked in his spot.

236
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,280
What? That means...

237
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,080
Oh boy. Here we go again...

238
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,780
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

239
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,480
Mr. Mouri...

240
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,680
I've finally figured everything out, Detective Yokomizo.

241
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,580
What you just said confirmed it all.

242
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,180
What do you mean?

243
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,580
Mr. Teraizumi's death was not an accident.

244
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,880
It was pre-meditated murder!

245
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,980
Detective Yokomizo,

246
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,680
before I start explaining how the crime was committed,

247
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,980
I'd like you to prepare something.

248
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,480
I understand. What do you need?

249
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,280
First, could you call Mr. Noda, the security guard here?

250
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
-Go on. -Yes, sir!

251
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,780
And another thing,

252
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,180
I need a large vinyl sheet if possible.

253
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,280
One like the kind they use to cover cars.

254
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,680
A car cover.

255
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,480
If it's one of those, Suguro,

256
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,180
your car in the parking lot is always covered, isn't it?

257
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,980
Yes.

258
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,280
You have one? Do you mind lending it to us?

259
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,980
Sure, no problem.

260
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Now that everything is ready, let us begin.

261
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,180
When Mr. Teraizumi got back from his drive,

262
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,080
the killer used a sleeping drug to put him to sleep,

263
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,680
then put him behind the wheel of the Dino

264
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,080
and left him there with the engine running.

265
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,680
That leaves me out.

266
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,680
When I left for Tokyo,

267
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,380
Mr. Teraizumi wasn't back yet!

268
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,280
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

269
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,880
What?

270
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,780
No one saw Mr. Teraizumi return.

271
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,480
So can you prove he didn't get back before you left?

272
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,780
How dare you?

273
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,480
Just calm down.

274
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,580
Let me remind you, Mr. Mouri,

275
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,280
when Mr. Noda, the security guard

276
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,280
made his rounds shortly before the body was found,

277
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,980
he claims Mr. Teraizumi's car was not in the parking lot.

278
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,780
But in truth, it was already there

279
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,780
when Mr. Noda checked the parking lot.

280
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,280
He's already stated there was a gray car in that space.

281
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,880
And that car was Mr. Teraizumi's!

282
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,780
What was that?

283
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,480
But still... Mr. Noda said the engine wasn't Mr. Teraizumi's.

284
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,980
Yes.

285
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,480
That engine wasn't Mr. Teraizumi's Dino.

286
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,780
It was another car!

287
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,680
All right, Detective Yokomizo,

288
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,180
turn the ignition on.

289
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,980
All right.

290
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,080
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,780
Mr. Mouri, the engine's running.

292
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Okay, how about it, Mr. Noda?

293
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,880
It's not the same,

294
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,280
that's not the car I heard in the parking lot.

295
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,580
Now, Detective Yokomizo,

296
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,580
could you cover the Dino with that cover?

297
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
This cover?

298
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,680
Yes.

299
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,080
All right. Mr. Noda,

300
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,280
listen very carefully.

301
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,380
All right.

302
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,680
This is it! This is the engine I heard!

303
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
Are you sure?

304
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,080
But why cover the car?

305
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,880
I've got it! That's why the window...

306
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,780
That's right! That's why the window was down

307
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,280
so that the exhaust fumes would enter the car!

308
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,580
After the killer put Mr. Teraizumi to sleep,

309
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,680
he lowered the window

310
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,780
then covered the car

311
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,280
and anchored it down securely

312
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,080
so that the fumes wouldn't escape.

313
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,180
Does everyone remember

314
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,580
Mr. Teraizumi's last words over the telephone?

315
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,480
Hello, Mr. Teraizumi?

316
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,080
It's me, Mouri. Where are you?

317
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,180
Where am I?

318
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,580
It's... it's pitch black.

319
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,680
Pitch black?

320
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,780
I've got it!

321
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,880
Mr. Teraizumi said it was dark because the car was covered!

322
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,080
That's right.

323
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,680
And the exhaust fumes trapped under the cover

324
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,480
entered the car through the open window

325
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,380
causing him to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.

326
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Then the killer waited until the right moment,

327
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,780
returned to the car and took the cover off

328
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,680
leaving us with what he thought to be the perfect crime.

329
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,780
But then something the killer didn't anticipate occurred!

330
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,480
And what was that?

331
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,280
One, Mr. Noda saw the car with the cover on!

332
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,680
It was coincidence

333
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,580
that you went to the parking lot at that time, wasn't it?

334
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,980
Yes, Mr. Kuroiwa had asked me to look for Mr. Teraizumi,

335
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,380
that's why I went there.

336
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,480
The second thing was Ran's scream.

337
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Huh, my scream?

338
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,580
Yes, I'm sure the killer had gone to take the cover off,

339
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,280
but when Ran screamed, he got scared

340
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,580
and forgot to close the window!

341
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,180
Which means, that the killer

342
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,880
is the person who arrived last to where Ran was.

343
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,480
Suguro, it was you!

344
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,680
Suguro...

345
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
You can't be serious.

346
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,980
Just because I arrived late when your daughter screamed,

347
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,580
don't make me out to be the killer.

348
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,880
Suguro, explain the stain on your trousers.

349
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,280
The stain is from the wine you spilled on them last night.

350
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,380
That's right,

351
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,380
but when you brought the room service order to our room...

352
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm very sorry about ruining your pants earlier.

353
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,780
No problem, it was nothing. I changed right away.

354
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,780
So why did you change back into a pair of stained trousers?

355
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,880
That's none of your business.

356
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,080
The head lamp on Mr. Teraizumi's car

357
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,280
was cracked and some fiber was stuck to it!

358
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,280
When Mr. Teraizumi returned,

359
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,980
you stopped his car and it accidentally hit your knee

360
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,780
and it tore your trousers, didn't it?

361
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,380
You're just making everything up.

362
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Mr. Noda, when you saw the strange car in the parking lot,

363
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,280
why didn't you check it out?

364
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,480
Well, Suguro told me to check the front entrance.

365
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,780
He's lying!

366
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,880
Please check under Suguro's car cover,

367
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,780
look at the part that goes over the muffler,

368
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,980
you should find some black liquid on it!

369
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,380
Some time has past, hasn't it?

370
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,980
I found it! A black stain just like you said, Mr. Mouri!

371
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
At the scene of the crime,

372
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,180
we found stains from the tar that flowed out of the Dino's muffler.

373
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,780
It looked like it was cut off straight across,

374
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,180
as if it had been blocked off!

375
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,080
I'm sure when we have it analyzed,

376
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,680
we'll find the composition of the stains are identical.

377
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,180
What have you got to say, Katssuro?

378
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,780
Are you going to insist you're innocent?

379
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,480
Okay, you got me! I killed Teraizumi!

380
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,380
That Dino was once my car.

381
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,980
But he cheated me out of it!

382
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,080
You killed him over something like that.

383
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,980
Something like that?

384
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,080
Don't put me in the same boat as those rich good for nothings!

385
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,780
That car was about to be scrapped when I got it,

386
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,580
I sacrificed my food money and worked hard on it

387
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,480
to get it looking like it does now.

388
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
And then Teraizumi comes along and...

389
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,580
Getting there was so much fun

390
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,680
but when it comes time to leave, all the fight's gone.

391
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,480
Like they say, getting there is half the fun but leaving is horrible.

392
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
I guess we should have take

393
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,580
the "eat all you can Shabu shabu" dinner after all.

394
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,080
Hey dad, maybe we should have asked Detective Yokomizo to drive us.

395
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,180
That rat! He didn't even offer!

396
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,280
Are you coming down with a cold, sir?

397
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,080
I don't know, I suddenly felt a chill.

398
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Take care of yourself.

399
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,480
I've never caught a cold

400
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,680
Really?

401
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,680
I'm never going to help you again!

402
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,120
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,180
"Chain lock"

404
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,580
No one wants to get involved in the fracas of the next episode.

405
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,640
Dad, I don't believe, I just can't...
