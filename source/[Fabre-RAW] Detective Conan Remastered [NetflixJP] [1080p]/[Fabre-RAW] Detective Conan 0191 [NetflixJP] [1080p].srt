1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,940
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,840
It's what you've all been waiting for,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
he makes his appearance after a long absence!

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,290
While exploring a limestone cave,

9
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,590
I was shot by a gang of bank robbers.

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,390
Ran's blood is used for my transfusion and it saved my life.

11
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,290
This makes me decide to tell Ran about everything.

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,790
But then Haibara points a gun at me.

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,390
I came here to make things clear to you.

14
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,090
I want you to know that

15
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,190
she'll certainly be one of those the organization gets rid of.

16
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,590
You have three choices.

17
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,890
The first is,

18
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,090
leave things as it is,

19
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,490
don't tell her anything and keep your distance.

20
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,590
Second,

21
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,690
you cast your fates to the wind

22
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,990
and tell her everything.

23
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,390
Or your third choice which is...

24
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,390
Later at Teitan High School on the day of their school festival,

25
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,290
during the play in the gymnasium,

26
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,290
a murder is committed right among the audience.

27
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,790
"Perilous Return: The Black Knight"

28
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,090
It's still not clear what trick the killer used

29
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,590
to poison Mr. Kamata's drink,

30
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,990
nonetheless,

31
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,990
it's clear one of you is the killer.

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,190
Isn't that right, Inspector?

33
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,690
-Well... -Inspector!

34
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,490
We found unopened tubs of milk and gum syrup

35
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,590
in Mr. Kamata's pocket.

36
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,290
Unopened?

37
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,790
Which could only mean...

38
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,790
Hey, did Mr. Kamata usually drink his iced coffee black?

39
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,790
No, I'm pretty sure he always used the milk and gum syrup.

40
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,390
-Right? -Yes, I'm sure he did too.

41
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,790
Then, why were both of it were unopened?

42
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,690
His drink...

43
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,490
There was cola in his cup, not iced coffee.

44
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,990
What?

45
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,790
I thought that he'd come to the concession to change it

46
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,790
if I did that.

47
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,990
I thought he might come to ask me

48
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,190
why I broke off our engagement.

49
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,290
You were engaged?

50
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,690
Yes, we intended to get married after I graduated.

51
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,290
But I started to feel insecure

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,790
and I called him last week to break it off.

53
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,990
I've gone to the hospital, but he refused to see me.

54
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,890
So that's why there was cola in mine, too.

55
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:33,190
I almost put this milk and gum syrup in it, you know.

56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,990
I'm very sorry.

57
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,590
Well, let's take all their drinks and the milk and gum syrup

58
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,790
down to the lab and have it analyzed.

59
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,090
We'll continue this conversation later

60
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,290
Yes, sir!

61
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,590
Inspector.

62
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,190
From the looks of things, you can't overlook that either.

63
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,490
What do you mean?

64
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,890
Suicide!

65
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,690
He must've taken quite a shock being dumped

66
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,390
by a girl 10 years younger than him and he might've already

67
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,390
been thinking of suicide when he runs into her here.

68
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,390
So he decides to kill himself right in her presence.

69
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,190
And if things worked out right, she'd become the prime suspect.

70
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,790
I just remembered, wasn't Kamata looking around for something

71
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,490
on his car's dashboard?

72
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,590
Right, he said he was looking for his driver's license.

73
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,090
Huh? Did you remember something?

74
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,990
No, we all came here with Kamata's car,

75
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,990
and we thought he acted a little strange.

76
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,790
Like feeling around his dashboard.

77
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,690
Officer Takagi, have someone take you to his car

78
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,390
and check it out.

79
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,090
We might find something.

80
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,590
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,990
This way.

82
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,090
Hey, Kudo.

83
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,290
You probably figured it out too, right?

84
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,090
The person who poisoned the drink

85
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,390
is more than likely that person.

86
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,790
The lid was off the victim's cup the whole time,

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,890
but there was cola inside it and not iced coffee.

88
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,690
And the strange things that person said.

89
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,690
The trick has been completely blown.

90
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,590
All we need is the evidence, then our theory will be perfect.

91
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,590
Hey!

92
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,090
Hey, wait! Come back!

93
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,190
He and that kid are such good friends.

94
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,890
Right.

95
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,090
Oh, what a bummer.

96
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,090
We get caught in a weird case and the play is called off.

97
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,390
And now it's starting to rain.

98
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,890
It's put a damper on everything.

99
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,690
Isn't that right, sir?

100
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,590
There's nothing we can do,

101
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,390
not when something like this happened.

102
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,490
There will always be a next time,

103
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,490
let's just call it quits for today.

104
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,590
Is that so? Anyway, thank you for your cooperation.

105
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,490
Inspector!

106
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,690
Officer Takagi!

107
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,990
How was it?

108
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,590
We found this on the dashboard of the victim's car.

109
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,390
I'm pretty sure it's potassium cyanide.

110
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,690
Good work!

111
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,690
The forensic lab just called me

112
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,090
saying there was no trace of poison in any of the drinks.

113
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,090
Then, you mean...

114
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,090
That's right. We'll close this as a case of suicide.

115
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,990
Just a minute, Inspector!

116
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,690
This is no suicide.

117
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,590
It's a simple and straightforward...

118
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,090
murder!

119
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,490
No! Don't do it!

120
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,290
You're not supposed to be out front in the spotlight.

121
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,690
That's not allowed.

122
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,590
Don't you understand that?

123
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,790
That's right. Mr. Kamata was poisoned

124
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,390
right before this stage draped in darkness.

125
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,290
The killer knew the victim's habit

126
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,690
and used it to commit the murder.

127
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,390
And I am certain the killer still has the weapon.

128
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:16,090
Like the risk I take, the crime was also bold and brazen.

129
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,290
That is, if I am correct.

130
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,590
Who are you?

131
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,190
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure.

132
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,790
It's me, Shinichi Kudo.

133
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,090
Idiot.

134
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Shinichi?

135
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,880
I don't believe it. It can't be...

136
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,680
Because Shinichi is...

137
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,080
Shinichi is...

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,480
This guy is Kudo and so is that guy.

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
What's going on here?

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,280
He is such a man.

141
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,680
Yes! That's our hero!

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,780
It's Shinichi Kudo!

143
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,380
Show them what you can do, Kudo!

144
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:16,880
Kudo...

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
Quiet, please.

146
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,580
You can celebrate

147
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,680
after we bring the curtain down on this murder.

148
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,680
He is as dramatic as always.

149
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,580
Shinichi.

150
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,480
Are you really Shinichi?

151
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,080
What? You idiot.

152
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,980
You must still be sleepy.

153
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I have something important to tell later,

154
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,780
so don't you go running off.

155
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,680
Hattori.

156
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,980
Do you have any 10 yen coins on you?

157
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,380
Sure, I think I've got a couple.

158
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,180
But what are you going to do with them?

159
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,680
I get it now.

160
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,280
Can I borrow one for awhile?

161
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,980
Sure thing, but it'll cost you.

162
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
I will give it back to you soon.

163
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,680
Kudo.

164
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,380
You've been away a long time

165
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,680
and I appreciate you trying to help,

166
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,980
but there was no trace of poison from the victim's cup

167
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,580
nor his three friends'.

168
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,780
On top of that, the victim drank most of his drink.

169
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,080
So, no matter how you look at it...

170
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,680
Yes, at first glance, it looks like suicide

171
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,080
where Mr. Kamata took the poison himself.

172
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,480
If you use a certain something,

173
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,180
murder is also a possibility.

174
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,680
A certain something?

175
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,980
That's right and it's a very basic trick.

176
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,380
By using ice.

177
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,680
Did you say ice?

178
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,580
The poison used was potassium cyanide,

179
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,880
which doesn't dissolve easily in iced water.

180
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
A tiny hole was made in the ice

181
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,080
and the poison was poured in the center,

182
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
then a thin piece of ice was used

183
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,480
to plug the hole and refrozen.

184
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,780
The ice cube was then put into the victim's cup,

185
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,680
so by the time the ice melts and the poison seeps out,

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,380
Mr. Kamata would have finished up his drink.

187
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,780
But then there should be some trace of poison left in his cup.

188
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,380
The lid on the victim's cup. It was off, wasn't it?

189
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,180
Do you know why?

190
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,280
After he drank the poison, it probably fell off

191
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,680
when he crushed the cup because of the pain.

192
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,280
You fool, then why wasn't the cup crushed?

193
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,080
There's only one reason someone would take the lid off their cup

194
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,680
after finishing their drink.

195
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
The victim didn't drink the poison,

196
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
he ate it!

197
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,980
He ate it?

198
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,280
I get it! Inspector, you usually eat the ice in your drink, too.

199
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,880
I see.

200
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,080
Someone who knew the victim had this habit

201
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,080
could have poisoned him

202
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,280
and nothing would be left in the cup.

203
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,780
And? Who put the poisoned ice in the victim's cup?

204
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,580
Mr. Mitani who just handed him the drink

205
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,480
and Ms. Noda wouldn't have had the chance.

206
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Ms. Ninagawa who sold the drinks had the opportunity.

207
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,680
But she deliberately put cola into the iced coffee he ordered,

208
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880
so she wouldn't poison his drink

209
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,180
knowing he might return to exchange it.

210
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,180
Besides, there was another person who ordered iced coffee,

211
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,180
so she wouldn't know who would get poisoned.

212
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,580
There was only a 50 chance of success,

213
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,380
and the risks were too high.

214
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,580
So, you mean...

215
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,180
That's right.

216
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
The person who poisoned Mr. Kamata

217
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,480
is the one who bought the drinks,

218
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,680
then delivered them to everyone.

219
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Ms. Mai Kogami.

220
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,080
You're the only one who could have done it.

221
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,880
Mai...

222
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
You went to the concession to buy drinks.

223
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,580
So you had the opportunity to open the drinks

224
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,180
and drop the poisoned ice cube

225
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,480
in pretending to put milk and gum syrup in it.

226
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,080
Just a minute.

227
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,580
Mai didn't put milk or gum syrup in those drinks!

228
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,180
She's right!

229
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,680
You found the unopened tubs in Kamata's pocket, didn't you?

230
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,080
That's because when she dropped the ice in,

231
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,680
she realized it was cola.

232
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,380
If she put the milk and gum syrup in it,

233
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,380
there was the chance Mr. Kamata wouldn't drink it.

234
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,680
The reason she brought you the drinks

235
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,280
just before the play was about to begin

236
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,080
was so that he wouldn't bother to go change it.

237
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
After all, even if he realized it wasn't iced coffee,

238
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
once the room got dark, it would be a bother

239
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,280
to get up and go to the concession.

240
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,280
But how did she go around carrying the poisoned ice cube?

241
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,580
Oh, the answer to that

242
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,180
is this item that I found in the trash can outside the restroom

243
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,680
when Officer Takagi left the room.

244
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,580
It's this vinyl pouch.

245
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,280
Get that to the lab, quick!

246
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
Yes, sir!

247
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,380
If you put the poisoned ice cube in here

248
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,580
with a tiny piece of dry ice,

249
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,180
it won't melt for quite a while.

250
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,780
Ms. Kogami, after you handed the poisoned drink

251
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,280
along with the others, you went to the restroom

252
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
and flushed the dry ice down,

253
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,780
then threw the pouch in the trash can.

254
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,780
Have I made a mistake in my deduction?

255
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,780
Mai...

256
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,180
My hats off to you, Shinichi Kudo.

257
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,880
You're as good as what I heard.

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,180
But have you forgotten?

259
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,080
I also had iced coffee

260
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,180
and I handed it to Mitani along with the others.

261
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,980
I had no idea which cup he'd give Kohei,

262
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,180
so how could I poison his drink?

263
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,080
Or are you saying I took a 50/50 chance

264
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,080
that he'd get it and if that's the case, then Ayako also...

265
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,280
No, you were covered 100%.

266
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,780
That's because you put poisoned ice cubes in both cups.

267
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,580
That's ridiculous!

268
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,380
She drank all the contents of her cup.

269
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,080
That can be accomplished

270
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,280
if she gulped it all down before the ice melted.

271
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,180
But there'd still be traces of poison in her cup.

272
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,280
And if she tried to get the poisoned ice cube out,

273
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,880
the others around her would notice.

274
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,680
Like Mr. Kamata, what if she put the ice cube in her mouth

275
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
and pretend to eat it?

276
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,180
What?

277
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,580
That's right. Without anyone noticing,

278
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,480
she spit the ice out in her hand

279
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,480
and hid in a certain place.

280
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,180
And that place would be...

281
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Putting poisoned ice in your mouth is extremely dangerous,

282
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,280
but if the poison is in the very center,

283
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,180
it is possible in getting the deed done.

284
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,080
But are you sure it was in her hood?

285
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,180
It's not a lie.

286
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,580
Take a look at this!

287
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,480
All the tarnish is gone from the coin, see how shiny it is.

288
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,780
It's proof that it came in contact with potassium cyanide

289
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,080
and oxidation reduction reaction has occurred.

290
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,280
Oh, I see.

291
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,480
How did you know

292
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,280
she put the poisoned ice cube in the hood?

293
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,080
Well, that's...

294
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,480
Because of the rain.

295
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
Huh?

296
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,180
It was raining,

297
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,380
but when I went outside to show the officer to Kamata's car,

298
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,980
I didn't cover my head with the hood.

299
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,580
That's what made you suspicious, isn't that right?

300
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,880
Yes, I figured that the ice melted,

301
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,880
and you didn't want the poison all over your head.

302
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,880
So, like he said, you killed Kamata?

303
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,680
Yes, that's right.

304
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
I poisoned him.

305
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,680
He was a disgrace as a doctor!

306
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,480
What do you mean by that?

307
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm sure you all know about it.

308
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm talking about the doctrine he was going to present

309
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,580
at the next conference.

310
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,080
What?

311
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,980
But there was an unusual patient in our hospital

312
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
who would have overruled his theory.

313
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,180
Unfortunately, his condition turned for the worse and he died.

314
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,180
It's almost as if it's an exception to the theory never existed.

315
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,080
Are you saying that Kamata...

316
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,980
That's right. He gave that patient the wrong medication,

317
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
and made his symptoms worse, killing him.

318
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,780
Just to protect his meaningless research.

319
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,380
He told me himself last week

320
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,180
that Ayako broke off their engagement and he was upset.

321
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,680
So, I went drinking with him and he got very drunk.

322
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,180
He didn't even regret what he did,

323
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,180
instead he disgustingly blurted out that

324
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,580
he thought this world was unfair

325
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,780
when a man who held people's lives in his hand

326
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,980
should be upset over being jilted by a young girl in her teens.

327
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,080
No way...

328
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,580
That's why I showed him.

329
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,280
I showed him it was even more unfair for a man like him

330
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,880
to be a doctor.

331
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,080
Then, the bottle of poison in Mr. Kamata's car...

332
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,380
Yes, I put it there.

333
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,380
I hid his driver's license

334
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,680
so he would look for it and arouse suspicions.

335
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,580
You were lucky weren't you, Mr. Detective?

336
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,780
That it rained.

337
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,680
If it didn't, you wouldn't have any proof I did it.

338
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,480
No, even if it weren't for your hood,

339
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,580
I would have asked the police to check your clothes anyway.

340
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,780
That's because I already had you pegged as the killer

341
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,180
when I saw that you had the unopened tubs in your pocket.

342
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,680
When you returned from the restroom,

343
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,380
you said the play had already started, isn't that right?

344
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,680
When the play began and the lights went out,

345
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,380
you wouldn't have been able to tell

346
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,380
if your drink was cola or iced coffee even if you took the lid off.

347
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
That's what convinced me.

348
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,680
It told me that you had already opened the lids

349
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,980
and seen that it wasn't iced coffee.

350
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,880
I give up.

351
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
As a fellow alumni of this high school,

352
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,480
I am proud of your brilliance.

353
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,980
We can continue this at the station.

354
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,880
-All right. -Mr. Mitani, Ms. Noda,

355
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
and Ms. Ninagawa,

356
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,380
I'll need your statements, too.

357
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,780
So, could you please come with me to the station?

358
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,580
Yes...

359
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,180
You know, Heiji,

360
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,380
you seemed to be a mere assistant to a great magician today.

361
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,880
Well, that can't be helped.

362
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,380
We're in Tokyo,

363
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,780
I've got to make Kudo look good.

364
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,680
Well, you're as dependable as always!

365
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,780
No, no.

366
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,980
But he's not still in the same league as me.

367
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,080
How about it?

368
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,180
Do you want to sit in on the interrogation, for old times sake?

369
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,580
No, I'll pass this time.

370
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,580
I have something I need to do.

371
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,980
Oh, I see.

372
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,380
And I'd like for you to not let it get out

373
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,580
that I was involved in this case.

374
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,080
That's fine with me,

375
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,580
but you're certainly keeping a low profile these days.

376
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Let's go, Mouri

377
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,080
Yes, Inspector!

378
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,780
Hey, Kudo.

379
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Why didn't you want to watch the interrogation?

380
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,680
Sorry.

381
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,680
A trick is merely a puzzle thought up by someone.

382
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,980
All you have to do

383
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,480
is give it enough thought and eventually,

384
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,780
you'll come up with a logical explanation.

385
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,680
Hey, what's wrong?

386
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,180
It's very frustrating,

387
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,480
no matter how many times it's explained,

388
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,980
I just don't know the rationalization

389
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,880
behind one human being killing another.

390
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
I can understand the emotion,

391
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,180
but I can't accept the action.

392
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,780
It's just beyond me...

393
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,980
Oh, no. It's happening already.

394
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,480
I thought I'd changed back into my old self...

395
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,780
I thought it was going to work out.

396
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,780
This is a test product,

397
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,180
it's a specially mixed antidote for the APTX 4869.

398
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,780
What are you going to do?

399
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,580
It could kill you If you take it, you know.

400
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,880
Are you willing to give it a try?

401
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,180
Shinichi?

402
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,480
What's wrong, Shinichi?

403
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,780
Are you alright?

404
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,080
Does it hurt?

405
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,880
Ran...

406
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,980
It's all over.

407
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,680
If I turn back into Conan here,

408
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,080
Ran will find out about me.

409
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,880
Darn it! My body...

410
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,180
Kudo!

411
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,680
Shinichi?

412
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Shinichi!

413
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,180
What is this smell?

414
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,280
Is this the school infirmary?

415
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,380
Oh, right. I was carried in here.

416
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,680
It's Ran.

417
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,480
She looks pale.

418
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,180
I can't blame her.

419
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,380
She just saw a person shrink right in front of her eyes.

420
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,280
What's this?

421
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,680
Kudo! So, you're awake!

422
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm so glad you re awake.

423
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
Gosh! Don't worry us like that again.

424
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,680
Huh?

425
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,240
"Watch's dial"

427
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,120
-Next time... -Gosh, Ran is consumed by love.

428
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
How long will it last?
