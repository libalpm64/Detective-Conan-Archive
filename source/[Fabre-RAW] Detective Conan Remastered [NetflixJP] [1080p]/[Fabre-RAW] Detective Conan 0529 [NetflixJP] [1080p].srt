1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,985
While we were waiting at the office of Ran's mom,

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,740
we met the former All-Japan women's judo champion

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,240
"Yuko Arisawa (37)" -in the 70kg class,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,991
Yuko Arisawa.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,995
When her husband, Shiro requested Lawyer Kisaki, Ran's mom

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,440
for a consultation over a recent stalker problem.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,001
A meeting was set to meet with them.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,240
Since Shiro suddenly received a call to attend a wake,

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,007
the appointment was re-set for 9:30.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,640
However, when we got there...

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,640
We found Shiro strangled to death.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,021
I and Lawyer Kisaki began to find Yuko's behavior suspicious.

13
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,023
But she has a solid alibi,

14
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,540
since she had been having dinner with us at that time.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,640
The only time she could've committed the murder

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,029
was the 10 minutes that she left to go to the restroom.

17
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:54,840
Could it have been possible for her to kill Shiro in such a short time,

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,140
when she didn't even know where the wake was being held?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,540
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,840
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,540
Kogoro and Eri combined deduction.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,040
Makes a tag-team move on the case.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,740
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:56,897
"Might over Mystery (Part 2)"

27
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:00,159
Maybe they have call forwarding.

28
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,897
That way, if Yuko called here from your office,

29
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:04,163
the call would be forwarded to his cell!

30
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:06,697
You know, when you try calling several times

31
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:10,497
and there is no answer.

32
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,797
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

33
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,897
What?

34
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:16,597
The truth is, before you two made it to the office,

35
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,897
I called here.

36
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:22,197
It was in order to confirm the appointment for tonight.

37
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:24,183
But the call wasn't forwarded,

38
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,097
it went to the answering machine after ten rings.

39
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:31,297
Then, maybe her husband hadn't come home yet,

40
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:33,697
so she called his cell.

41
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:36,197
It wasn't just that phone that's bothering me.

42
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:39,797
Near the closet where the body was discovered

43
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,797
is the door to the garage,

44
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:45,397
but the trash bag there was strange.

45
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,297
What? How so?

46
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:50,897
Maybe it was just placed there to make taking it out easier?

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,697
No. The problem's not where it was, but rather the contents.

48
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,215
A large amount of matchbooks

49
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,597
from the western-style restaurant we ate earlier

50
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:02,897
was found at the bottom of the trash bag.

51
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:05,097
Since she doesn't smoke,

52
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:09,497
it's probably what her heavy-smoker husband brought home with him.

53
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:13,797
In other words, he's also a regular customer at that same restaurant.

54
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:18,237
But if so, why did she say her husband wasn't interested in food,

55
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:22,241
and so she frequented that restaurant alone?

56
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:26,245
If that's the case, why don't you talk it over with Dad?

57
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,497
-What? -Maybe he can find a hint!

58
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,997
I'd rather sell my soul to the devil!

59
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,257
Gosh.

60
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,259
The devil, huh?

61
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,263
What? You found wiretaps?

62
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,597
-Five of them? -Yes, sir!

63
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:51,097
It seems certain that the victim was the target of a stalker.

64
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:54,797
We also found two queer items in the victim's clothing.

65
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,997
-Two? -Yes.

66
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:00,597
One of them was found in the inside the pocket of his slacks.

67
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,281
This wedding ring.

68
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:07,197
What? Then, the victim's missing ring wasn't taken after all.

69
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:08,697
It seems that he took it off for some reason

70
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:11,397
and put it in his pocket.

71
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,597
And the other?

72
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,997
Yes.

73
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:19,997
In his coat pocket, we found this black necktie.

74
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:23,797
Could this be the murder weapon?

75
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:27,497
No, because there aren't any wrinkles on it,

76
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:30,309
and it doesn't even look like it's been opened.

77
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,397
Which means it's not the murder weapon?

78
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,597
Yeah.

79
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,317
Come on, let's give Dad a call.

80
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,997
Dad did say he was going drinking

81
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,597
with the master of Poirot and others tonight,

82
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:45,897
but I'm sure he's not drunk yet.

83
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:49,397
Hey, Mom. Say something!

84
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:52,897
Geez, be quiet! Just quiet down a little!

85
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,337
Hello, Dad?

86
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,297
Mom has something she wants to talk to you about!

87
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,197
What? Eri does?

88
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,297
-Here! -Hey!

89
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:08,697
Well, I doubt think it'll do much good.

90
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:10,349
It's me.

91
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:12,997
Well, it's not really anything important, but...

92
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,355
If it's not anything important, then don't call, idiot!

93
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:20,359
Stop! Don't hang up!

94
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,363
Yeah, yeah, I see.

95
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:29,397
So, you suspect the former All-Japan champion.

96
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:32,697
But when the crime occurred, she was with all of you,

97
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:36,375
and since she didn't even know where the victim went to a wake,

98
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,377
you say it was impossible for her to commit the crime?

99
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,797
Yeah.

100
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:41,997
Then, the answer is simple.

101
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:44,097
That woman is innocent!

102
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,385
-What? -That's it, isn't it?

103
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:50,397
Her alibi is solid and the best evidence is that,

104
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:53,097
you answered the call from the victim yourself!

105
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:56,197
But there are other things that bother me about her.

106
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,397
-Ron! -Ron?

107
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:02,997
Sorry. I'm playing mahjong with the neighbors.

108
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:04,403
Well, that's the story.

109
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,097
So, if you want to find the culprit,

110
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:09,297
I suggest you go looking elsewhere.

111
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,197
What did Dad say?

112
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,097
He says he's busy playing mahjong, so to go look somewhere else.

113
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:18,197
I know he's not playing mahjong.

114
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:19,897
It was recording, a tape recording!

115
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,997
I know because he used it a number of times in the past

116
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,097
when he used to be a police detective!

117
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:27,197
It was the same sound as what he used to use back then, too.

118
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,429
What? What do you mean by sound?

119
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:34,433
In other words, if he doesn't want to let you know his whereabouts,

120
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,097
or when he wants to hang up right away, he used to...

121
00:07:39,697 --> 00:07:43,297
That's it. Her husband didn't want her to know.

122
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,445
That was the reason for the underhanded trick.

123
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,997
Could it be that his trick was seen through without his being aware that

124
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,597
the trick would be carried out on him instead?

125
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:59,397
Despite the various unexplained points that remain,

126
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,597
we can assume that the stalker using the wiretap

127
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,197
found out that no one was at home.

128
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:05,297
While the culprit was ransacking something,

129
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,997
Shiro happened to return from his friend's wake,

130
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,397
and encountered the culprit.

131
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,197
The necktie Shiro was wearing, was taken from him

132
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:13,597
and he was strangled to death.

133
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:17,197
Shiro probably wasn't wearing his necktie or his wedding ring

134
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,597
because he was getting ready to take a bath.

135
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:23,597
I see! The stalker was hiding in the bathroom!

136
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,397
Shiro found him,

137
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,797
so the culprit strangled him with the necktie that Shrio had taken off.

138
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:29,197
The only remaining question is just

139
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:36,495
why Shiro had an unopened black tie package in his suit pocket.

140
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,497
Perhaps someone asked him to buy it?

141
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:40,997
Wakes are generally held without warning.

142
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:42,297
Maybe one of his colleagues

143
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,503
that had to go to the wake directly from work,

144
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,497
asked him to buy the tie

145
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:49,897
but ended up not being able to make it.

146
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,397
I see.

147
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,197
If so, it's understandable that

148
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:55,197
he'd have a brand new extra tie on him!

149
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:59,697
At any rate, at around 9:00 p.m.,

150
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,097
that is, the time the murder was committed

151
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:03,797
after finishing the dinner with Shiro's wife Yuko,

152
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:05,897
we were about to leave the hotel restaurant

153
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:08,797
that is a 10 minute drive from here.

154
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:11,297
So, we've got nothing to do with this case.

155
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,997
May we leave now?

156
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:15,397
I... I guess so.

157
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:18,097
For the time being, we need to find out

158
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:20,539
whether or not anyone suspicious was seen leaving the house.

159
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,097
Go and look into that.

160
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:23,597
Yes, sir!

161
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,197
-Yuko. -Yeah?

162
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:31,597
May I speak to you in the living room for a moment?

163
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:33,397
Sure.

164
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:40,559
So? What's it about?

165
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,397
Article 42, sub-paragraph 01 of the penal code...

166
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:44,563
What?

167
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,797
Criminal offenders who turn themselves in

168
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:49,397
before authorities discover anything

169
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:53,297
will have their sentence reduced.

170
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:57,197
That's why I want you to turn yourself in

171
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,597
for strangling your husband.

172
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,232
Wait! Is this some sort of joke?

173
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:13,632
Didn't you say so earlier?

174
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:15,832
That at the approximate time of the murder, around 9:00,

175
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:19,632
I had just finished having dinner with you at the hotel restaurant

176
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,532
and was about to leave.

177
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:25,132
But just before leaving, you went to the restroom, didn't you?

178
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,532
Just for 10 minutes, right?

179
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,332
What could I have done in such a short time?

180
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,609
Within the 10 minutes,

181
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,432
you could've pretended to go to the restroom, leave the restaurant,

182
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,732
commit the crime and come back to the restaurant, couldn't you?

183
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:41,932
For you, the former All-Japan judo champion in the 70kg class

184
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,623
and for you who currently train others as the coach of a dojo,

185
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,625
it's possible!

186
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,627
What're you talking about?

187
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:51,632
How could I have called my husband over to the hotel

188
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:54,132
when I didn't even know whose wake he was at?

189
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,635
You didn't need to call him over

190
00:10:56,635 --> 00:11:00,232
because your husband was already at the hotel.

191
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:02,932
"Already" there?

192
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,432
You heard him too, didn't you?

193
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:08,232
His voice on the phone saying he was at a wake!

194
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:11,832
So I came to the wake.

195
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,632
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

196
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,032
Don't tell me you're denying hearing that!

197
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,332
The chanting was from a tape.

198
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,661
It was to hide his extra-marital affair, wasn't it?

199
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,132
Extra-marital ffair?

200
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:27,132
My dorky husband use to use the same trick

201
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,667
when he used work for as a police detective!

202
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,332
He would play a recording of patrol car sirens next to the phone

203
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,632
and say "A sudden case has come up,

204
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:37,332
so I'll be home late, go to bed without me."

205
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:41,132
That guy was actually drinking at a cabaret club!

206
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,681
Mom...

207
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,683
I don't see your point in getting angry.

208
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,032
But that was in the case of your husband,

209
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:49,932
my husband would never do that.

210
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:53,232
Prior to taking a bath, do you normally remove your wedding band

211
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:57,132
and store it in your pocket?

212
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:01,132
Now, if he were going out to meet someone else,

213
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,432
it would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

214
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:10,232
And as for that unopened black tie...

215
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:12,432
He planned to put it on before returning home

216
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,332
in order to make it look like he had been to a wake.

217
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:17,332
However, before he could do that,

218
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:21,432
you strangled him with the tie which he took off, didn't you?

219
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,132
And further evidence is the restaurant matchbooks

220
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,232
that were found in the trash bag by the garage door.

221
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:31,032
Your heavy smoker husband brought them back, right?

222
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,731
You also mentioned that

223
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:36,532
you go to the restaurant on a weekly basis.

224
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:39,532
This would mean you both visited that restaurant often.

225
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:42,132
Then, why did you say you only go alone?

226
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:44,432
I come alone without telling him.

227
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,745
My husband has zero tolerance for new food.

228
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,232
Yes. Even though you always went there alone,

229
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:52,032
your husband always had somebody with him.

230
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,232
You saw them, didn't you?

231
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:58,232
Your husband happily enjoying a meal with another woman.

232
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:02,332
They always used that hotel to have an affair.

233
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:05,432
You found out that they were going to have an affair tonight

234
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,832
so you set up wiretaps in the house

235
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,132
and fabricated the story of a stalker.

236
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:16,232
Then, you invited us to that hotel restaurant for dinner.

237
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:20,779
When you contacted your husband on the phone from my office,

238
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,532
you expected him to play something in the background

239
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,783
that he'd prepared as an alibi,

240
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,785
and also predicted he would say

241
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,432
he'd be home late and not to wait up for him.

242
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,789
At just about the same time

243
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,432
that your husband would leave his extra-marital partner

244
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:36,232
and leave the hotel room, you left to go to the restroom.

245
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,797
You then caught your husband in the parking lot

246
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,801
where you proceeded to drag him to your car and strangled him!

247
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,805
Next, you put him in the trunk of your car

248
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,809
and came back as if nothing had happen.

249
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,432
Afterwards, you drove both us and his dead body

250
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,532
together back to your house.

251
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:58,532
You instructed us to wait here in the living room

252
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:02,132
while you transported his body from the trunk to the closet.

253
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,823
And lastly, you called him so we would discover the body.

254
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:09,532
Well, am I wrong?

255
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:15,332
That story sure sounds like a plausible one.

256
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,835
Do you have any proof?

257
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:20,532
We can probably find out by checking the hotel parking lot.

258
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,841
Your husband, who headed home,

259
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,843
had to come alone to the parking lot

260
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,832
or the crime couldn't have been committed!

261
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,232
That's why, it should still be there!

262
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:33,532
The car that your husband drove to the hotel in!

263
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:35,132
Because if your husband used his lover's car

264
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:36,855
to go in and out of the hotel,

265
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,132
you would never have chosen the parking lot to commit the crime,

266
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:44,532
not wanting to risk your face being seen.

267
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:48,632
The garage here only has space for one car.

268
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:52,532
Most likely, your husband rented a car behind your back.

269
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:56,532
Then, why not investigate it? That hotel parking lot!

270
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,032
And, should you not find a car like that,

271
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,432
I will not, despite it being you, attorney at law, Kisaki

272
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:04,532
-get away with it. -Say!

273
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,885
Mrs. Arisawa, you're really good at judo, right?

274
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,432
-What? -Wait, Conan!

275
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:13,832
Could you teach me the inner thigh throw?

276
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:16,895
That's when you use your opponent's attacking power

277
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,897
to your advantage and throw them, right?

278
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:21,632
You use their power to throw them to the ground

279
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:22,901
and gain points, right?

280
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:26,532
Using your opponent's power to your advantage...

281
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,632
Geez! What are you up to?

282
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:29,932
But back then,

283
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:34,913
didn't Mrs. Arisawa teach us how to adjust our seats?

284
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,432
You know how to adjust the seat, don't you?

285
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,917
There's a lever on the right side of the seat.

286
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,232
And if you pull it...

287
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,332
See, like this, the seat will move.

288
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,632
I see.

289
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:50,232
The car that you ended up driving us back in...

290
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:53,632
That was the car your husband drove to the hotel, was it not?

291
00:15:54,732 --> 00:16:00,332
That's why you demonstrated how to adjust the seat, right?

292
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,632
Your husband is smaller and shorter than you.

293
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,432
It's natural for his seat to be in a different position.

294
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:10,949
Should you adjust it on a whim, it would look suspicious.

295
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,332
That's right.

296
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:16,332
That would also explain your adjusting of the rear-view mirror.

297
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:19,232
Which means it should come as no surprise

298
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:22,632
why you couldn't find the car in the parking lot.

299
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,932
Most likely, you trailed him closely

300
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:29,232
and avoided letting him take notice of you.

301
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:30,632
You probably got into the car

302
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,832
at the same time your husband got on and strangled him.

303
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:38,132
Afterwards, you most likely rushed back full speed to the restaurant.

304
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,732
And, due to this, you didn't have enough time

305
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,832
to remember the car position, right?

306
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:46,732
If you think about it, it's really a strange story.

307
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:50,332
Your reason for inviting us to that hotel

308
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,991
was because you could get a discount for parking.

309
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,732
Then, you should've shown the ticket when you paid the parking fee.

310
00:16:57,732 --> 00:16:59,532
Despite not having gone anywhere else,

311
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:03,001
the ticket was suspiciously missing.

312
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,432
This is peculiar, isn't it?

313
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,232
When you said you had lost the ticket, what you really meant was

314
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:12,532
that you weren't sure where your husband put it, right?

315
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,632
If your husband were the type to put things away at random,

316
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,432
it could be behind the sun visor

317
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,732
or even in the ashtray.

318
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:21,932
With a proper search of the car,

319
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,432
I imagine we'll find it.

320
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:27,432
The hotel parking ticket with your husband's fingerprints on it.

321
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:29,432
That would be proof that

322
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:33,032
your husband was also at the hotel tonight.

323
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,532
Well, if we check the trunk,

324
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:39,432
we should find evidence that he was moved from there.

325
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,032
Maybe his hair

326
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:44,432
and possibly even the tie used as a weapon,

327
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,132
as well as his shoes.

328
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:50,532
And as for the shoes that we saw at the front entrance tonight,

329
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:53,332
those were likely prepared by you.

330
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:56,732
Now, before the police come across this evidence,

331
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,432
hurry and turn yourself in.

332
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:01,332
-The sock on his left foot... -What?

333
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,061
I just remembered.

334
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:07,065
That's where my husband usually puts his parking tickets.

335
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,732
So if they check there, they should find it.

336
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:12,432
Then, Yuko really did...

337
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:13,932
But why?

338
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:18,532
How could someone like you esort to murder over a mere affair?

339
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:22,532
If it were only an affair, a divorce would have sufficed,

340
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,932
but the other woman was Kajimoto's wife.

341
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,032
I just couldn't allow it.

342
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,632
Mr. Kajimoto...

343
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:32,232
That's the gold medallist you mentioned before, right?

344
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:36,132
But wouldn't that give you even mere reason to work it out?

345
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:39,097
It isn't like you weren't acquainted with his wife.

346
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,099
Yeah, my husband and I

347
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:45,103
visited Kajimoto's house often in the past.

348
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,232
Such a good wife, such a cute child...

349
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:51,132
They were the ideal family you see in pictures.

350
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,532
But my husband ruined it!

351
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:59,832
When I considered the suffering that was to come,

352
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:02,432
I couldn't live on that way.

353
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,123
Not even a divorce would've been enough!

354
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:09,432
Right. I never should've gotten close.

355
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:12,632
If only we never visited Mr. Kajimoto's house,

356
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:16,132
my husband and his wife wouldn't have met.

357
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,132
If only I had kept my admiration to myself,

358
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:21,139
none of this would have come to be.

359
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:25,143
This is merely an assumption.

360
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:29,132
Could it be that your husband just wanted more attention from you?

361
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:31,932
-What? -The tape trick for an alibi

362
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:33,532
would have only worked two, maybe three times.

363
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:35,153
After that, it doesn't work anymore.

364
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:39,157
And, when it comes to those matches from the restaurant...

365
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,732
He may as well have told you directly that he went there often.

366
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,432
Are you saying my husband

367
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:46,532
deliberately wanted me to think he was having an affair?

368
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,167
Yes. He was jealous

369
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,632
that you still thought of Mr. Kajimoto despite being married.

370
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:55,432
That can't be...

371
00:19:55,432 --> 00:20:00,032
But he crossed the line and angered you, caught fire,

372
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,932
and plunged to his death.

373
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:06,332
Maybe the sun that burned Icarus's wings

374
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:08,932
was actually you.

375
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:16,532
-It was all thanks to Dad! -What?

376
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,197
You know, the alibi tapes!

377
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:21,199
A coincidence! Just a coincidence!

378
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,932
Definitely an accidental hit!

379
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,203
Was it really a coincidence?

380
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:30,032
What if it was a deliberate hint just for Mom?

381
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:33,211
No way.

382
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,632
He was probably too embarrassed to say anything!

383
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:37,215
Is that so?

384
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,732
If you want to find out, here's the phone!

385
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:44,932
Well, I should at least inform him that the case is over.

386
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:49,532
It's me.

387
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,632
About the case...

388
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:57,232
Sorry, I'm still playing mahjong.

389
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:59,237
Silly, still using those tapes.

390
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,732
Kogoro, hurry!

391
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,241
Darn it!

392
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,432
This is...

393
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:10,432
What?

394
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:13,732
As I thought, it was just a coincidence.

395
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,532
How do you know?

396
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:19,032
Mom! Wait up!

397
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,345
It looks like Pop's back already.

398
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,732
Oh, really? Who cares!

399
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:51,732
Lewd old man!

400
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,032
"Tonight's drinking party has been canceled!"

401
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:58,632
"Sorry about that, Kogorou. - Poirot Master"

402
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:06,232
I see.

403
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:08,632
Since he'd used this strategy so often before,

404
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:11,132
he saw throught it instantly.

405
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:13,032
And he was able to find his own alibi tapes so quickly

406
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:15,632
because he skipped on the party.

407
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:22,332
Then, he tried to play it one more time over the last call, but...

408
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:25,032
Kogoro, hurry!

409
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:27,932
Next, we'll have a friend of the groom, Kogoro Mouri,

410
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:28,932
give a congratulatory speech!

411
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,532
Thank you!

412
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:34,732
What a bad luck, recording that part

413
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:36,632
and accidentally playing it as well.

414
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,432
Yes, quite a pity!

415
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:42,332
Eri! Don't be fooled!

416
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:44,632
Do your best!

417
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:48,632
You too, Pops!

418
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,411
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,140
"Hammer man"

420
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,222
Next story is a love story.

421
00:23:58,222 --> 00:23:59,720
Please stay happy.
