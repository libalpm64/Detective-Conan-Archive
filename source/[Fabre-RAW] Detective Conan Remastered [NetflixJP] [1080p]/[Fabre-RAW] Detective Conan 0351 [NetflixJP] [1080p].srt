1
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,895
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:06,995
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:08,695
Tracking down a cell phone case leads us to

4
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:10,495
revealing an unexpected case.

5
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:11,895
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:13,895
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,295
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:03,156
"Forgotten Cell Phone (Part 2)"

9
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,656
Thank you very much!

10
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,556
Yes.

11
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:10,556
I see. Yes.

12
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,756
I understand.

13
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,256
Yes, thank you.

14
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,456
And?

15
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,256
I found three prospective people!

16
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:18,956
They called from day before yesterday to today.

17
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:21,556
Three people?

18
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,356
And? What did they have to say?

19
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:27,356
The first one said he wanted to go the interview site of a company

20
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,456
but forgot the paper that he had written the address on at home

21
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:34,756
and said he may be excluded from the interview if they found out.

22
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,856
And asked to somehow have them give him the address.

23
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,356
The second call was from a man

24
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:42,756
who said his daughter who had run away from home

25
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,756
and that he wanted to specify

26
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:47,756
from where the phone call was placed.

27
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:50,156
The third call was from a person who said that the cell phone

28
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,356
of a person who he had befriended during his trip

29
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:55,756
was mistakenly mixed up in his bag.

30
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,556
He wanted to thank that person

31
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:59,256
as well as return the cell phone

32
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:03,056
so he wanted the name and address of that person.

33
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,256
He's the one!

34
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,956
He's the only one who mentioned cell phone so far!

35
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:08,256
Yes!

36
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,156
On top of that, only this last person

37
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,656
asked to have the phone number too.

38
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,756
And, what's the number?

39
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:17,356
Well, since they were going to refuse answering him,

40
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:20,356
they didn't take his number down.

41
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:23,056
Besides, all three seem to have called from outside

42
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,956
and not their residence,

43
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,656
so they don't know who called at all.

44
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,856
-From outside? -Yup.

45
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,556
One called the day before yesterday

46
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,556
from the platform of Beika Station,

47
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:35,656
the next one called yesterday at noon from sports shop Apollo

48
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:37,256
and yesterday at sundown

49
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,956
another called from Restaurant Colombo.

50
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,656
The problem is...

51
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,856
they don't remember which person it was

52
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:49,856
that asked for the cell phone number.

53
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,856
Oh, right.

54
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,256
It seems that only the person who asked for the phone number

55
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:57,056
suddenly hung the phone up from his side.

56
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,156
Suddenly?

57
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,556
Yes. They say they heard a sound

58
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,356
on the other side of the line at that time.

59
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:04,556
A sound that interrupted conversation.

60
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,156
A loud sound.

61
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,556
Well, it seems to have been so sudden that

62
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:14,356
they didn't seem to have time to make out what the sound of the was.

63
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:17,156
I guess we have no choice but to get in touch

64
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,556
with the place that these three people called.

65
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:23,556
I've passed one of the universities that I applied.

66
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,456
Oh, I'm happy for you!

67
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:26,656
Thanks.

68
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,656
I guess you're relieved.

69
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,156
Here's your change.

70
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:33,256
Now, for the first one.

71
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:34,356
Yes.

72
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,356
The Tohto Kanjo Line will be coming in shortly!

73
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:42,156
What? The public phone on the platform?

74
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,756
The night before last.

75
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:47,856
There were many passengers using the phone so...

76
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,956
I thought so.

77
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,756
I mean I understand.

78
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:54,956
Hey! Could it be that guy?

79
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:57,056
You know that person who was standing in front of the phone

80
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:59,556
that looked to be contemplating whether to call or not.

81
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:02,756
Come to think of it, yeah.

82
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,156
He was wearing this expensive looking coat,

83
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,156
with a frightening and taut look.

84
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:10,056
He comes around to the station recently.

85
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,456
Didn't you hear a loud sound in the background

86
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,056
when this person was on the phone?

87
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:15,156
A loud sound?

88
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:16,256
Yes.

89
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:19,556
Of course, all the time!

90
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,742
Because this is a train station after all. See!

91
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:26,242
The train for Kenbashi will be coming shortly.

92
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,642
Please stand behind the white line.

93
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:28,742
Oh!

94
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:31,342
The announcement at the train station!

95
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:34,642
-Hello? -It's true that you can hardly hear.

96
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:37,556
Hello!

97
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:40,656
Did you hear that? That's the loud sound.

98
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,056
Thank you. I understand very well now.

99
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,856
But, do you happen to have any other information

100
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,756
on that frightening man?

101
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:51,256
Yeah, maybe I'll see him again tonight.

102
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:54,156
I see him a lot recently on the platform.

103
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:57,156
Well, if you see him, please contact us!

104
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,456
Yes, all right.

105
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:02,756
Thank you for your help!

106
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:05,156
Yes!

107
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,756
About noon yesterday, there was a man with a short hair cut

108
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:10,956
that came here asking to use the phone. He's the one, right?

109
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:13,756
He said that the battery of his cell phone went dead

110
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:15,056
and that he had no loose change either,

111
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:18,056
so he wanted to borrow the phone.

112
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,756
A loud noise?

113
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:20,856
Yes.

114
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,356
Was there noise loud enough back then

115
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,956
that you had to stop talking?

116
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:28,956
Yeah. I'm sure you're referring to the sound of the construction

117
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:33,056
that's been going on for about a week in front of the bank.

118
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,456
See! It's started again!

119
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,356
It's like this intermittently from a little after noon time!

120
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:43,056
The sound of construction.

121
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,856
Huh? About sundown yesterday?

122
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:50,456
Oh! He must be one of our customers!

123
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:54,456
He's reticent and always wearing light colored sunglasses.

124
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,056
He unusually seems to have forgotten his cell phone

125
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,256
and asked for loose change in order to use the phone.

126
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,256
So, I remember him well.

127
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,856
Huh? A loud noise?

128
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:10,056
Yes, did you hear a noise loud enough that you had to stop talking?

129
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:14,156
I wonder. This road is known for being quiet.

130
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:16,956
Hello, everyone!

131
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,756
I, Shuhei Baisho with your ballot, with you voting for me

132
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:26,756
will work along with you to create a quiet town!

133
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,156
Did you hear that loud sound?

134
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,056
It's like this every noon and at sundown.

135
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:33,956
It seems that the campaign car usually takes this route.

136
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,956
A political campaign car.

137
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,856
When will that customer come to your shop again?

138
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,956
He comes everyday,

139
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:43,056
so when he comes again, I'll give you a call.

140
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,756
Thank you. I'll be waiting for you to call me then.

141
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,356
All of them sure sound suspicious.

142
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:53,256
All of the three cases seem to fit the description.

143
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,256
This is?

144
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,756
Huh?

145
00:07:56,756 --> 00:08:01,256
What's this? This cell phone is strange!

146
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:03,356
Look at it, Pops. See.

147
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:07,156
Kid! Don't tell me you broke it?

148
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:11,656
No. The phone numbers that are saved in this cell phone.

149
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,956
Most of them start with the same four numbers.

150
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:20,956
1028.

151
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:24,156
1025. True.

152
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:26,156
Almost all the figures are similar.

153
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:29,456
Maybe they all live in the same neighborhood!

154
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:31,356
Stupid! I just told you

155
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:35,756
that there are no 10 digit numbers that start with 1.

156
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:40,056
I'm pretty sure that the owner of this cell phone, that chubby man

157
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:42,456
who got to know people on the job or something,

158
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,056
put numbers in order besides their names.

159
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:49,056
Hey. Among those numbers, which are the smallest ones?

160
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,156
This is it.

161
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,856
It's more than 1,000. He sure knows a lot of people.

162
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:01,656
Yeah. Maybe he was a door to door sales man

163
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:04,956
and just numbering his customers.

164
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:07,656
Then what is the number behind it supposed to be?

165
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:10,656
And this! What about this black dot?

166
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:13,956
Some are marked and some are not.

167
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,456
Maybe he marked the people

168
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:21,356
who are prospective buyers with the black dot.

169
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:26,156
The number towards the end like "150" and "600"

170
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,756
could be number of products he sold, or...

171
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:31,456
If so, that's strange?

172
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:33,556
Because there are no people before the numbers 1022,

173
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,356
that are at the start of the all the numbers,

174
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,856
and see look carefully!

175
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:41,456
There are two people with the number "1031"!

176
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:43,456
One.

177
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,156
Two.

178
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:46,556
True.

179
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:47,756
And, this too.

180
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,056
There's a person numbered 1101

181
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:54,956
but why isn't there anyone with the numbers 1032 to 1100?

182
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:57,356
If he was numbering everyone in order,

183
00:09:57,356 --> 00:10:01,356
why does the number jump suddenly from 1031 to 1101?

184
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,556
Could it be that...

185
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:07,156
it's a calendar?

186
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,356
Calendar?

187
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:11,656
1031, October 31st.

188
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:15,256
1101, November 1st and so forth.

189
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:16,856
I see!

190
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:18,856
Everything falls in place that way.

191
00:10:18,856 --> 00:10:20,256
Hold it.

192
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:23,656
If this number stands for the end of October last year

193
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,456
and this other one the 1st of November,

194
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,556
it's just about the time the Tohto Congress election was held.

195
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:29,456
Oh!

196
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:33,456
Besides, back then it was a pretty busy time

197
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,056
with the community baseball tournament

198
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:36,956
and preparations for the autumn festival and all.

199
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:41,156
So, it's for sure that this guy's not from this community.

200
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:43,556
Hey! That's not the point.

201
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:45,356
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:46,356
No problem.

203
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:49,656
If the four digits at the top are dates,

204
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:53,956
the numbers behind them could be the time that he made the visit.

205
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:55,956
"150", 1:50.

206
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,156
"600", 6:00 sharp.

207
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,456
Then why are the surnames written in Kanji

208
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:02,056
and the names in Katakana?

209
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,156
Because when he visits the house,

210
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,556
the surname is written on the name plate,

211
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:10,756
but he can only get the name of the person after he talks to them.

212
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:14,656
It could be that the person was angry at the guy

213
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:17,056
for selling him something he didn't want.

214
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,856
What? Who?

215
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:20,956
The guy who called using an a number that was not displayed.

216
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,956
The one who shouted for the owner of the cell phone to take the call.

217
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:25,456
And the same one who called the telephone company

218
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,756
asking for the name and address of the owner of the cell phone.

219
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:30,356
The man with the frightening face.

220
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,356
If we can find out who and where he is,

221
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:36,656
we can get the phone number of this cell phone from him

222
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:40,756
and figure out the identity of the chubby guy.

223
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:46,956
Darn! We wouldn't have to think so hard if that guy didn't die.

224
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,356
I wonder if that's how it really is.

225
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,556
It's strange after all.

226
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:55,256
The place where that cell phone was forgotten.

227
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,456
It's strange that it was folded in two,

228
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,056
with the antenna sticking out and under the sofa.

229
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,956
That's true, that it's strange.

230
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,456
It's as if the cell phone was asking for someone to find it.

231
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:06,756
Talking of the phone ringing,

232
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:10,056
the gruff person who was the second one to call said,

233
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:12,256
"Did it ring?"

234
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:17,856
Maybe the chubby man made the gruff man call

235
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:22,156
and was planning to secretly give him the cell phone.

236
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,556
Don't be silly.

237
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:27,756
Then, why didn't he call the gruff man over to this shop?

238
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:32,056
If the phone rings, the employee of the shop would find it first

239
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:34,256
and he could never give it away secretly, could he?

240
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:37,056
Exactly! It's just as Pops says!

241
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,556
-Right? -He would never come back for something

242
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,356
he was planning to hand over secretly!

243
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:46,156
He couldn't have made mistake as to the place either.

244
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,256
Mistake?

245
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,356
You know, like I always make a mistake too.

246
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,356
Come to think of it, before getting run over,

247
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,756
the chubby man asked for directions at the convenience store.

248
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:58,056
I see! That's right.

249
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,056
If he wasn't familiar with this place,

250
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:02,556
there's a possibility of him making a mistake.

251
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:05,756
Then, the most suspicious would be...

252
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:06,956
Apollo!

253
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:09,656
He could've made a mistake because this shop Poirot

254
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,156
sounds similar to Apollo, the sports shop?

255
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:13,556
I see!

256
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:17,256
But, Azusa, I think it's hard to believe that

257
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,856
he'd mistake a sports shop for this coffee shop, don't you?

258
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,956
I guess so.

259
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,456
Azusa!

260
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:27,756
Why is the name of this shop called Poirot?

261
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:32,456
Yup. I wonder if you know, Hercule Poirot.

262
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:36,156
The master likes him, that's where we got the name!

263
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,356
Conan, do you know Poirot?

264
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:40,056
The man's that a bit plump.

265
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:42,656
Yup! I've seen him on TV!

266
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,156
He's the one that always says, "You know, my wife she..."

267
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:47,856
The detective that's wearing the wrinkled up coat, right?

268
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:49,456
No!

269
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,256
He's not Poirot, but Colom...

270
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,456
Bo...

271
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,356
Don't tell me!

272
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:58,756
Maybe he made a mistake because they're both detectives?

273
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:02,056
Besides, Colombo is located on 5-chome like we are.

274
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,956
So, if that chubby man

275
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:07,956
remembered the shop as one on 5-chome that has the name of detective,

276
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:10,556
it's understandable that he would make a mistake.

277
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,456
Let's go!

278
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:13,456
Where to?

279
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:14,956
Where else?

280
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:17,656
The other detective's shop!

281
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,656
-Wait! -Hey! I'm going too!

282
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:21,956
Me too!

283
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:25,356
The identity of the chubby man is becoming clear!

284
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:35,917
The man with the sunglasses that I told you about over the phone

285
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,317
hasn't come yet.

286
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:38,517
Oh, yeah?

287
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:41,117
Could we wait for him here, then?

288
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:42,217
Yeah.

289
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,217
Are you going to be all right, Azusa,

290
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,717
taking off from work like this?

291
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,917
Yes. Master's there

292
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,017
and as long as go back by sundown when it'll start getting busy.

293
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,017
I'm so concerned that I can't work this way anyway.

294
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,117
Hey, mister!

295
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:57,117
Did that customer ask you something?

296
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:58,417
Yeah.

297
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,917
From just a while ago, each time he comes here, he keeps asking me

298
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,717
whether anybody found a forgotten cell phone here.

299
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,917
Just as I thought.

300
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:10,017
-There seems to be no doubt about it. -Right.

301
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,617
Oh! There he is.

302
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:15,517
Welcome!

303
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:20,517
It's him. But what did you want with him?

304
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:22,517
Oh, just a little something.

305
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,617
I'll go talk to him.

306
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,117
If I talk to him, I'm pretty sure I can tell

307
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,917
whether he's the person who called or not.

308
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,117
No! I'll go first!

309
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:36,017
-Huh? -In times like this, men should go first.

310
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:42,917
What's the matter, Mr. Detective?

311
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,217
Aren't you going to go talk to him?

312
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:50,517
Talk to that man after you hear my deduction out.

313
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:55,417
First for the strange names in Katakana that were in this cell phone.

314
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,617
Although it's made to look like names of people at first glance,

315
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:01,417
these are actually the short form of a certain name.

316
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,917
A certain name?

317
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,917
Please show me the cell phone.

318
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,417
Just what do you mean?

319
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,417
There are names that are saved on the cell phone

320
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,817
that are very unnatural as names of people, aren't there?

321
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:16,817
Could you be referring to Sho Kenbashi and Chiyo Daitoma?

322
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:20,717
True. I've heard of places named like that,

323
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:23,617
but not so with the names of people.

324
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:28,317
Right! Those probably are the names of place.

325
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:30,917
For example, Sho Kenbashi stands for Kenbashi Shopping Arcade

326
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,217
and Chiyo Daitoma stands for Daitoma Community.

327
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:36,917
True that it falls into place if so.

328
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,217
Ken Aida stands for Aida Construction Company.

329
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:42,417
Seisaku Ishizawa stands for Ishizawa Manufacturing Company.

330
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,017
Furthermore, the 10 digit numbers that are

331
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:47,817
registered together with the names.

332
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,717
The 4 numbers at the top are dates.

333
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,717
The numbers after that denotes cash,

334
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,217
and the black dot shows that the company in question

335
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:54,717
is in the black.

336
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:57,017
In other words, it's about income.

337
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,017
The ones without the black dot means just the opposite.

338
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,517
That is, expense.

339
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,917
If you consider that the dates are focused

340
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,317
during the election time of last year,

341
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,117
-there is just one answer. -It can't be.

342
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:10,517
Under-the-counter accounting book of election campaign funds?

343
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,917
Exactly.

344
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,817
I have no idea how the chubby man

345
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:17,017
got a hold of the under-counter accounting book,

346
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:22,717
but there's probably no mistake that he was extorting money for this.

347
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:26,217
He probably put the copy of the accounting book into the cell phone

348
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:30,817
to show the one he was extorting that he really had the info.

349
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,817
Which means that the man is...

350
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,517
Most probably some man hired by Congressman Baisho,

351
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:39,417
who runs his election campaign car through this area.

352
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,517
-What? -He probably

353
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,717
wanted to get back the under-the-counter accounting book.

354
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:48,017
That man hung up part way calling the telephone company.

355
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:52,217
Because he heard the Shuhei Baisho's election car coming.

356
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:55,417
He didn't want people to think that anybody connected to Baisho

357
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:58,717
was searching for somebody who had information on the account book,

358
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,517
so he hung up without thinking.

359
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:04,117
The one who chose this shop as the place to get the info,

360
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:07,517
is that man wearing sunglasses, who frequents this shop.

361
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,217
He was supposed to ring the cell phone here

362
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:12,217
and secretly get hold of the information

363
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,717
but the chubby man made a mistake!

364
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:19,917
But, I wonder why the chubby man didn't call our shop

365
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,417
after he realized he made a mistake?

366
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,117
Probably because he realized

367
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:29,717
only after the time he promised to ring the cell phone.

368
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,917
Because if it worked out the way it should have,

369
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,417
the chef of this shop was supposed to have found the cell phone

370
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:36,317
and the man wearing the sunglasses was supposed to come pick it up

371
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,017
as something he forgot.

372
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:41,017
Even if he went to the wrong shop, if he calls the cell phone,

373
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,317
the guys could come pick it up at Poirot.

374
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:49,517
But he didn't want the guys to hear his voice.

375
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:55,317
So, he probably carried everything out using faxes and e-mails,

376
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:58,117
because he didn't want the guys to get anything on him,

377
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,417
including his face and voice that would identify him.

378
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,417
That's why he even ended the contract with the cell phone company

379
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:07,017
and peeled off the product number.

380
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:11,517
Then why did the chubby man rush back to Poirot?

381
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,917
He wanted to confirm whether the man wearing the sunglasses

382
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,017
really got hold of the cell phone.

383
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,617
Because if someone picked it up and delivered it to the police,

384
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,817
his plans for getting cash would go down the drain.

385
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,617
But, under these circumstances,

386
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,617
that man wearing the sunglasses

387
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:29,317
would probably refuse to talk no matter what we ask him.

388
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:32,117
-Don't worry, there's still a way. -Huh?

389
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,717
Okay, Conan?

390
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,217
Yup!

391
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,517
Let's go, Azusa!

392
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:37,517
Huh?

393
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:40,317
-Hurry! -Conan?

394
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:46,117
Hey, Azusa! I wonder who forgot that cell phone.

395
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:48,717
If the owner can't be found, give it to me, okay?

396
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:50,617
This is the first time I've seen a cell phone

397
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,417
with such a strange pattern!

398
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:56,117
Huh? There are many strange names and letters in it!

399
00:19:56,117 --> 00:19:57,217
Conan.

400
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,917
Hey you! Kid!

401
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,217
I mean, sonny.

402
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,617
You see, that's my phone.

403
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,017
What? Really?

404
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:08,617
Then, show me proof!

405
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,217
Proof?

406
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:11,517
Yup, if this is yours,

407
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:14,817
you should know the number of this cell phone, right?

408
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:18,317
I'll call it with my cell phone and see if it really works.

409
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,117
Will you give me the cell phone number?

410
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,317
Cut out the blabbering, hurry up and...

411
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:25,317
There's a policewoman!

412
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,217
I think I'll give this to that policewoman.

413
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:30,917
Hold it. Okay.

414
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:34,717
I'll give you the number now.

415
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:38,817
I got hold of the chubby man's phone number,

416
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,517
and from that number the police tracked down the apartment

417
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,517
where the chubby man lived.

418
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:47,317
The man seems to have been a journalist

419
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,217
and a copy of the under-the-counter account book

420
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:52,717
was found buried below a heap of receipts.

421
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:56,517
The names, dates and amount of cash were clearly written in it

422
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:59,917
and it was more than enough to serve as evidence.

423
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,517
All the people who received money from

424
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:03,017
or who were given money from Congressman Baisho

425
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,517
during the election campaign

426
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:07,717
were arrested, one after the other.

427
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:35,417
"Cafe Poirot"

428
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,017
Welcome!

429
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:39,117
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

430
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:41,217
A cup of hot coffee, please!

431
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:43,417
I'm an unknown detective that is fighting

432
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,817
with the dark aspects of society.

433
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,417
No, let me revise what I just said.

434
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:52,117
I am Kogoro Mouri, a renown detective!

435
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:53,917
Hello!

436
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:57,017
Thank you so very much for yesterday.

437
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:00,017
If anything should ever come up again, make sure you tell me, okay?

438
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:01,417
Yes, sir.

439
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:04,217
Yes, there is no case that I cannot solve.

440
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,117
Take for instance, that student.

441
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:08,017
He has successfully passed the university exam,

442
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:10,317
and doesn't have to come here to study anymore,

443
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:12,317
and yet he comes here frequently.

444
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:15,517
I'm sure that something else is blossoming inside him now.

445
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:17,717
A case!

446
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,417
Yes! This is Detective Mouri.

447
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,917
Hello, dad?

448
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,017
It's me.

449
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:25,717
Yup, what is it?

450
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:27,717
I think I'm going to be a bit late because of club practice today,

451
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:29,717
so could you go shopping for me?

452
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:32,317
Yes. Of course.

453
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:35,917
Potatoes.

454
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:39,417
Carrots, onions, pork, and apples!

455
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,117
Yep.

456
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:43,917
I figure we're going to be having curry tonight?

457
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,917
Bull's eye! Just as expected of a great detective!

458
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:49,217
Okay, got you! It sure is an important case!

459
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:51,217
I'll head off to the site immediately!

460
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:53,217
-Oh, no! -What's the matter, dad?

461
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:56,517
Hot, my coffee! My coffee!

462
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:59,617
Business sure is slow, eh, Pops?

463
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:34,444
Next Conan's Hint:

464
00:24:34,444 --> 00:24:36,144
"Trolley track"

465
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:38,744
Fishing? You caught nothing, right?

466
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:39,644
Well, it's way better than

467
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,990
not fishing at all and just holding buckets.
