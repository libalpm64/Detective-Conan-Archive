1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,440
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,140
Kogoro the suspect is in a real pinch.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,340
Only a certain person can save him.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,590
The three of us are staying in a hotel here in Karuizawa,

9
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,590
where by mere chance, we run into Eri Kisaki who is also here

10
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,290
with a group of her lawyer colleagues.

11
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,490
Later that night,

12
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,790
Kogoro becomes drunk and when he doesn't return to his room,

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,190
we go looking for him, discover the body of fellow lawyer,

14
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,390
Ritsuko Usui in her locked room.

15
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,290
On top of that, we find Kogoro asleep in that room.

16
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,490
Naturally, Kogoro is considered the prime suspect

17
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,290
and he is taken to the station for questioning.

18
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,890
We are left behind and...

19
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,190
Mom, are you saying the reason you didn't go with dad to the station

20
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,890
was you wanted to check things out here.

21
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,290
Of course, silly.

22
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,790
I've known him much longer than you.

23
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,790
Sure, I was angry at first but I know better than anyone

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,090
that he isn't capable of murder.

25
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,090
"Kogoro Mouri The Suspect (Part 2)"

26
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,990
"I'm very sorry, please tell him I'll repay the money,"

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,290
that sounds strange.

28
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,090
It seems hard to believe

29
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,690
but it sounds like there was a money matter between the two lawyers.

30
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,390
I know for a fact Miss Usui, the victim and Mr. Hayashi have never met.

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,290
Besides, I hadn't even told her about him yet,

32
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,190
so they couldn't possibly have been making a money deal.

33
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,790
I didn't think so either.

34
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,490
And Mr. Hayashi, who would be working with her

35
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,690
wanted to contact her as soon as possible.

36
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,590
So he asked Mr. Shiozawa, one of her colleagues

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,490
where she could be reached and called her here.

38
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,690
And judging from the memo we found in the waste basket

39
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,390
and the bell boy's statement,

40
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,490
it is certain they were going to meet the next day at 2 o'clock.

41
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,990
But how do you explain the note on the door?

42
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,490
I remember you.

43
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,290
I'm positive you were with Miss Yukiko

44
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,290
when I was working on another case in the past.

45
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,290
I knew I'd seen this guy somewhere before.

46
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,090
He's that incompetent officer with the Gunma Prefectural Police.

47
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,990
Oh, that...

48
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,890
What are you doing here, Karuizawa is in Nagano prefecture, isn't it?

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,890
Yes, but this place is right on the borderline

50
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,690
and it's in our jurisdiction.

51
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,890
So, you've met Yukiko and this boy before?

52
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,390
Yes, I think her husband came later though.

53
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,390
They certainly caused a lot of trouble,

54
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,190
disrupting our investigation and all.

55
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,790
Especially this kid.

56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,690
That grouchy man was guilty, wasn't he?

57
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,990
Yeah, I guess.

58
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,790
Officer Yamamura.

59
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,290
Are you sure about that?

60
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,990
Madam, I regret saying this,

61
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,690
but it seems your husband is guilty.

62
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,890
Your husband's fingerprints were on the telephone cord which was the murder weapon!

63
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,890
And on top of that,

64
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,590
we have witnesses from the bar stating that your husband was drunk and making advances to Miss Usui.

65
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,190
I'm almost positive your husband is the murderer!

66
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,590
Now wait just a minute, weren't you listening?

67
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,090
I told you there were no marks from the cord on my husband's hands.

68
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,690
He's a top notch private detective.

69
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,790
In other words, he's a crime specialist.

70
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,790
He'd know how to avoid getting marks on his hands.

71
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,490
But just because he was drunk and having a fight?

72
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,490
The real motive though, is probably his job.

73
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,490
He sees mutilated bodies nearly every day

74
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,490
and he snapped, he decided he wanted to commit a murder too.

75
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,990
That's scary.

76
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,890
This is bad.

77
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,790
If we let this dummy handle the case,

78
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,890
he'll get Kogoro convicted for real.

79
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,090
Listen. I found something weird by the door.

80
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,290
See, here, here.

81
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,290
Hey?

82
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,090
If you're talking about the thread,

83
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,690
I gave it to the officers from the crime lab.

84
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,990
Thread?

85
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,290
Yes.

86
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,090
I found it.

87
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,690
It was about three centimeters long with one end tied.

88
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,990
It was on the floor along with a piece of the door chain

89
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,490
which probably flew off when the door was forced open.

90
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,690
Then did you take a good look at that piece of chain?

91
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,290
Yes, I did.

92
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,590
I saw a strange mark on it.

93
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,190
Then...

94
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,590
That's right.

95
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,290
I'm pretty sure I figured out the trick

96
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,290
as to how the room was locked, but...

97
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,590
Trick?

98
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,490
But...

99
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,190
I know, proof.

100
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,090
We know why the killer used the telephone cord to commit the murder,

101
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,090
and why Kogoro's phone was left by the door,

102
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,690
and even why the sign was left on the door,

103
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,090
we even know who the killer is

104
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,090
but there's no proof.

105
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,590
Do you have that MD player I bought for you?

106
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,790
Right here, but...

107
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,990
Can I borrow it?

108
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,490
I can't think straight unless I listen to music.

109
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,490
What I can't figure out is that strange note on the door.

110
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,890
Hey?

111
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,490
There's no music on this disk.

112
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,490
You're kidding.

113
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,890
Wait. You're pressing the record button.

114
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,890
Oh no.

115
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,490
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,590
The MD player we have in the office is only used for recording,

117
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,490
I pressed it without thinking.

118
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,090
Good grief.

119
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,690
Without thinking?

120
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,790
Wait a minute.

121
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,790
I'm pretty sure it was on the desk.

122
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,690
I'm pretty sure. Yes, I'm sure.

123
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,790
I see, so that's why that person left that note.

124
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,190
No. You mustn't do that.

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,590
You shouldn't stand on chairs with your shoes on.

126
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,290
But I'm hungry.

127
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,190
Sometimes you act like such an adult

128
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,890
but sometimes you're such a little kid.

129
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,590
I can't help it, I'm starving.

130
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,190
All right.

131
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,990
I'll order you something from room service later.

132
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,490
What you just said?

133
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,890
Saku.

134
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,890
How did it go? How is he doing at the station?

135
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,190
Actually, it seems Mr. Mouri was so drunk,

136
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,390
he doesn't know why he was in her room

137
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,390
even the police can't believe he's the suspect

138
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,090
so they're in a state of confusion too.

139
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,790
I see.

140
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,590
Ms. Kisaki, I hate to say this

141
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,990
but your husband is the only one who could've done it.

142
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,490
Miss Usui's room was locked from the inside.

143
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,290
And Mr. Mouri was asleep in her bed.

144
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,290
There's the issue of how he killed her.

145
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,290
It would be considered accidental death

146
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,890
if she died as a result of say, hitting her head against something

147
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,190
when he pushed her while he was in a drunken stupor,

148
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,190
but she was strangled to death with a telephone cord.

149
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,190
That's first degree murder.

150
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,090
I agree, he stands to face a minimum sentence of 10 years

151
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,390
if he's charged with murder and rape,

152
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,590
at worst, it'll be a life sentence

153
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,790
and there's always the possibility of the death penalty.

154
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,990
Mom, how can you say that?

155
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,590
Didn't you just say, someone else did it?

156
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,790
Oh that... I guess I was wrong after all.

157
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,690
By the way, Ms. Kisaki, did you want to ask me something?

158
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,090
Yes, there's was something I just couldn't figure out

159
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,090
so I thought I'd get your opinion.

160
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,890
Your specialty is criminal law, isn't it?

161
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,090
So I thought you'd know more about these things.

162
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,090
Come on, let's go.

163
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,090
Ms. Kisaki.

164
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,290
Mom!

165
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,590
What do think will happen to that trial?

166
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,490
You know the case she was working on,

167
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,290
the one dealing with that pollution problem.

168
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,690
Do you think I should take over that case then?

169
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,290
But unlike Ritsuko, the issue's not what I specialize in,

170
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,490
so at best, I'd probably just get both parties to settle out of court.

171
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,890
It's my phone.

172
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,090
Sorry, but you could you go on ahead to her room.

173
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,890
Sure.

174
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,690
Let's see,

175
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,490
where was her room?

176
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,790
Good grief.

177
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,290
It's Mr. Saku.

178
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,890
Hey, are you all alone, kid?

179
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,290
The police are all gone.

180
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,390
What are you doing here?

181
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,590
Ms. Kisaki said she wanted to talk to me.

182
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,690
I bet it's about that short piece of thread

183
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,090
and we found on the floor by the door

184
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,390
along with a part of the door chain.

185
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,090
I heard her talking.

186
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,390
She said that you could use that thread from the outside

187
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,190
to make it look like the door was locked.

188
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,290
That's ridiculous.

189
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,590
I can verify that the chain was fastened securely,

190
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,490
that's why I had to break the door down to get in.

191
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,290
How can you lock the door with such a short piece of thread?

192
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,390
What is the chain was cut from the very beginning?

193
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:34,690
What if the thread was holding the loose ends of the chain together?

194
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,390
And what if the knot and the parts of the chain that had been removed

195
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,590
were put on the floor in a spot that when the door was opened,

196
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,490
it would be in a blind spot.

197
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,090
Well?

198
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,390
Yes, and after that,

199
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,890
when the door is opened with force,

200
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,890
the thread will break, the chain separates

201
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,490
and all of us there will have the illusion,

202
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,190
that the door had been chained from the inside.

203
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,290
Isn't that right, Saku?

204
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
You did it, didn't you, Saku?

205
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

206
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Mr. Mouri was asleep in the room,

207
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,420
if he'd gotten up and taken the chain off,

208
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,020
the whole plan would be blown.

209
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,820
That's why you used the telephone cord to strangle her,

210
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,320
so the phone wouldn't ring

211
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,620
and you took my husband's phone away from the bedside

212
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,220
and put it near the door

213
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,520
then you put the "Do Not Disturb" sign out

214
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,220
so no one would ring the door bell, isn't that right?

215
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,620
All that so my husband wouldn't get up.

216
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,420
But then I'm sure you put his cellular near the door

217
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,820
so that we could hear it ring from the hall,

218
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,920
that way we'd know he was inside,

219
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,620
you knew that would make us get the master key to get inside.

220
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,320
If I hadn't called his phone then,

221
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,820
you would have, I'm sure of it.

222
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Nice going, Ms. Kisaki.

223
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
What you say makes sense.

224
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
But it would be wiser for you not to stand up in Mr. Mouri's defense

225
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,720
and charge me for it.

226
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,620
After all, you have no proof I did it

227
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,320
and your prefect record would be marred,

228
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,820
you wouldn't want that, would you?

229
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,220
You fool, the only reason I have a perfect record

230
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,520
is because I've had a streak of good luck.

231
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,020
It's about time it ended anyway, then at least the pressure would be off.

232
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,120
Unfortunately though, it seems my luck is still strong.

233
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
Want to know why? It's because you're confessing,

234
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,820
it started the moment you stepped inside this room.

235
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm surprised you knew this was her room.

236
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,120
Why shouldn't I?

237
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,520
There's the hayashi rice outside the door.

238
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,620
Oh my, how did you know about the hayashi rice?

239
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,320
Well...

240
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
That's right.

241
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,420
The door bell probably rang while you were still in the room

242
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
working on the door chain after killing Ritsuko.

243
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,520
When you looked through the view hole,

244
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,820
you saw the bell boy standing there,

245
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,220
and saw the memo on the desk, "Hayashi 2"

246
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,520
that's why you got so mad you tore the memo up

247
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
and threw it into the trash, right?

248
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,220
You were upset that she'd ordered room service at a time like that.

249
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,920
Then to prevent the bell boy from ringing the door bell again

250
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,620
when he returned,

251
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,920
you wrote a note inferring that the hayashi rice should be taken back

252
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
but you would pay for them,

253
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,520
then you taped the note on the sign and hung it on the door knob.

254
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,620
Unless you did those things,

255
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,220
there's no way for you to know about the hayashi rice.

256
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,020
It was just coincidence that I saw them.

257
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,620
I saw the bell boy standing in front of her room

258
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,520
holding the plates and he looked upset.

259
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,620
That's how I knew this was her room.

260
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,020
I hate to tell you this.

261
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,520
But that memo you saw meant she was to meet Mr. Hayashi at 2 o'clock.

262
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,320
You saw the memo on the desk along with the open room service menu

263
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,820
and you jumped to the conclusion that she meant hayashi rice.

264
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Did I say hayashi rice? I meant to say...

265
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,220
I knew this was her room because I looked at the room number.

266
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,420
Oh my, haven't you noticed?

267
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,820
See...

268
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,520
the door chain in this room isn't cut, is it?

269
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,720
We made a sudden request for the hotel to let us use this room,

270
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,820
her actual room is two doors down,

271
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,620
which means...

272
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,420
you had absolutely no reason to enter this room,

273
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,520
unless you were the murderer.

274
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,820
Please forgive me for setting this trap

275
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,520
but when I realized you were the killer,

276
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,220
I knew I had to be conniving or you'd never fall for it.

277
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,920
I think I understand for the first time.

278
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,620
How the prosecutors must feel going against you in court

279
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,020
but how are you going to convince the prosecution?

280
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,320
You're the only one that saw me come into this room

281
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,820
and being a part of Mr. Mouri's family,

282
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,420
your testimony wouldn't count.

283
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,220
But I'm not the only witness.

284
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,420
You're not talking about this kid, are you?

285
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
And I'm not the only one either.

286
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,020
Isn't that right, officers?

287
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
That's right, we saw everything.

288
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Right through the view hole in the room across the hall.

289
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,420
Isn't that right, men?

290
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,520
-Yes, we got a good look! -Yes, we got a good look!

291
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
-A real good look. -A real good look.

292
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,620
And we have everything on video tape too.

293
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,320
I see.

294
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,020
But it was all this little guy's idea.

295
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Now tell me, was the case she was working on your motive for killing her?

296
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,820
Yes, the village that suffered from the pollution

297
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,620
is where I grew up.

298
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,220
I really wanted them to win the case.

299
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,720
Actually, I intended to drug her in the doorway and after she was asleep,

300
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I was going to lock the room up

301
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,620
and make it look like she committed suicide

302
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,420
but Mr. Mouri was asleep in the room

303
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,720
and no one would believe she would commit suicide

304
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,120
after inviting a man into her room and then ordering room service

305
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,420
so I decided to strangle her instead and frame Mr. Mouri.

306
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,320
It would have given the judge a bad impression

307
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,420
if the villagers killed the lawyer

308
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,820
so they could win the trial, wouldn't it?

309
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,620
I intended to settle the case out of court quickly

310
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,520
then turn myself in.

311
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,320
But even if you turned yourself in,

312
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
unless there's evidence to prove you did it.

313
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,220
But I do...

314
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,320
It's that weird shaped mark left by the pliers you used

315
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,220
on the chain, isn't it?

316
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,220
There's only one pair of pliers in the world that leave that mark,

317
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,420
you were going to take that to police, weren't you?

318
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Yes.

319
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Ritsuko only took that case because it was assigned to her,

320
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,220
you didn't have to kill her.

321
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,620
I would never have done it

322
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,320
if she had taken the case to support her livelihood

323
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,120
or because she considered it her job

324
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
but when I learned she was deliberately

325
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
making things hard for the villagers and taking the case to court

326
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,320
only so she could outdo you and gain recognition,

327
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,220
well, I just couldn't let her get away with it.

328
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,320
To outdo me?

329
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,020
Yes,

330
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,020
and I think she took Mr. Mouri up to her room

331
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,620
for that very same reason.

332
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,520
I don't believe it, it can't be true.

333
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,220
As lawyers, our job is to trust our clients

334
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,020
and defend them as best as we can,

335
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,820
but you're too trusting.

336
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,420
There's a hidden side to every human being.

337
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,020
To be perfectly honest,

338
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,620
I was one of the men who was trying to get you.

339
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,020
Thank you.

340
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,620
But flattery's not going to make me take your case.

341
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,520
Oh, sorry.

342
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,020
Boy, I wished you could've seen it.

343
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Your wife's reconstruction of the crime was brilliant.

344
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,320
She's Sleeping Kogoro's wife, no doubt about it.

345
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
The Queen of the court room.

346
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,820
I got goose bumps watching her work.

347
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,920
And what were you doing while she was doing all the work?

348
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,220
I followed her instructions

349
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,920
and put the hayashi rice where it was supposed to go

350
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,820
and then I went to the room across the hall and waited as I was told.

351
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,320
When I saw them coming down the hall,

352
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,720
I called your wife on her cellular,

353
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,520
and then and then, when the suspect entered the staged room,

354
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,120
fan fare went off in my head.

355
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,220
Boy, I'm glad I became a police officer.

356
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,620
And then? So where is she now?

357
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,320
Over there, see.

358
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
At that table over there.

359
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,820
It's dad.

360
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,520
We're in luck. Now we can get some breakfast.

361
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
Hold it.

362
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,720
Don't they look friendly, this looks promising.

363
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,520
I really appreciated it, Eri.

364
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,120
I had faith in you.

365
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,320
I knew you would prove I was innocent.

366
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,620
And by the way, I'm kind of getting tired of Ran's cooking.

367
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,620
I guess I sort of miss your rather strange cuisine,

368
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,220
what I mean is...

369
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,220
would you mind coming home now.

370
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I can't take it anymore.

371
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Since today's our wedding anniversary.

372
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,920
I thought it'd be a good time to get back together...

373
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,520
Hey, did you hear me?

374
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,620
What is it?

375
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,320
Nothing.

376
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,520
Dad, mom!

377
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Quick, tell me what you were talking about?

378
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,820
I was just telling her that for a first rate lawyer,

379
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,620
she sure was working slow,

380
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,120
getting her dear husband cleared of the charges.

381
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,820
Did you say "dear" husband,

382
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,120
it should be "darn" husband, shouldn't it?

383
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,620
What did you say?

384
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,120
Well, I guess you've learned your lesson,

385
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,820
you should go easy on the liquor, you moustached, lecher!

386
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,620
-Why you, you... -Dad!

387
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,820
Ran, I nearly forgot.

388
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,920
I'm going to hang on to this disk.

389
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I got to like this song.

390
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,120
Well, I'll be seeing you.

391
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,520
Mom!

392
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Don't you ever show your face again!

393
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,420
For goodness sakes, dad, you're a fool, a fool!

394
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
"Kisaki's Office"

395
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
What I mean is...

396
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,120
would you mind coming home now.

397
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,020
I can't take it anymore.

398
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,720
Since today's our wedding anniversary.

399
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,320
I thought it'd be a good time to get back together...

400
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
What I mean is...

401
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,320
would you mind coming home now.

402
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,620
Not quite yet!

403
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,220
Saying something like this isn't going to get you off the hook.

404
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,320
Am I getting a cold?

405
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,020
I doubt it.

406
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,120
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,840
"Plastic bottle"

408
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,020
A nostalgic bonnet bus appears in the next episode.

409
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,940
Oh, that delicious meat tied up with string.

410
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,240
That's a boneless ham.
