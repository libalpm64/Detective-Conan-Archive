1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,340
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,440
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,340
Conan, Kogoro and Officer Yamamura.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,340
The briefcase is the link over time and space.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,450
A client's call to solve the mystery of the briefcase,

9
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,050
we headed to the Aoiya Inn

10
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,850
with Officer Yamamura.

11
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,950
A man wearing a red jacket was found dead

12
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,050
in the Kashiragami Forest.

13
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,150
Strangely, the man was wearing a sweater in the middle of summer.

14
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,450
Car keys and cigarettes were found on him

15
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,450
but without his driver's license or matches.

16
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,850
The briefcase in question was entrusted to the innkeeper

17
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,150
five years ago by a long-haired man wearing a red jacket.

18
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,350
But...

19
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,350
apparently someone came and take it

20
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,950
while impersonating Pops Kogoro.

21
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,950
The briefcase contained

22
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,750
five-year-old sports newspaper

23
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,550
and a bundle of hair!

24
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,750
"The Kogoro Mouri's Impostor (Part 2)"

25
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,550
Then... Does this mean...

26
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,450
Yes. This is a homicide.

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,250
And the culprit knew

28
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,850
where the "Closed for cleaning" sign is.

29
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,750
That means, the culprit is among the employees.

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,450
"Masao Jinbo (34), Yoshiro Onda (58), Eiji Urakawa (37)"

31
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,750
The culprit is probably is the person

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,150
that has something to do with the long-haired man

33
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,050
who committed suicide four years ago!

34
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,150
And probably the long-haired man

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,350
didn't commit suicide at all.

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,050
He was killed.

37
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,350
Someone had tampered the body on purpose.

38
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,150
But who? And why?

39
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,650
Officer Yamamura! I found a cell phone.

40
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,050
What?

41
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,250
It was in the jacket of the victim.

42
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,850
I found one phone number in its memory.

43
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,250
Would you like to try?

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,150
Yes. Of course!

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,550
"Redial 01"

46
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,450
Tatsuo! Is that you?

47
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,750
What happened to that gold mine of yours?

48
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,550
Let me know when you get your hands on it!

49
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,450
Oh, yes, I got a call from your landlord.

50
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,050
He says he won't extend the contract

51
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,350
and he'll have to evict you if you don't pay the rent.

52
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,550
Hey, are you listening to me?

53
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,050
-Excuse me. -Hey, got a customer!

54
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,450
Call me back later!

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,250
He hung up.

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,450
He mentioned something about a gold mine.

57
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,350
And he said that the contract can't be extended

58
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,050
unless the rent is paid.

59
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,750
Extend?

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,750
Anyway, we found that the name of the victim

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,850
is "Tatsuo Mori".

62
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,250
It's one step forward in solving the case.

63
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,050
What? How did you know his name is Tatsuo Mori?

64
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,850
Look! The phone has a name label on it!

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,450
Using a name label like a little kid. How immature!

66
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,050
Sorry for being immature!

67
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,950
I have one on mine, too!

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,050
What?

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,050
It's fine because you're still a kid!

70
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,150
What's that supposed to mean?

71
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,250
Hold on. That means the murderer is.

72
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,150
Hey, officer.

73
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,350
Can you give me more details

74
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,050
about what the long-haired man had on him?

75
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,150
What?

76
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,250
You already asked that before that.

77
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,850
He had a receipt for the milk and bun he bought four years ago!

78
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,250
Well... see.

79
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,350
Then, would you like to see the photos!

80
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,450
Photos?

81
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,250
I came to the inn today to ask about these photos.

82
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,750
This is the front and back of the crushed milk package.

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,350
The crushed bun and cigarettes

84
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,950
The convenience store receipt was found in his wallet.

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,350
The July 10 date of the receipt

86
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,150
it is the date of the tour the employees went on, right?

87
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,650
Yes.

88
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,650
Yes! That was it!

89
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,050
Now I see it! What the culprit wanted!

90
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,950
Hey, officer.

91
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,150
What?

92
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,750
By any chance, did you find a dead body

93
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,150
in the Kashiragami Forest after the employee trip

94
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,950
four years ago?

95
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,050
Yes, we found one.

96
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,650
Near the fallen Jizo statue.

97
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,950
Then by any chance was it the person who found it...

98
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,050
What?

99
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,250
How did you know?

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,550
Just as I thought. He's the killer.

101
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,350
And, the sports newspapers there

102
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,350
probably is the map where something is hidden.

103
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,350
What I need now is proof.

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,450
If my deduction is correct...

105
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,250
There must be some here.

106
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,050
Traces of the culprit on that shogi board

107
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,850
and that table.

108
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,650
I found it! That is it!

109
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,350
Hey, kid! You're not allowed to go in there!

110
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,250
I've been asked by Pops Kogoro!

111
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,150
I was told to look at the table and the board very closely.

112
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,650
What? Detective Mouri told you?

113
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,950
Yes, and I was also told to

114
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,150
take a close look at the light in this room.

115
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,450
The light?

116
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,450
He says it is the key in running down the culprit!

117
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,650
What?

118
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,050
Anyway, the estimated time of death

119
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,450
is between 4 pm and 5 pm today!

120
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,050
That time, the culprit placed the closed for cleaning sign

121
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,050
and collected long hairs in the bathroom.

122
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,350
He took it to the room.

123
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,450
And tried to divert our attention

124
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,950
by making it look like a curse of the long-haired man!

125
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,350
If only the employees of the inn know where the sign is,

126
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,450
we have just about found the culprit!

127
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,050
I want all of the employees here now!

128
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,850
We want to interview each one

129
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,250
about the early evening hours today.

130
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,350
Wait, officer.

131
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,150
Can't employees who have never seen or heard

132
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,150
about the man who died four years ago be excluded?

133
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,750
What?

134
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,650
Weren't you all here

135
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,650
when the man deposited the briefcase

136
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,350
with Mr. Onda five years ago?

137
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,550
Well... I received the case from the man in his room.

138
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,350
He was hired four years ago in spring.

139
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,950
And I just told the employees

140
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,050
that I have asked Detective Mouri

141
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,450
to come to check the case left with me five years ago.

142
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,050
I never mentioned it came from the long-haired man.

143
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,850
I see. So...

144
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,850
the connection between the briefcase and the long-haired man

145
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,350
wasn't known to everyone in this inn.

146
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,750
Hey. I am not the killer.

147
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,450
If I am the one, I won't keep it for five years.

148
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,350
I would have pried it open.

149
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,850
And isn't it puzzling?

150
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,850
Such an important case contained only old sports newspapers.

151
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,050
The culprit probably

152
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,850
took away something wrapped in newspaper

153
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,450
and has already gone far away from here.

154
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,050
Unless this newspaper has some special meaning,

155
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,350
we don't know anything.

156
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,950
You're right.

157
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,350
Hey.

158
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,650
What does "Mae-5" mean?

159
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,550
Pardon?

160
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,650
See that? I see "Mae-5" written before

161
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,950
the name of the tournament champion Akagimaru.

162
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,250
That means he ranked No. 5 among the maegashira wrestlers.

163
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,650
Since he belonged to the East Division,

164
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,050
he was East maegashira No. 5.

165
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,550
What's maegashira?

166
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,750
Does it have to do with the Kashiragami Forest?

167
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,050
What relation, dummy!

168
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,250
How about with the fallen Jizo statue?

169
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,450
Absolutely not!

170
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,250
Maegashira is...

171
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,150
A sumo wrestler ranking behind the grand champion Yokozuna

172
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,650
is champion Ozeki followed by the Sekiwake and komusubi ranks.

173
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,250
No. 5 means...

174
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,450
he ranks No. 5 among the maegashira wrestlers.

175
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,750
Okay. Then...

176
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,150
Akagimaru must have won the tournament

177
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,850
when he wasn't especially strong

178
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,150
because he was very cautious!

179
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,750
Cautious?

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,350
Because look!

181
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,050
Akagimaru fell in the hole only once!

182
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,450
What?

183
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,650
This means that the sumo wrestler fell in a hole, right?

184
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,350
It says "push-down" below that black circle.

185
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,750
That's not a hole!

186
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,450
It's a symbol for loss!

187
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,650
It means that he lost the match

188
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,650
on the eighth day of the tournament!

189
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,850
So, it doesn't mean he took eight steps and fell in a hole!

190
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,250
Anyway, I want you to call

191
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,050
all the employees for questioning.

192
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,850
Of course, we won't make any exceptions!

193
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,550
So, you don't have anyone in particular who can corroborate

194
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,950
what you were doing during those hours.

195
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,250
Yes.

196
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,650
Okay. Next, please.

197
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,250
Excuse me.

198
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,750
Will it be long?

199
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,650
I want to start cleaning up.

200
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,050
I have to prepare breakfast for tomorrow morning.

201
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,950
Can't I leave early?

202
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,650
No. That's not possible!

203
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,950
"Aoiya Inn"

204
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,850
So, I've questioned every one of you.

205
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,050
Most of you don't have alibi as to your whereabouts

206
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,050
between 4pm and 5 pm.

207
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,250
Of course! My employees work without interruption.

208
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,850
I don't have in my employ

209
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,550
anybody to monitor and clock others at work!

210
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,950
I'm impressed.

211
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,450
Officer Yamamura

212
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,150
Yes?

213
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,050
Did you see Conan and my father somewhere?

214
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,150
No.

215
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,950
Yes, Yamamura speaking.

216
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,550
Mr. Mouri?

217
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,450
Yes...

218
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,750
All right.

219
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,950
Excuse me. My father...

220
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,750
Well...

221
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,050
He went to ask neighbors around the area

222
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,150
and was taken under police custody for suspicious behavior.

223
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,850
He's at a police station.

224
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,250
What?

225
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,550
Looks like Conan is with him.

226
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,950
Anyway, I will go to pick him up at the station.

227
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,050
So, stay here and wait in this room!

228
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,050
Well...

229
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,550
How about us?

230
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,250
You can all go to sleep now.

231
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,550
We will hold a more thorough investigation

232
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,350
on a later date!

233
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,450
Bye!

234
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,810
Rocks. It can't be...

235
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,510
What...

236
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,710
I guess you've been looking for this, Mr. Jinbo.

237
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,610
No..

238
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,310
Or should I say the man

239
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,710
behind the 100-million yen blackmail case!

240
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,910
What?

241
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,510
I found as soon as we checked through

242
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,910
the serial numbers of the bills.

243
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,210
Five years ago, that the money was extorted

244
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,410
from a candy manufacturer by two men.

245
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,810
One of them being you,

246
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,610
and the other is

247
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,710
the long-haired man who had the case

248
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,710
kept by the innkeeper.

249
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,710
And the sport newspaper in the briefcase

250
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,210
pointed to the location of the money.

251
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,010
Akagimaru who made the headlines

252
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,210
was East Maegashira No. 5!

253
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,710
Maegashira,

254
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,110
literally meaning front head,

255
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,110
was the key suggesting the fallen statue in the forest.

256
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,310
Walk east five steps from the statue.

257
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,310
You take eight steps from there

258
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,710
according to Akagimaru's win or loss record.

259
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,010
If you dig the spot there,

260
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,710
you're expected to find a pot filled with money!

261
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,310
Right? Mr. Mouri?

262
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,610
Yes.

263
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,410
The reason why the long-haired man

264
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,810
put the newspaper inside the case

265
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,010
and gave it to the innkeeper for storage

266
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,810
is because he was aware

267
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,210
that you might kill him

268
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,610
to get the entire fortune.

269
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,910
Well, it was quite natural for him to notice that.

270
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,010
He probably was responsible for carrying the money.

271
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,310
And he was told meet in this forest,

272
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,610
which is a well-known suicide spot.

273
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,910
This is corroborated by the fact that

274
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,110
he included a memo in the case a message cursing you

275
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,910
just in case you would come and kill him

276
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,910
before taking the money alone

277
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,710
as a revenge.

278
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,910
Sure enough, you killed him in this forest,

279
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,910
making it look like suicide

280
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,710
and appeared in the inn with confidence

281
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,910
hiding your face with a hat, glasses and beard.

282
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,810
However, what you got was a memo cursing you to death.

283
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,310
You couldn't give up

284
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,810
and decided to investigate by working for the inn.

285
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,210
Time passed, and the body of the long-haired man was found.

286
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,810
This led to your discovery that the innkeeper

287
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,510
kept the briefcase for five years

288
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,210
and has requested me to conduct an investigation.

289
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,510
You hired the man to pose as me

290
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,310
and get the case before I do.

291
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,710
You wanted to see what's inside the case.

292
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,810
However,

293
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,610
you only found it contained an old sports newspaper.

294
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,410
The man who expected to get his share of the money got angry.

295
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,110
He threatened you saying that

296
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,210
"If you don't give me my money,"

297
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:21,510
"then I will let the real Kogoro Mouri everything!"

298
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,810
You had no choice but to kill him

299
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,310
and left the mystery for me to solve.

300
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,210
The best proof is

301
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,210
the fact that you have come here to find the money.

302
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,810
Now, let's go to the police station.

303
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,610
What are you talking about?

304
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,010
I was just inspired by the newspaper and came here.

305
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,610
I thought that I may be able to help the investigation.

306
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,510
Get off it.

307
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,610
In fact, the long-haired man died four years ago on July 10.

308
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,210
At that time, I was on the employee's trip.

309
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,010
No! That's the thing.

310
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,310
He was not killed in summer four years ago.

311
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,210
That was in fall five years ago!

312
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,410
Immediately after he deposited the briefcase at the inn!

313
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,810
You planted the milk, cigarettes, bun

314
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,510
and the convenience store receipt later!

315
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,210
You did it to mislead us

316
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,710
regarding time of death

317
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,510
and to make sure you have an alibi!

318
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,510
The milk package and receipt

319
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,410
came from another suicide case you found

320
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,510
after the employee trip four years ago!

321
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,210
That is why the long-haired man was wearing a sweater

322
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,410
and had cigarettes but not lighter or matches!

323
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,110
You removed the driver's license from him

324
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,510
because the license was soon to expire.

325
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,610
Your alibi will not work

326
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,910
if the body have a driver's license on him

327
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,710
that expired a year earlier.

328
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,210
You placed the bundle of hair in the newspaper because...

329
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,510
You wanted to direct police attention to the fact that

330
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,910
the person who killed the impostor is linked to the long-haired man.

331
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,410
And make the police think

332
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,310
you're not a suspect because of the receipt.

333
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,210
We know everything you planned!

334
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,610
Then, how did you know that the milk package and receipt

335
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,710
were placed later?

336
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,310
What?

337
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,610
The man may have actually had them with him, right?

338
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,210
Well, that's...

339
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,210
The straw!

340
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,810
The milk package did not have a straw attached to it.

341
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,110
That is proof that milk has been emptied

342
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,010
then someone refilled it in the package,

343
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,010
and sealed the lid with glue again and placed it beside the body.

344
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,810
No one puts an opened package of milk

345
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,210
inside a knapsack, right?

346
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,910
Yes... That's right!

347
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,910
Then, did you see it?

348
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,710
Did you see me kill the long-haired man?

349
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,610
Certainly, it happened too long ago to determine

350
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,110
whether you committed that murder.

351
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,310
However, we have proof that you killed the man

352
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,010
who posed as me!

353
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,010
What?

354
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,010
To carry a body and hang it from a high place,

355
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,910
the person carrying it must reach as high as the ceiling.

356
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,310
What the killer used to reach that high

357
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,310
was the shogi board and the table.

358
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,010
Of course, he had to take off his socks

359
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,310
in order not to slip.

360
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,010
I heard from the forensics that

361
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,810
there are footprints found on them.

362
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,010
What will happen

363
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,610
if we checked the prints against yours?

364
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,110
Oh, yes.

365
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,510
I did use them as a stool!

366
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,710
When I changed the light bulbs in the room.

367
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,310
I'm not lying!

368
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,410
If you check the light bulb,

369
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,310
my fingerprints should be there.

370
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:45,210
Yes, surprisingly, we found your fingerprints

371
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,010
under a thick layer of dust!

372
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,610
They probably were there for a long period of time!

373
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,310
Still, your footprints were there,

374
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,810
suggesting that you were the killer!

375
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,610
I've never heard of an inn that does not wipe desks

376
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,510
until a thick layer of dust collects on the light bulb!

377
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,210
Mr. Jinbo, let us all stop this.

378
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,610
Let's not tamper with time.

379
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,410
But...

380
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,110
But how did you know it was me?

381
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,210
You told us.

382
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,110
In the lobby, when you delivered my daughter's cell phone.

383
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,410
That time, you gave it to me without hesitation,

384
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,410
when Officer Yamamura was there,

385
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,410
someone you had never met before.

386
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,310
You told me, " Is this your daughter's?"

387
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,010
What about that?

388
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,910
I saw the name seal that said "Ran Mouri"

389
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,010
pasted on the cell phone.

390
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,110
That's why...

391
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,810
That's right. You knew me the moment you saw me.

392
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,610
That I am the real Kogoro Mouri.

393
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,010
I was really excited.

394
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,510
To see the great Sleeping Kogoro in action.

395
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,210
I can only recall up until

396
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,710
Conan tried to drag me into the forest.

397
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,910
I was astounded

398
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,310
when you phoned me instructions

399
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,710
to go to the forest for your deduction show.

400
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,910
Dad, why did the people at the inn call me Miss Echigo?

401
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,110
Never mind.

402
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,210
Hey!

403
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,910
-Excuse us. -Excuse us!

404
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,410
Is this the way to Aoiya Inn?

405
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,510
We're trying to get there

406
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,810
to see Detective Kogoro Mouri!

407
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,710
We got off the bus here but don't know how to get there.

408
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,010
Oh! You don't need to do that.

409
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,310
Here...

410
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,110
What a coincidence!

411
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,210
We were just on our way back there!

412
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
Do you want a ride?

413
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,910
Yes, of course! Is it really okay?

414
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,210
No big deal. Come on!

415
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,810
Great!

416
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,910
Thank you so much!

417
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,710
By the way, what's your name?

418
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,610
What? My name?

419
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,410
Let's say I'm just a "man of the world"

420
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,410
going by the name of Kingoro Toyama.

421
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,010
That old man never learns...

422
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,260
Next Conan Hint:

423
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,920
"Rotation"

424
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Next episode has a unique trick.

425
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,340
We need to get our arms ready for the next case.

426
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:42,420
We're going to shoot the breeze!
