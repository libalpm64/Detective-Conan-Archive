1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,890
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,790
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,690
What became of the two officers?

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,190
As the evening grows, will their love fade?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,950
We found out from Officer Yumi

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,650
that Officer Sato is going to be meeting a marriage candidate

10
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,450
who she has never met before.

11
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,850
No problem! Because it's all worked out

12
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,350
that she'll get out of there when the time is right.

13
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,350
But who's going to do that?

14
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,350
You silly thing. Who else but Officer Takagi?

15
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm going to mail him on his phone with the message,

16
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,750
"Miwako is in trouble!"

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,750
And say that a criminal case has come up

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,450
and take her away from where she is.

19
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,650
I'm sure that he'll going bursting in with a face

20
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,450
that you've never seen before.

21
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,650
You witch.

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,650
We arrived at Mizutozakura with feeling curious feelings.

23
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,050
What?

24
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,650
Shiratori? Don't tell me that he's the one from the police department?

25
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,850
Yes, he's in the Tsuru Room together with Ms. Sato.

26
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,550
Which means that the man Officer Sato is meeting is...

27
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,250
Inspector Shiratori?

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,350
Robber!

29
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,650
Someone, please catch him!

30
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,350
At that time, Officer Takagi met a robber at a convenience store.

31
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,950
He ran after a criminal and hunted him down at a restroom in the park.

32
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,150
However, there were three suspects.

33
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,950
Besides, he hasn't been able to clear which one is the criminal,

34
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,350
because everyone testified differently.

35
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,150
Just a little while longer.

36
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,050
Hello, Officer Yumi? My hands are tied just yet and...

37
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,150
Hi, this is Shinichi Kudo.

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,450
What?

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,250
Conan asked me to give you a call.

40
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,750
What did Conan ask you to do?

41
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,450
Please check your cell phone mail

42
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,050
and take note of the situation that you're in now.

43
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,550
But the only mail I got today was from Officer Yumi.

44
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,450
"Miwako is in trouble!

45
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,850
Resue her from Minatoro where she is holding a marrige meeting."

46
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,550
Officer Sato is meeting her husband to be?

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,250
So, you haven't read the mail, have you?

48
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,750
But don't worry, and please calm down.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,750
There's still a lot of time to go until sundown,

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,850
and the place she's meeting him is in the neighboring town, Haido-cho.

51
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,250
Sundown?

52
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,150
Officer Sato agreed to the terms that her proposed husband suggested.

53
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,650
If you don't solve the case by sundown and go to get her,

54
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,150
she's going to have to accept her partner's marriage proposal.

55
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,150
Please give me the details of the case.

56
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,650
Officer Takagi?

57
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,650
Officer Takagi, can you hear me?

58
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,850
Hey...

59
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,750
"Love Story At Police Headquarters 4 (Part 2)"

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,550
I have the three suspects that were in the restroom in the park

61
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,250
where the robber fled into with me.

62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,850
Of the three, two are men.

63
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,650
One of them is Mr. Hiroshi Zama, 21 years old, a part-time worker.

64
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,750
He is about 180 centimeters tall,

65
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,350
and is wearing a blue sweater and pierced earrings.

66
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,150
The other man is Yasuo Kameida, 32 years old.

67
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,550
He is a prep school teacher and about 170 centimeters tall.

68
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,750
He is wearing a green sweater and glasses.

69
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,150
The last one is a woman called Ms. Eiko Koshimizu.

70
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,050
She is 28 years old and works in an office.

71
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,150
She is about 160 centimeters tall,

72
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,050
and is wearing black clothes and wears two wristwatches.

73
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,150
When the robber broke into the convenience store,

74
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,650
the outfit the robber had on were a helmet, a coat, and gloves.

75
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,150
The robber stuck out a knife

76
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,750
and showed the employee a paper with the words, "Give me money."

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,750
The robber is still unidentified.

78
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,050
There is no doubt

79
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,550
that the robber disposed of the coat

80
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,250
and ran into the restroom in the park.

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,550
But the problem is that the testimony of the witnesses all differ.

82
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,450
The old man who bumped into the robber in front of the park says

83
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,150
the robber is a woman wearing blue clothes.

84
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,750
The girl who was watching through the window of a shop says

85
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,150
that the robber's head stuck out from among the throng of people,

86
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,950
so the robber who is about 180 centimeters tall

87
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,150
and is most likely a man.

88
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,050
And from under the coat, she saw a color green shirt.

89
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,350
As for the owner of the coffee shop,

90
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,150
he said when he was outside the shop, he saw the robber running away.

91
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,350
He says that the robber was about 170 centimeters

92
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,650
and wearing black clothes under the coat.

93
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,750
I see.

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,050
All three suspects that was testified

95
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,450
has totally different characteristics of the robber.

96
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,250
How interesting!

97
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,750
What do you mean by interesting, Kudo?

98
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,850
First of all,

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,550
go to that coffee shop and talk to Mr. Mamehara, the owner.

100
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,750
How did you know the owner's name?

101
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,950
I've known him from before.

102
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,850
Officer, what's up?

103
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,850
Did you arrest the robber?

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,250
Not yet.

105
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,350
Take the owner outside.

106
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,150
Hurry!

107
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,750
Hey!

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,650
Where are you taking me?

109
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,650
Let's talk inside the shop.

110
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,850
I'm sorry, but please come with me.

111
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,550
What's with you?

112
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,450
Your glasses are sunglasses?

113
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,250
I'm pretty sure that the sunglasses

114
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,550
that the owner's wearing have photochromic lens

115
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,250
that change color for about 15 seconds

116
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,750
when he goes outside and is exposed to ultraviolet rays.

117
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,450
From what I know, the owner doesn't wear glasses,

118
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,950
so I thought that it may be possible.

119
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,050
Well, I'm wearing these glasses just for show.

120
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,350
I decided to wear them just for fun only recently.

121
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,950
I completely forgot about them.

122
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,450
Which means that the robber's clothes that you saw

123
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,850
may have looked darker than the actual color

124
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,650
because of the change in the color of the lens of your glasses?

125
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,350
But about the robber being about 170 centimeters is a fact.

126
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,650
But...

127
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,350
another witness says that the robber was about 180 centimeters.

128
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,150
The shop that the girl said she saw the robber through the window,

129
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,050
where is it?

130
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,650
About 100 meters from this coffee shop.

131
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,350
In the direction of the convenience store.

132
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,450
Oh, it's over there.

133
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,650
Then, please go to where the shop is.

134
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,450
If I remember correctly,

135
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,550
she said she saw the head of the robber above the throng of people?

136
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,050
Yes.

137
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,250
That street

138
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,150
leads from the entrance of the subway to the bus stop,

139
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,250
so depending on the time,

140
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,150
it becomes congested with people.

141
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,850
If a throng of people come heading in your direction,

142
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,650
how would you try to make it through, Officer Takagi?

143
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,150
How?

144
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,750
I would try to avoid them as much as possible.

145
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,850
If you feel that doing so

146
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,950
will not get you through the crowd, then what will you do?

147
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,850
Well, I would have no choice

148
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,950
but to give up running along the sidewalk part way

149
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,050
and run along the curbstone...

150
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,050
I get it!

151
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,350
The girl witnessed the robber running along the curb stone,

152
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,150
and mistook the robber's height as being over 180 centimeters!

153
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,350
A puzzle.

154
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,450
It's a jigsaw puzzle, Officer Takagi.

155
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,150
Although the pieces may look scattered and mismatching,

156
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,650
if you rotate them and look at them from a different angle,

157
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,650
they will surely fit in perfectly.

158
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,350
The mismatching pieces of testimony that the witnesses

159
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,050
give us are indispensable pieces

160
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,250
that we need to complete the puzzle.

161
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,150
Conan's sure taking his time, isn't he?

162
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,750
Oh, I guess I'll go check on him.

163
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,550
I wonder if Conan ate something bad.

164
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,150
I made toast and sunny side ups for breakfast today.

165
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,550
And for lunch...

166
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm pretty sure I've seen

167
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,450
that person once before...

168
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,350
Oh, my. So it wasn't the right person after all?

169
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,550
I've seen that person somewhere before.

170
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,450
The only person left is the old man who says he ran into the robber.

171
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,650
According to my deduction,

172
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,350
the testimony of that old man is the most decisive.

173
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,750
Hey, Kudo.

174
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,950
Yes?

175
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,150
Why?

176
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,450
How did you know so much?

177
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,850
-Well, that's... -Conan?

178
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,750
Oh, no! It's Ran!

179
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,050
Conan, are you all right?

180
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,850
Oh, so will you please talk to that old man once more?

181
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,750
Then, you'll be able to narrow the robber down to just one person!

182
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,750
Hold on.

183
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,450
If I remember correctly the old man testified

184
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,450
that the robber was a woman wearing blue clothes under her coat.

185
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,750
But Mr. Zama is the one who is the one wearing blue clothes.

186
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,050
Oh, yes. It's his pierced earrings!

187
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,050
The old man saw the earrings and thought it was a woman...

188
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,050
Oh, wait. When they bumped into each other the robber

189
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,750
should still have been wearing the helmet.

190
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,450
He couldn't have seen the robber's face.

191
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,050
Then, why did he think the robber was a woman?

192
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,350
Darn it.

193
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,750
40 minutes left to sundown.

194
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,050
I've got to hurry or else Officer Sato will have to...

195
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,950
Watch...

196
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,050
Come to think of it, that person...

197
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,350
I see! That's what it was!

198
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,050
I've got it!

199
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,750
I've figured out who the robber is!

200
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,110
The sun has set quite a bit.

201
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,210
Oh, I guess so.

202
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,010
Officer Sato.

203
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,910
It's not that I don't trust you,

204
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,610
but if Officer Takagi fails to make it here in time,

205
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,210
I'd like some proof of it.

206
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,610
Proof?

207
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,910
As proof of it,

208
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,910
I'd like you to give me a kiss as a pledge of your promise.

209
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,910
He said a kiss.

210
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,710
A kiss of pledge?

211
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,010
Me and you?

212
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,910
Yes.

213
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,710
You don't mind, do you?

214
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,510
Because if Officer Takagi doesn't come here by sundown,

215
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,010
we're going to get married anyway.

216
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,310
You promised not to go back on your word, didn't you?

217
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,210
Yes, of course.

218
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,510
Come on. What's keeping you, Officer Takagi?

219
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,910
Hurry up and arrest the robber, will you?

220
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,210
Oh, Officer Takagi.

221
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,210
Did you find out anything new?

222
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,010
No, not at all.

223
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,410
The testimonies of the witnesses

224
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,110
are still all different as far as the robber is concerned.

225
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,710
A woman wearing a blue dress,

226
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,310
a man wearing green clothes that is more than 180 centimeters tall

227
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,010
or a person wearing black clothes that is about 170 centimeters.

228
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,410
That's no help...

229
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,110
We can't possibly narrow down the suspect to one person

230
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,410
with what we've got now.

231
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,810
I guess I'll take my time.

232
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,110
Because after all, it's still before 3 pm.

233
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,510
So, I've still got lots of time.

234
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,210
Hey, just what are you talking about?

235
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,810
Your watch must be broken.

236
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,310
It's already 4:30 pm.

237
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,610
Huh?

238
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,510
So, it was you after all, wasn't it?

239
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,510
Huh?

240
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,810
Officer Takagi.

241
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,610
The owner shop said that the robber was wearing black clothes

242
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,210
because he had glasses with photochromic lens on.

243
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,610
And the girl said the robber was more than 180 meters tall

244
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,310
because the robber in order to avoid the crowd,

245
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,810
he ran along the curbstone.

246
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,010
Aside from the testimonies black clothes

247
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,010
and more than 180 centimeters,

248
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,010
when matching the testimonies of the two,

249
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,410
the robber is said to have been about 170 centimeters

250
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,210
and wearing green clothes.

251
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,910
In other words, Mr. Kamieda...

252
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,410
you're the one who did it.

253
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,210
But the old man who bumped into the robber said that

254
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,310
the robber was a woman wearing blue clothes.

255
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,410
Yes.

256
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,610
But at that time,

257
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,410
it had completely slipped my mind that the witness

258
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,210
was an elderly man.

259
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,410
Take a look.

260
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,510
What a beautiful sunset.

261
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,210
20 more minutes to go untill the sun completely sets.

262
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,610
Officer Takagi.

263
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,610
Officer Takagi.

264
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,810
Officer Takagi!

265
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,410
I get it, the old man!

266
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,110
Elderly men in Japan sometimes say blue

267
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,210
when they actually mean the color green!

268
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,310
Yes.

269
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,310
Elderly people in Japan

270
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,610
used to say blue regardless of

271
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,210
whether they meant indigo, light blue or green.

272
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,510
After recalling that Mr. Kamieda was a prep school teacher,

273
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,110
an idea raced through my mind.

274
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,110
He mentioned that

275
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,110
he tried to devise ways of not making the students worry

276
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,810
about the passage of time during his classes.

277
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,610
So, I figured that it could be that he had the face

278
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,510
of his wristwatch turned towards the inner part of his wrist

279
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,510
where only he himself could see what time it was.

280
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,810
I see.

281
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,010
So the old man

282
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,010
mistook the robber as being a woman

283
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,010
because the face of the robber's wristwatch was on the inner side

284
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,210
of the wrist than the outer.

285
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,410
Yes.

286
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,510
He probably always used to wear his wristwatch in this fashion

287
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,010
because it was too much trouble

288
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,410
to keep changing the position of his wristwatch for every class.

289
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,410
In other words,

290
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,210
the testimony of the witnesses all point to the fact

291
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,710
that you are the one who robbed the convenience store,

292
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,710
Mr. Kamieda!

293
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,110
A little less than 10 minutes to go.

294
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,410
I guess I've won the bet.

295
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,410
Please don't wear such a dreadful look.

296
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,610
I'm not going to force you to marry me right away,

297
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,710
at least not until you're perfectly ready to accept me.

298
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,910
I'm willing to wait as long as you want me to.

299
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,310
Huh?

300
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,510
I don't want to make an enemy out of you.

301
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,210
I'm always on your side.

302
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,910
Inspector Shiratori...

303
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,210
The phone...

304
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,710
Oh, Officer Sato?

305
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,010
Takagi here!

306
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,710
I just arrested the convenience store robber.

307
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,210
The place you're at is pretty near from here,

308
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,110
so I'll be over in about five minutes.

309
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,810
Just hurry up and come get me then, will you?

310
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,510
Good grief.

311
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,810
May I ask you a question before I head on there?

312
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,410
What?

313
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,310
Why me?

314
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,010
-Huh? -Why did you believe in a person like me...

315
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,110
and agree to bet on something so important

316
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,810
that would affect your whole life?

317
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,210
Because I was positive that you would come get me!

318
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,510
Does it bug you?

319
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,410
Oh, well...

320
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,510
You see, that's...

321
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,810
Maybe...

322
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,410
You...

323
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,010
Well, you...

324
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,910
I thought that you like...

325
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,010
The robber got away!

326
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,210
Hey, freeze!

327
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,810
Come on, Officer Takagi!

328
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,010
Oh, but...

329
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,510
I don't have time left!

330
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,910
Officer Takagi.

331
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:07,110
Which means more to you, the convenience store robber or me?

332
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,310
Huh?

333
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,010
Go after him, Officer Takagi!

334
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,310
Yes!

335
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,910
Are you sure it's okay?

336
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,110
If he goes after the robber now, there's no way he'll make it in time.

337
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,110
Well, if so,

338
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,110
I guess I'll have to resign to the fact that

339
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,810
it was destined to turn out this way.

340
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,110
It could be that the heavens punished me

341
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,410
for getting Officer Takagi involved in this bet without his permission.

342
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,110
But a bet's a bet!

343
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,610
Shall we get started...

344
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,110
with that pledge or whatever it is?

345
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,710
4:56 pm, suspect arrested.

346
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,410
I wanted money.

347
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,410
I needed severance money

348
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,210
to give to a woman who persistently hung around me.

349
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,310
Goodness.

350
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,910
I've come quite a distance

351
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,110
from Minatorou.

352
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,110
I would never be able to make it there now.

353
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,410
Officer Takagi!

354
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,810
You did it, Officer Takagi.

355
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,810
No, I goofed and let go of

356
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,510
who I really wanted to catch the most.

357
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,210
Hey, so what's the matter?

358
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,310
Hurry up and get on with it.

359
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,310
I'm all ready and set!

360
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,410
Ready and set?

361
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,210
But your face says you don't want to.

362
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,710
Don't worry, Miwako.

363
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,410
Let's just stay this way for a while and calm down a bit.

364
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,910
After all, there is nothing to keep us apart anymore anyway.

365
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,510
They're finally going to kiss.

366
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,210
I'll go stop them!

367
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,810
What are you talking about?

368
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,910
Dr. Araide, can you please come here?

369
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,810
I'll take him to the station,

370
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,710
so you go on ahead, Officer Takagi.

371
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,110
You're an officer, aren't you?

372
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,310
If so, then do what an officer

373
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,910
is expected to do and pursue your target until the end!

374
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,910
Takagi!

375
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,410
Okay.

376
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,310
The sun will completely set soon.

377
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,610
Have you calmed down?

378
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,710
Yes.

379
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,010
What is it, Conan?

380
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,610
You know...

381
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,510
I never realized

382
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,410
that he had...

383
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,310
come to mean so much to me.

384
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,210
Hey...

385
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,610
Hold it!

386
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,210
I'm really a crummy officer

387
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,410
for realizing something like this only now.

388
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,910
I guess this is just what I need to forget the whole deal.

389
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,110
Goodbye, Officer Takagi.

390
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,110
Assistant Inspector Miwako Sato!

391
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,110
I'm sorry to bother you when you're off duty,

392
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,210
but we've got a case

393
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,310
and I hope you'll come to back us up?

394
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,210
Officer Takagi?

395
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,210
He's come! Officer Takagi!

396
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,810
Bad timing!

397
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,010
Officer Takagi!

398
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,610
Officer Takagi?

399
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,910
Conan?

400
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,010
Officer Takagi...

401
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:10,510
Officer Takagi just went running down the corridor to the entrance.

402
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,710
Good grief.

403
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,910
Oh, Miwako.

404
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,610
Miss?

405
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,010
No good.

406
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,410
The sun has completely set.

407
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,310
I couldn't make it in time.

408
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,410
Police Sergeant Takagi!

409
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,610
Huh?

410
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,610
What the hell are you doing?

411
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,610
Hurry up, get in!

412
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,910
Officer Sato.

413
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,810
You've got a case on your hands, haven't you?

414
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh, yes.

415
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,610
I couldn't help but wanting to help out.

416
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,210
I mean those two are so awkward at things like this

417
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,210
just like some other two whom I'm really familiar with.

418
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,410
Sire...

419
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,210
I feel real bad for doing this to Inspector Shiratori, though.

420
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,260
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,460
"Autumn leaves"
