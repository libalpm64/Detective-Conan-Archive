1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,739
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,539
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,339
Care is the key to the dying message.

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,039
Officer Takagi is on stage.

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,839
Solve the case with smile and peace.

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,239
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,939
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:19,339
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:09,023
Hello. Are you sleeping?

10
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,023
You're gonna catch cold.

11
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:18,423
Okay! I gotta call the ambulance!

12
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:23,523
I found a man lying on the ground!

13
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:26,723
He's bleeding from this head!

14
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:28,923
Oh, the place?

15
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:30,823
I think...

16
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:34,123
What's taking them so long?

17
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:37,423
Why can't they just come right away?

18
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,923
The hospital is right in front of the train station.

19
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:44,923
Since they are not coming, I should go and get them!

20
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:58,623
"The Man Who Called the Ambulance"

21
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:01,023
Yeah, that's what I mean.

22
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,723
The guy who found the victim

23
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:06,523
disappeared from the site of murder.

24
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,823
The first person to find the victim disappeared?

25
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:13,523
I told you! He ran away right after he called 911.

26
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:15,423
What's the matter?

27
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:19,523
Is it actually me that you are talking about?

28
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:23,223
So you are the one who found the victim first? Where were you hiding?

29
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:26,923
"Hiroshi Hiromatsu (28), Comedian" -I wasn't hiding or anything.

30
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:29,823
I left here to get the ambulance!

31
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:31,723
Did you really?

32
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,623
I don't think you needed to

33
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:37,123
because the victim was already dead long ago.

34
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:39,723
That's right.

35
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:43,023
It seems he died immediately after being clubbed in his head.

36
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,823
So I appreciate that you came here all the way but...

37
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,023
I got it!

38
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:52,323
You left here to get the ambulance which in fact was unnecessary.

39
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:54,023
It's strange, isn't it?

40
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,223
Name!

41
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:58,723
What are you talking about? How could I know that he was dead?

42
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:00,123
Name!

43
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,523
What's your name?

44
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:04,723
Oh, it's Hiroshi Hiromatsu.

45
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:09,223
What an arrogant police officer we got.

46
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:12,523
Come on! Your name, address, age, job!

47
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,023
Write everything down on this!

48
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,323
"Hiroshi Hiromatsu"

49
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,623
It's Hiroshi Hiromatsu no matter which way you read it.

50
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:22,323
Your name is like a tongue twister.

51
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:26,223
What can I do? It's my name!

52
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:29,223
You're a comedian, huh?

53
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:30,723
I've never heard of your name before.

54
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:33,523
Well, I'm not a popular one, really.

55
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,923
If this random man was the first to find the victim...

56
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,623
The victim...

57
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,823
I've never seen something like this before.

58
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:42,023
Peace.

59
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:45,423
What? The smiling and peace?

60
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,823
What does it mean?

61
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:48,923
Are you done?

62
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,823
-Yes. -Let's see.

63
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,323
What is it?

64
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:59,223
Hey, Iwai and Hirano!

65
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,223
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

66
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:05,223
Find out as much as you can about this guy for me.

67
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:07,923
-You got it? -Yes, sir!

68
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:11,423
Sir, did I write something wrong?

69
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:19,723
It's Officer Takagi.

70
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,923
I'm Takagi from the metropolitan police.

71
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,623
Mr. Takagi!

72
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,823
Hiromatsu?

73
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,423
I'm Sakurada from Beika East Station.

74
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:30,723
Do you know him?

75
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:34,623
Yes, he actually helped me catch shoplifters before.

76
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,823
So, why are you here?

77
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:40,423
It happened to be me, who found the victim first.

78
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,823
You are the first one?

79
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:44,323
Well, maybe there was something else he did as well.

80
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,823
What do you mean by that?

81
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:50,023
He is suspicious about Mr. Hiromatsu.

82
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:51,523
Conan!

83
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:54,123
So, what is it, Mr. Sakurada?

84
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:57,123
You think Hiromatsu is the murderer?

85
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,223
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

86
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:01,223
It's the basics of investigation.

87
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:03,823
But I did not kill the victim.

88
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:07,823
Look, I know what kind of person he is. This can't be him.

89
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:11,223
The reason I think he is the murderer is...

90
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,523
I got a phone call from the police.

91
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:19,023
I'm Yukiko Yasunaga, the owner of Office Yasunaga.

92
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,323
I'm Sakurada of Beika East Station.

93
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:24,523
-And you? -You're Mr. Ryoji Mizuhara, right?

94
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:26,523
I've seen you a lot on TV drama and stuff.

95
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,523
Oh yeah! You're the actor!

96
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,323
I'm Mizuhara.

97
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:35,223
Ohkubo was the manager of Mizuhara.

98
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:36,623
Ohkubo?

99
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:39,623
Mr. Iwao Ohkubo, the victim.

100
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:42,823
I need you to identify the victim.

101
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:46,623
What the heck is this?

102
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:47,823
Smile?

103
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,623
A peace sign?

104
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,023
Is it him?

105
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,323
Yes, it is him.

106
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,823
He was my manager, Mr. Ohkubo.

107
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:58,223
Hiromatsu, what are you doing here?

108
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,923
It's a long story.

109
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:02,723
Do you guys know each other?

110
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,623
We're living in the same apartment, right next to each other.

111
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:08,523
I see, I understand.

112
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:10,723
Last time we talked,

113
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:14,223
you said Mr. Ohkubo was working late last night.

114
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:17,223
He was actually in my room just a while ago.

115
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:19,923
It was late last night when he came to my place.

116
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,823
We were talking about my future plan as an actor.

117
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,723
It went on until midnight.

118
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:31,523
Then, to catch the first train,

119
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:33,923
he left my place around 4.30am in the morning.

120
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:39,523
So, he left your apartment and headed to the station

121
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:41,723
and this was the street that he took.

122
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:48,823
4.40am.

123
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:52,623
It was 10 minutes after he left Mr. Mizuhara's apartment.

124
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:54,623
I assume the murder weapon was a steel pipe

125
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,423
although we haven't found it yet.

126
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:00,923
Okay then, after 20 minutes, which was 5am,

127
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,323
you found the victim on the street while you were jogging.

128
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:04,823
That's right.

129
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:08,523
You guys are living on 4th street.

130
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:10,323
The train station is this way.

131
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,223
And the hospital is located before the station.

132
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:16,323
So it'll be like this though it's a rough sketch.

133
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:19,923
Mr. Takagi, since I was interrupted last time,

134
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:21,523
now it's a good time to tell you

135
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,123
the reason why I suspect Mr. Hiromatsu.

136
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,423
He killed Ohkubo?

137
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,523
Did you?

138
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:30,523
No, I didn't!

139
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,623
First of all, you were the first one to find the victim!

140
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,823
There's a possibility that the murderer

141
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:39,223
left his belongings in the site of the murder.

142
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:42,023
But if he pretends that he is the first person to find the victim,

143
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,523
then he can make an excuse,

144
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:47,523
saying that these things were there when he found the victim!

145
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:48,923
Yeah, but...

146
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:53,223
Second of all, you left the murder scene to get the ambulance.

147
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:55,523
You know, people usually don't do that.

148
00:08:55,523 --> 00:09:01,823
Perhaps you left for some other purpose, didn't you?

149
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,323
What's that supposed to mean?

150
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:04,823
For example...

151
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:08,723
This is Sakurada.

152
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,423
The murder weapon was found?

153
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,523
Yes, I'm pretty sure, sir.

154
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:15,923
It's got some hair on it

155
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:19,523
as well as bloodstains which are still wet.

156
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,623
Yes. We found it under...

157
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:24,223
Kamitakada Bridge. Just as I thought.

158
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,323
Good job!

159
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,423
Kamitakada Bridge?

160
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:32,823
That's a bridge located between this murder site and the hospital.

161
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:36,223
So, the reason why you headed to the hospital was...

162
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:39,323
Not to call the ambulance...

163
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,523
but to dispose of the murder weapon.

164
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:49,323
Give me a break! Why would I have to kill him in the first place?

165
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,623
As to that, I already have a clue!

166
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:52,923
What?

167
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:56,823
You said you are a comedian but not popular at all.

168
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:59,323
You knew that Mr. Ohkubo was Mr. Mizuhara's manager

169
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:03,023
and you knew that he visited Mr. Mizuhara often,

170
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:06,523
so you begged Mr. Ohkubo to give you a job.

171
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,323
Yet, he refused.

172
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,923
You got mad, and then...

173
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,123
Hold on.

174
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:15,323
And you know what? The dying message the victim left

175
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,523
is telling that you are the murderer!

176
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:19,423
Dying message?

177
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,023
What is it?

178
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:24,323
It's how Mr. Ohkubo died. Wasn't it strange?

179
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,023
Smiling with a peace sign.

180
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,823
That was the dying message?

181
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,523
Exactly, that was the murderer's name!

182
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,523
Here. Take a look!

183
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:40,923
"Comedian. Stage name: Smiley Peace"

184
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,823
Smiley Peace.

185
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:47,423
I knew you were a comedian

186
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,423
but I didn't know that your stage name was this.

187
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:51,323
Yeah, but I didn't kill him!

188
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,023
Believe me, Mr. Takagi!

189
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:55,823
Hey, what about his alibi?

190
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,023
Oh, alibi?

191
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,223
If Mr. Ohkubo was killed at 4.40am,

192
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,423
then I was still in my apartment.

193
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,923
I left there a little before 5am.

194
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:08,223
It was right after I started jogging when I found the victim!

195
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:11,523
I wish you could prove that.

196
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:15,023
Yeah, but how can you prove that a man living alone

197
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,923
was in his room?

198
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:20,723
Oh, I remember, after Mr. Ohkubo left,

199
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:24,023
I set the alarm clock and went to bed.

200
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:27,723
Then I heard the sound of the toilet flushing

201
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,723
from the room next to mine.

202
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,823
And that was 4.40am, right, Mr. Mizuhara?

203
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:34,023
I think so.

204
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,923
Now you have an alibi, Hiromatsu!

205
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:37,923
Yeah!

206
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,823
What's that look on his face?

207
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,823
Sorry. May I go home now?

208
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:49,123
Ohkubo was like a father to you. You must be shocked.

209
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,323
I think you're done with Mizuhara, right?

210
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:57,023
Well, I will have to see you some other time, but today, yes.

211
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:02,323
May I go home too?

212
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,923
I haven't asked you about the situation

213
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:07,423
when you found the dead victim, have I?

214
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,523
You're right.

215
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:16,023
Are you sure?

216
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:19,123
Got it! Thanks.

217
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:23,923
Bad news. The alibi you stated is invalid.

218
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,823
I knew you were hiding something,

219
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,823
so I had my officers investigate this area,

220
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:33,823
searching for some kind of clue.

221
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,523
And guess who was on the security camera

222
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,923
in the convenient store on 3rd street? You.

223
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:42,823
And the time was 4.30am.

224
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:45,723
I'm sorry!

225
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,723
I lied.

226
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:51,523
I left my apartment to jog before 4.30am!

227
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:53,123
Hiromatsu.

228
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:57,123
But, if I told you the truth, I'd become the main suspect!

229
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,223
So that was a lie out of desperation, huh?

230
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:02,223
That's why you had a strange look on your face.

231
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,723
Maybe that was Mr. Mizuhara's imagination?

232
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:09,023
I don't know. But that was totally out of blue that he said so.

233
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:11,323
So it was just a coincidence that you lied about your alibi

234
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,623
and Mr. Mizuhara backed you up out of mistaken imagination.

235
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,823
Is that what it is?

236
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:20,023
Well, there's no need to lie if you're truly innocent.

237
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:23,523
Now, I need you to come to the station, Mr. Hiromatsu.

238
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:26,123
Oh sorry, it's Mr. Smiley Peace!

239
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,323
Mr. Takagi.

240
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:35,023
The motive of the murder and the disposal of the weapon

241
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,123
are all Mr. Sakurada's idea.

242
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:41,523
The dying message is the problem, right?

243
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:45,323
Smiley Peace, I didn't know it was him.

244
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:48,423
I'm surprised that Mr. Ohkubo knew that name.

245
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:50,823
I didn't even know that was a stage name.

246
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:54,323
Mr. Mizuhara knew the name only because they were neighbors, right?

247
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:57,023
I haven't seen Mr. Mizuhara on TV lately,

248
00:13:57,023 --> 00:14:00,123
But he used to be on a lot of TV shows.

249
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:04,223
With a never smile but handsome face. He was cool.

250
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:08,623
I'm worried about Hiromatsu,

251
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:11,623
so I'll go and watch the interrogation.

252
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,523
Smiley Peace.

253
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,323
Smile with a peace sign.

254
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,623
Smile...

255
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,423
Maybe...

256
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:24,823
You're...

257
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,023
I'm Conan Edogawa.

258
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:29,423
All right, Conan, what's up?

259
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:33,123
Officer Takagi told me to ask you something.

260
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,023
It's about the conversation

261
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:38,023
Mr. Ohkubo had with Mr. Mizuhara last night.

262
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:41,423
You mean the future plan about Mizuhara's career.

263
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:45,323
Yes, Officer Takagi wants to know more about this future plan in detail.

264
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:50,123
Okay, so this future plan means...

265
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,423
Just as I thought!

266
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:57,623
Now I know what the dying message means!

267
00:14:58,223 --> 00:14:59,523
And...

268
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:03,323
the real murderer is that person!

269
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,443
Ms. Yasunaga?

270
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,843
You mean the female owner of the production company?

271
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,943
Yeah. She told me to tell you this

272
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,943
because she thought it might help to solve the case.

273
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,343
What?

274
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:22,043
The future plan means "smile".

275
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,643
Smile?

276
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:28,443
Ryoji Mizuhara was a cool handsome actor that never smiles.

277
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:29,943
That's how we sold him.

278
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:32,943
But that style doesn't work any more.

279
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:35,143
So, Ohkubo decided to tell him about

280
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,643
switching to a handsome actor with warm smiles.

281
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:40,243
That's why he visited me last night.

282
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,543
I agreed with that plan,

283
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,543
because Mizuhara looks so sexy when he smiles.

284
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,743
Switching to a smiley actor.

285
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,243
Yeah!

286
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,443
But I'm pretty sure that Mr. Mizuhara was surprised

287
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,643
since he was told so out of the blue.

288
00:15:56,643 --> 00:16:00,443
He was more angry than surprised,

289
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:03,143
I think it's because he was suddenly told to be an actor

290
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:05,543
that was totally opposite what he used be, right?

291
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,543
Oh no!

292
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,643
Also, Mr. Ohkubo

293
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:13,643
treated Mr. Mizuhara as if he were his own child, I heard.

294
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:17,143
Ohkubo had a sickness actually.

295
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,343
What?

296
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:21,443
The doctor told him that he had only six months more to live.

297
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:24,243
So he should've been resting in the hospital,

298
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:26,343
but he refused, and worked hard instead,

299
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:29,943
just to make his boy Mizuhara make a great comeback on TV once again,

300
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:32,543
while sacrificing his life.

301
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,543
He did it all for Mizuhara.

302
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,643
Sacrificed his life...

303
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:43,043
Then, I think I got the meaning of the dying message!

304
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,643
Really?

305
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:47,343
Yeah. If my deduction is correct,

306
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:49,843
then this case is a really sad one.

307
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,843
Right. This is not a funny case at all.

308
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:01,243
What is this? Why are you calling everyone to the murder scene?

309
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:06,843
Listen, Mr. Sakurada, Hiromatsu did not murder Mr. Ohkubo.

310
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,143
The murderer is somebody else.

311
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:10,643
First of all, about the disposal of the murder weapon.

312
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:14,643
After the murder, the killer fled from here as you can imagine.

313
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:17,043
But which way did the killer run away?

314
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:21,843
Kamitakada Bridge, where the weapon was found, is that way.

315
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:25,443
Then, the murderer ran that way too?

316
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,243
Not necessarily.

317
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:30,243
Maybe he went that way!

318
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:32,543
Criminals usually try to divert police attention

319
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:35,243
opposite the direction that they flee.

320
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:37,643
Very simple trick though.

321
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:41,943
I see. The real murderer is someone that's living around here.

322
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,243
Wait a second.

323
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:47,243
Mr. Mizuhara, your apartment is this way, isn't it?

324
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,643
Yeah.

325
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,343
Second of all, about establishing the alibi.

326
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:55,343
Perhaps this criminal act was a compulsive one.

327
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,743
Thus the murderer was not well-prepared, I assume.

328
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:01,943
But that person came up with a good idea.

329
00:18:01,943 --> 00:18:05,843
You lied about your alibi out of desperation, right?

330
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:09,243
The true murderer tried to use that lie.

331
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,943
I don't get it.

332
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:12,243
Don't you remember?

333
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:15,343
There was one person who was drawn into your lie.

334
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:20,543
Yes. Ryoji Mizuhara!

335
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,443
You murdered Mr. Ohkubo.

336
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:27,543
Then I heard the sound of the toilet flushing

337
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:29,143
from the room next to mine.

338
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:32,543
That was neither your imagination nor misconception, right?

339
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:36,343
By saying so, you tried to fabricate your alibi

340
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:39,243
that you were in your room at that time.

341
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,943
Last night, Mr. Ohkubo

342
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:44,943
made a suggestion about the future plan of your career.

343
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:48,143
He told you that you needed to show your smile.

344
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:51,443
But, you had always been a cool, handsome actor that didn't smile,

345
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:54,343
and you did not want to lose this image.

346
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,743
So, Mr. Ohkubo's suggestion was not one of your options.

347
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:00,443
And then you thought Mr. Ohkubo was gonna force you

348
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:04,143
to change your character even if you didn't want to. No way!

349
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,743
Did it go something like this?

350
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:09,643
I'm Ryoji Mizuhara.

351
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,643
Do you think I am gonna laugh like a teenage brat?

352
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,943
Mizuhara, you murdered Mr. Ohkubo?

353
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:19,043
This morning, after he left your apartment,

354
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,943
you followed Mr. Ohkubo.

355
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:35,843
You are right, Officer Takagi.

356
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,243
But then why did the victim die in such a strange way?

357
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,643
How would you explain that?

358
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:45,943
Of course, as you thought, that was a dying message.

359
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:48,143
But it wasn't "Smiley Peace".

360
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,443
It was "smile" and "Victory sign".

361
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:53,543
It was Mr. Ohkubo's last message to you,

362
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:56,943
whom he treated like his own child.

363
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,843
Mr. Ohkubo said to you,

364
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:05,343
Mizuhara, smile. Smile is your new style.

365
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:07,943
You look amazing when you smile.

366
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,443
I didn't know that.

367
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:15,643
This can't be true!

368
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,443
Who in the world would encourage someone

369
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,543
that's actually trying to kill you?

370
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,143
But there are people like that.

371
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,743
That's how much Ohkubo cared about Mizuhara.

372
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:28,643
He deeply cared about you, didn't you know, Mizuhara?

373
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:32,143
He had only six months left to live.

374
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:36,143
But he decided to sacrifice his valuable time for you.

375
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,143
Mr. Ohkubo!

376
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,243
Mr. Ohkubo was thinking about you

377
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:49,243
until the last moment of his life.

378
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:53,143
You should pay for your crime and live right for him, Mr. Mizuhara.

379
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:55,943
All right.

380
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:59,743
Let me hear your story in the station, okay?

381
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:02,943
Mr. Sakurada!

382
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,243
Huh?

383
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,743
Could you...

384
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:08,143
please apologize to Hiromatsu?

385
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:13,543
Please apologize that you suspected Hiromatsu!

386
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:16,643
Yes, he did lie about his alibi.

387
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,843
And lying is not a good thing.

388
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,743
But it's partly your fault

389
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:23,043
because you put too much pressure on him

390
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:24,443
so that he had to lie!

391
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:27,043
Am I wrong, Mr. Sakurada?

392
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:29,143
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

393
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,443
It is the basics of investigation.

394
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:36,343
But there's a flaw that people tend to ignore in this principle too.

395
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:39,443
This applies not only to you, but me as well.

396
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:43,843
That is, police officers must be free from prejudice!

397
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,243
No matter what!

398
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:48,843
I understand.

399
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:50,743
I apologize.

400
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,443
No, it's okay.

401
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:53,543
Bye.

402
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:59,543
Thank you so much, Mr. Takagi!

403
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:01,243
Now you are free.

404
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:05,143
You're a man, Officer Takagi.

405
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,143
Well, I thought my life was over

406
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:36,743
when I heard that the name of the murderer

407
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:39,443
was Smiling with a victory sign, seriously.

408
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:43,243
You should've even thought about it in the first place.

409
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:46,643
Yeah, I don't think Mr. Ohkubo knew

410
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:50,343
a comedian called "Smiley Peace" anyway.

411
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:53,043
People of the same industry don't know my name.

412
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,843
That shows how unpopular I am, doesn't it?

413
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:58,943
Continue to try your best, Hiromatsu.

414
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,670
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,970
"Secret of tricks"

416
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,970
Officer Takagi, can you do some tricks?

417
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,570
It's transformation. Look, 3, 2, 1.

418
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,074
-Grilled eel! -We're not talking about food, Genta.
