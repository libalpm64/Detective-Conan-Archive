1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,770
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,570
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,170
A surprising island secret.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,370
The battle of deduction ends in a twist.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,570
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,910
A television program pitting the best detectives from the East and West

9
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,410
brings us along with Heiji Hattori here to Okinawa.

10
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,610
We accompany the filming crew to an uninhabited island

11
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,610
where an unidentified body and a mysterious message is found,

12
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,510
Then a female member of the film crew, Yoshie Taira,

13
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,610
is murdered and a mysterious message is found near her body

14
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,510
"I'm the 'guso' messenger." (I Death's messenger)

15
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,310
then the boat we came on

16
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,010
and the captain disappeared.

17
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,610
Having no other choice, we wait for someone to come to rescue us

18
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,610
at the village head's villa that is on the island.

19
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,910
What was that?

20
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,810
Maybe it's...

21
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,210
Yes, I knew it! It's the rescue boat!

22
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,910
We're saved!

23
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,110
Something's wrong with that boat.

24
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,310
Yeah, there're no lights on

25
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,410
and it's not docked right.

26
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,910
"I'm the 'guso's messenger'." (I Death's messenger)

27
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,910
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 3)"

28
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,310
Hey. It's already 5 in the morning.

29
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,610
No wonder I'm starved.

30
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,310
I haven't eaten a thing for half a day.

31
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,710
Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.

32
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,810
Shall we go get something for you from the kitchen?

33
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,910
There may be non-perishable food or canned juice.

34
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,410
I guess so.

35
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,410
Are they going to be okay, just those two girls?

36
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,010
They'll be fine.

37
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,410
I hear they're pretty strong.

38
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,710
There we go!

39
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,410
Rice crackers and fried dough cookies!

40
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,610
But won't eating things like that make you even more thirsty?

41
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,510
But, it's better than not having anything to eat, isn't it?

42
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,110
What was that sound?

43
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,410
I don't know.

44
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,510
It sounded like water dripping.

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,510
Oh, no. It's coming this way.

46
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,510
You don't think it's...

47
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,510
The death's messenger?

48
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,010
What're you two doing?

49
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,410
What're you two holding knives with your mouth like that?

50
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,110
Heiji.

51
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,410
We thought you were the death's messenger.

52
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,810
You know, the one that Mr. Daito was telling us about.

53
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,510
If you don't want it to suck your soul out hold a knife in your mouth.

54
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,310
But what's with you, Heiji?

55
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,010
How come you're all wet?

56
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,610
Oh, you mean this?

57
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,210
Heiji dove into the ocean after that.

58
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,310
Because he thought that if the killer threw our things away at the wharf,

59
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,110
his bag with his cell phone inside it

60
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,710
would be stuck on some coral around the area.

61
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,910
And did you find your bag?

62
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,410
No. It seems to have drifted into the sea.

63
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,910
It's written "Kachan".

64
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,710
While this one here is written "Chiyoni".

65
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,210
Hey, maybe "Kachan" refers to the maid, Kako Matsumoto.

66
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,510
I see.

67
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,710
"KA" is taken from her first name.

68
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,910
If she's a maid, it's only natural

69
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,310
that she'd spend most of her time in the kitchen.

70
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,710
Then, what about this "chiyoni"?

71
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,810
Huh, there's a faded writing over here.

72
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,110
It seems "chiyoni" was written over

73
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,010
what was originally written here.

74
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,510
It's faded and hard to read.

75
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,210
But I think it's "weatherfish".

76
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,410
Which mean that the picture that was drawn

77
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,210
on the door below "chiyoni" was weatherfish.

78
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,810
But, "chiyoni" and weatherfish have no connection whatsoever.

79
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,110
If the drawing under the word "kachan" is a crow means "karasu" in Japanese,

80
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,910
then they are more or less connected.

81
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,410
Because when they crow, it sounds like they're saying "ka-ka".

82
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,110
Karasu...

83
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,310
But, maybe that picture is just something that the girl drew by

84
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,310
looking at the picture on the folding screen.

85
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,710
Then, that's a white heron?

86
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,510
White heron?

87
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,210
The director was saying a while ago

88
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,710
that a white heron was drawn on the folding screen

89
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,910
that was stolen from the mayor 4 years ago.

90
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,310
It seems to be of National Treasure class

91
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,810
and is said to be worth 2 billion.

92
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,210
Bird, white hero, weatherfish.

93
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,410
With all these clues out in the open, nothing.

94
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,910
Tiger symbolizes Osaka.

95
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,510
Eagle, Fukuoka.

96
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,310
And Carp Hiroshima.

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,510
Sea bream and flatfish would be the Dragon King's Castle.

98
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,510
The Dragon King's Castle?

99
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,810
That's it!

100
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,610
I think something's strange about Conan, after all.

101
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,610
Are you sure he's not lying about his age?

102
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,210
I don't think he is...

103
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,310
Kazuha, what did you just say?

104
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,410
I asked you what did you just say?

105
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,310
Maybe he's lying?

106
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,810
-Heiji? -Conan?

107
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,510
The time now is 10 to 6 in the morning.

108
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,410
More than 12 hours have passed since Ms. Taira's been found!

109
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,610
If our deduction is correct, it should still be here.

110
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,110
Yeah, it should still be there.

111
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,410
It's nowhere.

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,610
Darn. I wonder if the killer got rid of it, after all!

113
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,610
No, we overlooked it.

114
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,010
These little footprints of mine.

115
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,710
Then, that's a trick, after all.

116
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,510
Yeah, we were completely deceived.

117
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,210
But, what're we going to do?

118
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,910
We figured out the killer, but have no evidence.

119
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,810
If we got nothing, we just got to come up with something

120
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,310
by luring him out to this forest that the princess lies asleep in.

121
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,810
Yeah, although that princess may already be crying.

122
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,810
Heiji!

123
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,410
Conan!

124
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,410
Really, where are they anyway?

125
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,410
The nerve making us worry like this!

126
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,410
Oh, well. All is well since we found out.

127
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,310
Found out what?

128
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,310
Don't tell me...

129
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,310
Right, the trick that the killer used.

130
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,710
As well as the fact that the killer stayed near us all this time

131
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,410
but was playing against us!

132
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,110
What? You mean the killer is among us?

133
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,410
Who is it? Tell us who? Quick!

134
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,910
Not just yet.

135
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,810
We'll decide who it is after listening to what everybody has to say.

136
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,110
First of all, Mr. Kume.

137
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,610
Let's start from you.

138
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,610
It's going to be really short, so bear with me a while, okay?

139
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,110
Will the rest of you who are waiting decide the order in which

140
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,610
you want to be asked.

141
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,110
Hey, what's taking them so long?

142
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,810
They've already been in there for about 30 minutes.

143
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,810
I'm sure they'll be coming out soon.

144
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,010
After all, he did say it was going to be really simple.

145
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,610
Hey, hold it!

146
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,010
Heiji?

147
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,310
Hey, what's up?

148
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,210
Nothing's up! He ran away!

149
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,110
Ran away? This means he's the killer, after all.

150
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,310
It's because you made that sarcastic remark, Heiji.

151
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,010
You didn't have to say,

152
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,910
"If I have to wait for you to talk, I'll turn into Taro Urashima".

153
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,010
I didn't have a choice, did I?

154
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,710
Since he refused to talk no matter what I asked him.

155
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,210
Let's split up and find Mr. Kume.

156
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,710
If he committed suicide going into the ocean, it wouldn't be right.

157
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,710
Hey, Kume!

158
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,210
Where are you?

159
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,810
Mr. Kume!

160
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,010
Hey!

161
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,510
What the?

162
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,110
What're you surprised for? You're the one who told us

163
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,210
that if we don't want our souls to be taken by the death,

164
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,710
we should hold knives in our mouths.

165
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,010
Isn't it, Mr. Daito?

166
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,710
Mr. Kume, the man you're after is still in the house.

167
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,510
He's fast asleep, though.

168
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,410
I borrowed his clothes to catch you.

169
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,510
To get you who killed Ms. Taira and the captain,

170
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,510
as well as wait for Mr. Kume, who you thought was coming!

171
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,510
The three were the thieves who not only kidnapped Miyako,

172
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,710
but also stole the folding screen,

173
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,110
and on top of that killed the maid, right?

174
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,110
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

175
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,210
I was looking for Kume when I saw a suspicious silhouetted figure,

176
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,710
so I tried to catch him, that's all.

177
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,710
Besides, I couldn't have killed Ms. Taira, right?

178
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,110
The writing on the sand that was near that lady

179
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,010
was written right after the waves pulled away.

180
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,010
And you said it would've been impossible for me,

181
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,010
who was in the ship on the other side of the island to write it.

182
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,110
That's true.

183
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,610
Even if something is written on the sand before the tide pulls back,

184
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,010
it'll be washed away by the waves.

185
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,610
Therefore, it'd be impossible to leave the writing on the sand.

186
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,910
If it was really the waves that were pulling back then...

187
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,410
Come off it.

188
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,510
You saw it too, didn't you?

189
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,910
The sand was wet up to about a meter above the lady's head.

190
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,010
If the water was up there during high tide,

191
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,310
no matter how you think of it, the tide was receding, wasn't it?

192
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,110
That's we calculated wrong and were deceived.

193
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,310
The waves actually don't come up that far,

194
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,010
but because the sand was wet,

195
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,110
we mistakenly thought that during high tide,

196
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,710
the waves came all the way up there.

197
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,210
Right.

198
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,610
The time we found Ms. Taira was actually high tide.

199
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,710
If so, then it all fits just right, doesn't it?

200
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,810
If the tide is high, all you have to do

201
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,610
is write where the waves won't wash it away,

202
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,110
then lie Ms. Taira right next to the writing.

203
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,110
Okay, then why don't we go look for the writing right now?

204
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,410
Half a day has already passed since then.

205
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,910
If it was written where the waves wouldn't wash it away,

206
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,410
the writing would still be there, wouldn't it?

207
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,310
No, it was no longer there.

208
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,810
You probably erased it the minute we left the site, anyway.

209
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,210
Hey, hey.

210
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,510
But my footprints were still there.

211
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,610
When Heiji took the picture of my sandals and the writing.

212
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,510
I was standing right next to him.

213
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,910
But, my footprints were still there.

214
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,810
Yeah, but kiddo, the sand was wet all over...

215
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,610
I couldn't have wet the sand that way even if I used a bucket.

216
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,010
You didn't use a bucket.

217
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,310
You used the cruiser we came here on!

218
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,810
The waves that the cruiser created

219
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,510
wet the shore more than during high tide.

220
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,810
All you did was use it to your advantage.

221
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,310
You knew that the captain was going to go around the entire island

222
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,710
looking for the stuff in question

223
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,510
until it's time to leave.

224
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,010
And just what is that stuff in question supposed to be?

225
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,910
What else?

226
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,510
The anchor that I found.

227
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,910
He was looking for the "princess"

228
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,710
that was supposed to be tied onto the anchor.

229
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,110
"Princess"?

230
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,810
It was on the writing on the pillar, wasn't it?

231
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,310
The princess lies in A and not in B.

232
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,110
It's hard to understand what this means just as it is.

233
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,910
But if you put together the folk tale of Taro Urashima

234
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,510
and the fact that that this island is called Onikame Island,

235
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,510
then the puzzle fits...

236
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,910
The shell of the turtle.

237
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,310
Princess Oto lives in the Dragon King's Palace.

238
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,510
In other words,

239
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,310
the princess I's not in the sea, but on the shell of the turtle.

240
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,610
That is, it is in the forest on this island,

241
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,610
princess is a code name that the thieves called

242
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,510
the thing that was sunk in the ocean,

243
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,310
but was washed up on this island during the typhoon that struck a year ago.

244
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,610
This golden folding screen!

245
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,810
After they stole it, the thieves were at a loss

246
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,810
where to hide the folding screen,

247
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,610
so they put it in this air-tight case, tied it onto the boat,

248
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,510
sunk it deep into this part of the ocean that nobody dives into

249
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,310
with an anchor and decided to wait till things cooled off.

250
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,310
But, then a big typhoon hit a year ago.

251
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,310
And the boat was washed up to shore.

252
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,110
Although it was okay that one of the members came to see how things were,

253
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,310
but when the next typhoon hit,

254
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,910
the boat that the thief came on was washed away,

255
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,110
leaving him behind on this island.

256
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,010
That's why he left the writings

257
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,210
to indicate the whereabouts of the folding screen

258
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,210
for his fellow thieves.

259
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,910
And, since you figured out the meaning of the writing.

260
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,610
You decided to take revenge on the thieves

261
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,410
after hearing about the TV program

262
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,610
"Renown Detectives of the East VS. Renown Detectives of the West".

263
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,710
Since the thieves didn't know where the folding screen was yet,

264
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,510
you figured that there would be a high possibility

265
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,310
that the members of the thieves would come mixed up as the filming crew.

266
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,010
But, how would I be able to tell the thieves from the filming crew?

267
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,310
Taro Urashima.

268
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,310
See, like you were saying!

269
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,510
You feel like you turned into Taro Urashima.

270
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,910
You knew that the members of the band of thieves

271
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,410
who sunk the folding screen into the ocean,

272
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,410
would immediately figure out the meaning of the writings.

273
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,810
That's why you killed Ms. Taira

274
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,310
who came to look for it in the forest, right?

275
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,210
In the way that you tried to kill me a while ago.

276
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,910
It sure is an interesting deduction,

277
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,310
but, if that's the case, anybody could've committed the murder, right?

278
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,510
No, you're the one who committed the crime.

279
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,310
Unlike the captain who was killed violently,

280
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,610
Ms. Taira was treated as a corpse should be treated.

281
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,410
That's evidence that the killer knew that.

282
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,710
The true identity of Ms. Taira was actually the daughter of the Mayor,

283
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,110
Miyako who was kidnapped 5 years ago!

284
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,910
In other words, that kidnapping incident was made up

285
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,510
and Miyako herself was also a member of the band of thieves!

286
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,510
I realized that I figured out the meaning of why the thieves

287
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,010
called the folding screen "Hime" is Princess.

288
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,810
And the meaning of "Chiyoni" and "Kachan" that were written

289
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,810
by Miyako when she was little

290
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,010
and living in that house.

291
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,310
Folding screen was called "Hime"

292
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,310
because the name was taken from the Shirasagi Castle.

293
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:53,410
"Kachan" is the Karasu Castle, formally known as Miyamoto Castle.

294
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,710
In other words, it stands for Ms. Kako Miyamoto the maid.

295
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,810
"Chiyoni" came from the Chiyoda Castle,

296
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,610
which is also known as the Edo Castle.

297
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,710
The Edo Castle is a large castle that is located in the East.

298
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,810
Isn't that right? You who served as a butler at the Mayor's house,

299
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,310
Mr. Daito?

300
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:18,110
Although it seems that Miyako used to call you Mr. Dojo

301
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,410
with the "e" omitted in the beginning though.

302
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,210
I found out that you were the butler,

303
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,110
when you didn't sit but stood by the doorway.

304
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,510
You have a room but your chair is only in the kitchen.

305
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,510
The time when you suddenly opened the dish cabinet

306
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,510
when looking for the ashtray.

307
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,110
It was as if you knew there was no ashtray in this house, to begin with.

308
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,310
You're the one who prepared that tea cup

309
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,810
with the cigarette butts inside it beforehand too,

310
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,810
to make it look like the doings of multiple criminals, right?

311
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,310
You probably thought you'd get away for now somehow,

312
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,210
and was thinking of killing Mr. Kume who you goofed trying to kill later,

313
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,910
too bad you can't.

314
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,310
Because the rope you're holding now and the rope marks

315
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,910
around Miyako's neck are going to match completely.

316
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,610
But, there's still one thing I can't figure out.

317
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,610
I can understand that you found out about Mr. Kume after he got flustered

318
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,810
when he saw the picture of Miyako who he thought had died.

319
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,010
But how'd you figure that the captain was also one of them?

320
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,910
If you didn't predict that the captain

321
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,210
would make his rounds around this island,

322
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,710
this trick wouldn't have worked out.

323
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,010
How could I ever forget?

324
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,210
He was the only one that I witnessed four years back

325
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,410
at the time of the incident.

326
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,710
The very one who killed the one who was to be my wife my cherished loved one.

327
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,810
He is the hateful killer who killed her.

328
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,610
Which means that the maid, Ms. Matsumoto was...

329
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,410
Yes, I was engaged to her,

330
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,110
I asked the master for a leave to avenge her death.

331
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,110
I changed my outer appearance as well as my way of speech

332
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,010
speech in order to pursue the thieves.

333
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,010
But, I was shocked when I found out that Miyako was one of them.

334
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,610
Which means you didn't know?

335
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,710
No, because she looked so different.

336
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,210
Until she mumbled those few words.

337
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,710
I'm sorry, Chiyoni.

338
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,410
I felt like I understood for the first time just before her death,

339
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,710
about how she really felt.

340
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,610
That kidnapping incident was made up because after her mother died,

341
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,210
she wanted to test her step-father's love for her.

342
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,610
But, when Kaneshiro rejected to pay the ransom,

343
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,610
she decided to steal what Kaneshiro cherished,

344
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,410
and it was the folding screen.

345
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,010
Miyako was actually Kaneshiro's wife's child

346
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,310
from another marriage, after all.

347
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,510
Yes, now that I think back.

348
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,710
It could be that Mr. Kaneshiro knew

349
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,310
that Miyako was somehow involved in the incident.

350
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,510
Because when he gave me time off, this is what he said...

351
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,610
All this happened probably because of me.

352
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,610
So, hate me and forget about pursuing the incident, will you?

353
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,410
I think that this incident was just as the master said,

354
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,210
a box that shouldn't have been opened.

355
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,710
As if to speak on his behalf,

356
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,110
the golden folding screen was watching sadly over him.

357
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,910
Because the folding screen was suddenly exposed to air

358
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,410
after being sealed for so long and oxidized,

359
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,910
the paint began to run and fade,

360
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,310
resembling tears falling.

361
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,410
What?

362
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,510
The case has been solved?

363
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,210
Are you serious?

364
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,810
Yeah, while you were drinking and fell asleep feeling good.

365
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,310
Then what about my TV appearance? My pay?

366
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,610
How should I know, darn dude?

367
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,110
Then you make something happen!

368
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,210
Eat and run or anything you like.

369
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,510
Go on, do it!

370
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,010
Hey...

371
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,510
Oh, that's for me!

372
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,410
Detective Mouri is stretching over for his 12th bowl!

373
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,110
Renown detectives big eater contest.

374
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,210
Is this what you guys came to Okinawa to do?

375
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,710
Well, sort of...

376
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,910
Give me a break.

377
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,340
"Mail"
