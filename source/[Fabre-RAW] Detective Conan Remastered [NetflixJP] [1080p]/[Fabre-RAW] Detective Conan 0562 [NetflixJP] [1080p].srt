1
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:06,246
Anytime, anywhere.

2
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:09,246
Whenever and wherever, Nijimura is the bag.

3
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:12,446
Wet with water, no problem.

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,146
Bash, struck or hit, worry not!

5
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:17,346
Anytime! Anywhere!

6
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:19,046
Whenever and wherever,

7
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:20,846
you need a bag.

8
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,346
Get Nijimura!

9
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,546
Anytime! Anywhere!

10
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:28,946
Whenever and wherever, Nijimura is the bag.

11
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,046
Are Nijimura bags really selling that well?

12
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:34,946
Yeah. It's their rainbow colored trademark

13
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:36,246
that makes them so popular!

14
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:39,646
This is that popular?

15
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,146
Besides, Nijimura bags are very sturdy

16
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,046
and highly waterproof.

17
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:49,346
See. This zipper is said to be the same kind

18
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:51,146
that is used for scuba diving suits.

19
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:53,046
Even if you drop it into the water,

20
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,346
the contents inside don't get wet.

21
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:59,646
However, no doubt this is a celebrity brand,

22
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,546
there's one too many zeros...

23
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:04,146
No, two more than we can afford!

24
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:07,446
I was hoping to find an affordable pouch,

25
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:08,946
but I guess not.

26
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,246
Not too fast!

27
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:14,246
We've taken on President Nijimura's personal request.

28
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,546
If succeed seeing it through, pouch or poncho,

29
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:19,146
I'll buy you all you want!

30
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:22,946
They don't carry ponchos, you know.

31
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,846
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

32
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:27,046
President Nijimura should be here in a moment.

33
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,946
Someone! Help!

34
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,246
What was that?

35
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:34,146
Conan!

36
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:36,046
What are you doing?

37
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,646
Let me go!

38
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:41,746
Help!

39
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:43,146
President Nijimura!

40
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,146
A kidnapping!

41
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,046
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

42
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:56,646
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

43
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,646
Disclose the seven colored mystery

44
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:00,046
hidden behind rainbow colored bag after the rain.

45
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,746
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,646
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

47
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:06,346
No cases is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

48
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:53,002
"Rainbow Colored Kidnapping"

49
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:07,602
We had roadblocks set up five minute

50
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:09,502
after the incident occurred,

51
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:11,502
but failed to locate any suspicious vehicles.

52
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,502
Perhaps you misread the plate number?

53
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,102
That's impossible.

54
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,602
By the way, you are?

55
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:19,102
"Kenzo Katsuragi, age 45" -I'm Inspector Katsuragi from SID,

56
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:21,703
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

57
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,203
SID?

58
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,003
First division of the police headquarters,

59
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:28,102
the Special Investigation Department.

60
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,802
It's a section for handling hostage situations

61
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,802
such as kidnappings or hijackings.

62
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:36,302
Oh, you know a lot, don't you, sonny?

63
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:39,903
But then, why is a kid like you in a place like this?

64
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:44,102
I also witnessed the crime scene, so...

65
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:47,703
I'm sorry, we won't interfere with your work.

66
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:50,903
Detective, may I ask you to leave?

67
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:53,703
Investigating kidnapping for ransom is our job.

68
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,703
But we can't be sure

69
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,003
that this is a kidnapping case asking for ransom.

70
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,003
No, it's been confirmed.

71
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,602
"Saki Nijimura, age 35"

72
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:05,003
This was inside our mailbox.

73
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:07,203
Excuse me, but you are?

74
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,802
I'm Nijimura's wife, my name is Saki.

75
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,302
I'm the vice president of the company.

76
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,602
Allow me...

77
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,602
We have President Nijimura.

78
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:21,903
If you want him released,

79
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:25,203
put 100 million yen in a Nijimura handbag

80
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,703
and have Saki carry it.

81
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,703
At precisely 2.00pm, go to Touto Ikebukuro Station

82
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,102
and board the Blue Sky express train,

83
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:34,802
have her get off at the last stop, Okuho Station.

84
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,802
However, anytime, anywhere,

85
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:40,602
we will be watching closely.

86
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:44,602
If we see any authorities, the hostage will die.

87
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:49,302
From Black Rainbow?

88
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:51,302
Darn those jerks.

89
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:54,403
A hundred million yen ransom?

90
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:56,203
Any idea who they might be?

91
00:05:58,203 --> 00:05:59,503
To tell the truth...

92
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:04,203
We've always had problems with copied products of our brand.

93
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:06,903
We have just began filing a lawsuit.

94
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:10,903
It could be that companies like those

95
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,903
have a grudge against you, because of this.

96
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:16,302
It's plausible, since that anytime, anywhere in the ransom note

97
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:19,302
is Nijimura's catch phrase.

98
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:21,602
And also the name with black added

99
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,703
in front of rainbow trademark.

100
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:27,403
It's something that an illegal copy business would do.

101
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:28,703
Stop right there.

102
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,503
We will take over the investigation,

103
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:31,802
so leave immediately.

104
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,602
Hold it. Detective Mouri was actually contacted by my husband

105
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,302
to collect evidence pertaining to the lawsuit.

106
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:41,302
I'm also afraid to carry that much money all by myself,

107
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,802
so I'd like him to be my bodyguard.

108
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,302
Just count on me!

109
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,102
Allow me to carry it outside.

110
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:55,003
Oh, no, thanks.

111
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:03,003
Worry not! Anytime, anywhere...

112
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:10,802
"Touto Ikebukuro Station Inbound, Blue Sky express train"

113
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:17,503
Hey, why do you guys have to come?

114
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,003
As camouflage, didn't you say so yourself, Dad?

115
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:23,602
Yeah! Hiking...

116
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:26,903
Anytime, anywhere.

117
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:29,302
We don't know when or where the culprit may appear.

118
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,003
Understood.

119
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:13,102
Next stop is the last stop, Okuho Station...

120
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,703
You may transfer to the Koushu Express Line

121
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,003
or the Touto Okuho Line.

122
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:21,102
"Okuho Station"

123
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,803
Hey, let's hurry!

124
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,102
Oh, yeah...

125
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,703
Hurry up!

126
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:44,403
Yeah, right.

127
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,203
Madam, what did the culprit say?

128
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:47,203
Transfer now.

129
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:49,103
Transfer?

130
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:51,002
We'll be late for the train!

131
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:28,403
-We barely made it. -Thank goodness.

132
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,803
It would've taken forever to wait for the next train.

133
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,103
You're right.

134
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:46,603
I'll go this time.

135
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,203
Wow, it's so fast!

136
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:53,203
Let me see that paper.

137
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:56,403
Transfer to the Touto Okuho Line,

138
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:57,803
and when you reach the middle of the Nakatoro Bridge,

139
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,903
toss the ransom money bag outside.

140
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,203
What?

141
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,703
"Nakatoro Bridge"

142
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:10,703
This is...

143
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:12,403
What siren is that?

144
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:35,903
Shoots! The dam's being discharged!

145
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,903
What?

146
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,603
Oh, no! Darn, the culprit's plan is...

147
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,403
To flush away the bag!

148
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:52,603
I see, so that's why they demanded that the ransom

149
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:55,203
be put in a sturdy and waterproof Nijimura bag.

150
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,502
Darn, what a cunning criminal!

151
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,603
Contact the other squads! Downstream!

152
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:00,603
Have them go downstream!

153
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:01,603
Yes!

154
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,703
Are you all right?

155
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,103
Oh, yeah.

156
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,703
I'm sure your husband is fine.

157
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,002
Thank you.

158
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:17,603
What's this? What's eating at me?

159
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:19,903
I have this terrible feeling.

160
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:23,002
You still can't locate the bag?

161
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:26,103
I see, continue the search.

162
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,203
Our transmitter bug planted on the name tag

163
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,903
seems to have been damaged by the water.

164
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:37,103
Unfortunately, the terrible feeling I had,

165
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:39,203
soon became true.

166
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:42,002
The handbag swept away by the dam,

167
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,403
was retrieved at the riverbank five kilometers downstream.

168
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,403
But the 100 million yen inside the bag

169
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:52,002
was apparently taken by the culprit.

170
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,002
All we had left to do was to wait

171
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,803
for the release of the hostage, but...

172
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,002
The next morning,

173
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,803
along with the stolen vehicle that was used during the kidnapping,

174
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:06,803
the murdered body of President Nijimura was found.

175
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:10,002
Darling, why?

176
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,703
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,703
We will do everything we can to apprehend the culprit.

178
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:19,303
You're sorry? You don't even mean it!

179
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,303
It's because they spotted you police

180
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:22,403
that they killed my husband!

181
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:25,403
No, we didn't expose ourselves.

182
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,203
Madam, please calm down.

183
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:30,502
Then it was you! You were discovered by the culprit!

184
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,002
What kind of great detective are you?

185
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,303
No...

186
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:38,403
Inspector?

187
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:40,603
Regarding your husband's murder,

188
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,803
we've come across new information.

189
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,502
What?

190
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,828
The time Nijimura was murdered

191
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:59,928
was determined to be between 11.00am and noon yesterday.

192
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:03,428
What? He was kidnapped around 10.30am, so...

193
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:06,428
Those jerks! Hostages only get in their way,

194
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,428
so they killed him shortly after kidnapping him.

195
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:11,628
And still worked up the nerve to demand a ransom.

196
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,128
How horrible.

197
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,928
This...

198
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,328
You can't, Conan.

199
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,528
Why's that kid here?

200
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:23,128
The name tag with the bag is missing.

201
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,728
Stay out of this! Here!

202
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,528
Sorry about that.

203
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:29,928
Let's go, Conan.

204
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:35,728
At any rate, the culprit is a cold, ruthless and sly.

205
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,328
This is a murder case.

206
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:41,228
Katsuragi, we will be joining the investigation from here.

207
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:42,428
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:45,028
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Why at a time like this, you may think,

209
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:47,328
but, no, because it is a time like this,

210
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,228
I have to respond to the love

211
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,928
and support shown to our Nijimura bags.

212
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,228
I hereby vow to work

213
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:55,128
to live up the reputation of the company.

214
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,828
And, regarding the fake products

215
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:01,028
that have been troubling our beloved customers,

216
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:03,328
I demand that law enforcement authorities

217
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:05,828
reinforce efforts to fight copyright infringement

218
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,728
until total annihilation has been achieved!

219
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:09,728
Where are you going, Dad?

220
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:11,228
Where else?

221
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,528
Recheck the crime scenes thoroughly.

222
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:13,728
It's the motto of the police,

223
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,328
no, rather for detectives too!

224
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,928
In that case, I'll go too!

225
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:19,028
Don't be stupid!

226
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,928
How can I work when a kid's with me?

227
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,528
However, I was at the scene from the beginning this time.

228
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:26,828
If you forget or miss something,

229
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,828
I might be able to pick it up.

230
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,828
Don't you dare talk back to me.

231
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,428
See, two heads are better than one.

232
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:34,028
Three heads are better than two.

233
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,428
-What? -I was at the scene from the beginning too.

234
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,228
So I won't let you leave me behind.

235
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:41,428
Okay.

236
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:46,428
"Nijimura Office Backdoor"

237
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,528
The incident started here.

238
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,228
How scary,

239
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:52,928
to think that the kidnapping happened right in front of us.

240
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:59,328
The police set up road blocks immediately,

241
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:01,728
yet they failed to spot the criminal.

242
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,728
Carrying the ransom,

243
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,328
Saki boarded the Blue Sky express train.

244
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:10,328
"Okuho Station" -She then transferred here, at Okuho Station.

245
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:13,128
Most likely, this was the culprit's attempt

246
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,428
to distract the police.

247
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,228
Then, as the train she transferred to,

248
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,628
was just about to pass the bridge,

249
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,028
she tossed the bag into the river

250
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:24,528
from the window of the train.

251
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:28,528
That was just when the dam was scheduled to be discharged water.

252
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,628
Thus, the bag was swept away

253
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,628
by the increased amount of water and current of the river.

254
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:35,828
When it was finally found at the riverbank five kilometers downstream,

255
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,828
the ransom money had already been taken by the culprit.

256
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,728
By the way, the name tag that was rigged with the transmitter

257
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,728
wasn't found on the bag, right?

258
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,428
The bag tumbled downstream due to the force of the current,

259
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:54,828
so the tag must've fallen off.

260
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,428
The discharge from the dam was surprisingly strong.

261
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:00,728
To think it could have pushed a bag weighing ten kilograms

262
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,928
over a distance of five kilometers.

263
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,928
Yeah, Saki must've been carrying a lot of weight.

264
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,128
Come to think of it, at that time...

265
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:11,328
Allow me to carry it outside.

266
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:13,728
Oh, no, thanks, I'll be all right.

267
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:17,828
Don't tell me...

268
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:21,628
Don't tell me...

269
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,028
The rain stopped.

270
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,228
You're right.

271
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:28,328
Hey, look at that!

272
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,128
Oh, a rainbow!

273
00:16:30,128 --> 00:16:31,328
Beautiful!

274
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:34,828
Red, orange, yellow, green,

275
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,428
blue, indigo, violet!

276
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:44,328
I see, so that's what it is!

277
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,328
Hello, Nijimura speaking.

278
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,928
It's me, Kogoro Mouri.

279
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,128
I've figured out who kidnapped and killed your husband.

280
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:56,828
Are you sure?

281
00:16:56,828 --> 00:17:00,528
Your press conference served as a hint.

282
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:04,928
Tomorrow morning, I will reveal the truth at the riverbank

283
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:07,828
under the bridge where the bag was tossed.

284
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:08,928
Bye.

285
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,128
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What did you say?

286
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,728
You know who the culprit is?

287
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,128
Really, Inspector?

288
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:22,328
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

289
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,428
Under that bridge, you say?

290
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,428
Right that!

291
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,128
Now, for the finale.

292
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:57,328
-What? -The wife?

293
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,528
That's the ransom money?

294
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:05,628
But wasn't the bag swept away?

295
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,528
Explain this to us, Mr. Mouri.

296
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:11,628
What? Well, I'm the one who wants to ask, Inspector.

297
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,028
What exactly do you...

298
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:22,728
The bag we found downstream was a dummy.

299
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,428
If you toss the bag into a dam that is discharge,

300
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:29,428
people would think it'd get washed away downstream.

301
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:31,128
That was your diversionary tactic.

302
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:35,728
Detective Takagi, try emptying the bag.

303
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:36,828
Yes, sir, right away.

304
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:42,628
This bag...

305
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:45,328
why is it so heavy even when it's empty?

306
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:46,628
What...

307
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,028
This is...

308
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,228
An iron plate?

309
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:00,928
Don't tell me...

310
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:05,028
Correct because of the metal weight planted inside the bag,

311
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:08,628
the bag stayed under the bridge until now.

312
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:09,928
We have been fooled

313
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:13,628
by the culprit into believing the dummy bag

314
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:16,828
at the downstream riverbank was real.

315
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:17,928
You must've panicked

316
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:21,328
when you heard that I've reveal the truth here tomorrow morning.

317
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,028
As such, you came to quickly collect the money.

318
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:27,828
No, the bag that would've otherwise been unnecessary.

319
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,728
Because you didn't want us to find out that the bag downstream,

320
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:32,528
unlike the bag with ransom money in it,

321
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:36,928
was a fake.

322
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,728
A fake?

323
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,128
That bag was?

324
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,628
Although they look alike,

325
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:45,028
the fake bag has a slightly different color arrangement

326
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:47,228
than the real one.

327
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,228
Isn't that right?

328
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:55,428
This kidnapping case started off strange to begin with.

329
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,328
The kidnapper seated the hostage

330
00:19:57,328 --> 00:20:00,628
in the passenger's seat without restraint.

331
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:02,128
In other words, the kidnapping was actually staged

332
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:06,328
by Saki and Mr. Nijimura.

333
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:07,628
They wanted none other than me,

334
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:12,628
Kogoro Mouri to become a witness.

335
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,428
As to why the kidnapper's car

336
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:16,528
wasn't caught in your timely roadblock.

337
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:18,828
It was because they hid themselves

338
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,928
in a parking garage near the scene.

339
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,728
But immediately after that,

340
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:27,028
you killed Nijimura in the garage.

341
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:34,128
The rest was simply your solo play.

342
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:38,228
You mailed yourself the ransom note.

343
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:40,228
Then, you prepared the kidnapper's instructions yourself

344
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:44,128
while you were among the crowd of passengers at the station,

345
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:48,728
and made it look as if the culprit was really there.

346
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:53,928
But Saki, why did you use a fake bag as your dummy?

347
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:55,828
If you used a genuine bat,

348
00:20:55,828 --> 00:21:00,528
perhaps your plan wouldn't have been exposed.

349
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:04,328
I could never have done that.

350
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:08,828
Nijimura's products are my adorable children.

351
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:10,528
So...

352
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:14,428
I could never damage any of them.

353
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:16,928
Not ever!

354
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,628
That's why you used a fake.

355
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:23,228
After all, those fake items are to blame

356
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,928
for the financial deficit our company's been going through.

357
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:28,928
Despite this, that man cut a deal with the fake company,

358
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:31,228
getting dirty money from them.

359
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,928
He then used all the money up gambling

360
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:35,128
and ran deeply in debt.

361
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,028
I can't believe he came up with this staged kidnapping idea

362
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,728
to pay off his debts.

363
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:43,328
That's why I pretended to agree and took him down!

364
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:46,328
This brand is what I created to begin with,

365
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:50,428
and is a result of my design, you know?

366
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:54,028
I only wanted to take it back!

367
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:00,028
Anytime, anywhere...

368
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,128
Since it was her handmade bag,

369
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:06,128
be it submerged in the water or the dam discharge,

370
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:09,028
it would definitely protect the 100 million yen.

371
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,428
Betting on her confidence and pride,

372
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:14,028
she committed the crime...

373
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:18,028
and lost.

374
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,545
"Mouri Detective Agency"

375
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:49,145
How beautiful! A rainbow across the sky!

376
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:51,245
Conan! Dad!

377
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:59,645
There's a leg across my head.

378
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,240
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,100
"Masked eyes"

380
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,040
Stop it! If you cover my eyes, I can't see the truth.

381
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,300
You always can't anyway, Pops.
