1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,938
Man's voi Raita, Hatsune!

2
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:06,338
Congratulations to your marriage!

3
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:12,238
Oh well, even if you congratulate us now,

4
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:13,638
our wedding's tomorrow.

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,438
"Raita Banba (37), Groom" -It's not like we're married yet.

6
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:19,238
"Hatsune Kamon (37), Bride" -No big deal. Tonight's our wedding eve.

7
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:20,838
After we finish the wedding,

8
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:23,438
we're going to fly off to our honeymoon right away.

9
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:24,838
True.

10
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,538
Love birds.

11
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:27,838
How I envy you!

12
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:30,138
Hey, long time no see, Mouri.

13
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:33,038
So he's the famed detective?

14
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:37,338
Yeah, he's my bad friend in my high school day, Kogoro Mouri.

15
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,838
How do you do? I'm Hatsune.

16
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:41,338
Well, hello, hello.

17
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:44,638
Which means the two beside you are your...

18
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:47,538
I'm his daughter, Ran.

19
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:49,438
I'm freeloader, Conan.

20
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:53,038
He's staying with us temporarily.

21
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,738
I hear that you both fell in love at first sight.

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,338
Yeah, I felt it was destiny the instant we met.

23
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:02,038
It was like we finally found each other.

24
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,838
I mean after all, our birthdays, blood types,

25
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:06,538
and the environment we come from are the same.

26
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,038
Sometimes even we understand each other mutually

27
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:11,138
without saying a word too.

28
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,338
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,038
-Hey! -I'm sorry.

30
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:21,338
-My God! It's stuck all over my pants. -Oh, no.

31
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:23,838
You're stepping on the cake.

32
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,238
I'm really sorry.

33
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:27,738
This is my first day part-timing here.

34
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:28,838
Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,438
But, will you please bring a wet towel

36
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,638
that we can use to wipe the pants off?

37
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:35,038
Yes, ma'am, right away.

38
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:39,838
Hey, stop giving the eye just because that waiter's good-looking.

39
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:42,238
Are you jealous?

40
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:43,238
Of course not.

41
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:45,238
You haven't changed.

42
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,638
You got fast hands and you're always jealous.

43
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:48,938
Knock it off.

44
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:53,538
You used to glare at the guys who gave passes to Eri too, didn't you?

45
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:55,938
-What? -Is that true?

46
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,438
Good grief.

47
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,438
It's too tough keeping up with the possessiveness

48
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,538
of all the kings, don't you think?

49
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,238
Where are you going?

50
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,738
To the nail salon.

51
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:08,138
To get my nails a deco chip for my wedding.

52
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:10,738
You don't have to do something like that.

53
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,438
It's raining pretty hard.

54
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,938
I've got to. I've already made reservations too.

55
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:17,838
Besides, all the employees at the salon are women,

56
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,838
so there's no need to worry.

57
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,638
I told you before, but...

58
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:24,238
If you cheat on me, I'll make you pay.

59
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:27,038
That's my line.

60
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:28,138
Honey.

61
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,638
I'll be back in about two hours,

62
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:35,338
so when I do take a look at my nails, okay?

63
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:36,338
Okay.

64
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:41,238
She should put them on just before her wedding ceremony.

65
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:44,238
Because she'll be taking them off before she goes to sleep anyway.

66
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:48,538
I hear that you keep nail chips on for 24 hours straight.

67
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,238
Even when you take a bath?

68
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,238
Yes.

69
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,738
Woman really have it tough.

70
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:59,538
The vivid coloured memories of summer.

71
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:01,538
Solve mysteries all season round.

72
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:03,238
An unbelievable car explosion.

73
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,338
Attack the two on their wedding eve.

74
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:06,838
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,138
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:11,338
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:57,898
"Wedding Eve (Part 1)"

78
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,698
Come on, it's my last night as a bachelor,

79
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,098
so come on be nice to me, will you?

80
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:05,798
Really, Banba...

81
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:07,598
Your wife's going to get at you, you know?

82
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,998
Good grief,

83
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:13,898
he's already got himself a beautiful wife and yet...

84
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,598
Really, he's just like somebody I know excuse me, sir.

85
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,398
Excuse me.

86
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,898
You again?

87
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:24,898
What is it now?

88
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:27,398
Your phone's been ringing repeatedly from a while ago.

89
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:28,798
If you will excuse me, then...

90
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:29,798
Yeah.

91
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,698
It's a mail from Hatsune.

92
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:35,798
You're not answering the phone,

93
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:37,298
so I'm sending you a picture of it.

94
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:39,998
You'll get to see the real thing in 30 minutes.

95
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:42,398
What's with you? You're lovey-dovey!

96
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:44,598
-Well, sort of... -Well, thanks a lot.

97
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,298
Sorry, I gotta go to the john.

98
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:48,698
-Bye. -Bye.

99
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:52,098
A second cell phone?

100
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,498
He's talking to somebody wearing a dreadful look.

101
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:00,098
He hung up right away.

102
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:03,598
And, he's going straight to the john...

103
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:07,698
Which means that the person he's talking to is in the toilet.

104
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,998
What's the matter, Conan?

105
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,598
Did you see anyone you know?

106
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,898
No, it's nothing.

107
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,398
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

108
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:21,098
"Sanji Haruoka (48), Customer"

109
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,298
Don't tell me...

110
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,898
that guy was on the other end of the line?

111
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:25,898
Waiter!

112
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,298
Yes.

113
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:28,798
Thank you for waiting.

114
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,598
Bourbon on the rocks.

115
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,198
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,998
Be careful, idiot!

117
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,598
I... I'm sorry.

118
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,798
Banba, you're drinking too much.

119
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:42,598
I'm fine. Fine.

120
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,298
-Hey, waiter. -Yes?

121
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:48,598
Do you remember what I ordered?

122
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,098
Yes, Bourbon on the rocks, right?

123
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,498
Okay. You got it right.

124
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:54,498
Then...

125
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:59,398
Banba, what's that scary look on your face for?

126
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:02,198
It's nothing.

127
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:07,598
This party is like a reunion to you too, isn't it, Pops?

128
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,798
Yeah, it seems that the bride-to-be had her wedding party

129
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,598
on a different day so...

130
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,498
Mom couldn't come because of work, though.

131
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:19,898
Then, is that man wearing sunglasses also your classmate?

132
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,198
I don't remember.

133
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:26,598
I mean, it's already been 20 years, after all.

134
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:42,598
Hello.

135
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,098
Yes, that's right.

136
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,498
Yes.

137
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:48,998
Yes, and?

138
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:50,798
Yes, yes.

139
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,598
Hey, just what're you doing?

140
00:07:58,598 --> 00:07:59,898
Oh, well...

141
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:03,398
This guest suddenly started to punch me.

142
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:04,798
Are you all right?

143
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:05,998
Don't touch me!

144
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,398
Banba.

145
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:10,498
You drank too much.

146
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:13,398
-Your hand is bleeding. -It's no darn big deal.

147
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,798
No big deal... Hey, you should get it treated.

148
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:18,098
Banba, are you listening, or what?

149
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,798
The only one I need to talk to now is Hatsune.

150
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,798
Hey, Hatsune?

151
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:25,998
Where are you now?

152
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,598
Goodbye?

153
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,298
What're you talking about, Hatsune?

154
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:32,498
Hey, Hatsune?

155
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,998
Hatsune? Where are you now?

156
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:41,898
Don't tell me... that the car is Hatsune's.

157
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,198
-What? -Oh, no.

158
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,898
Ran, call the fire department, the ambulance and the police!

159
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:46,898
Okay!

160
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,598
-Store manager! Where's the fire extinguisher? -Hatsune.

161
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:49,698
-Yes, it's here! -Hatsune.

162
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,498
-Okay! It's dangerous... -Hatsune.

163
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,798
-so don't let anyone out of the restaurant! -Are you all right?

164
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,998
-Yes, sir! -Hatsune!

165
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:59,098
"Hatsune Kamon"

166
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,798
Hatsune!

167
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,798
The body is burnt black

168
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,498
and we're having the dental records for a match right now.

169
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,298
It is highly probable that the victim is...

170
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:17,398
the owner of this car, Ms. Hatsune Kamon.

171
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,198
Is it true that a phone call was received

172
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:20,798
from Ms. Kamon just before the car burned

173
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,898
hinting that she may be wanting to commit suicide?

174
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,798
-Yes. -Inspector.

175
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:30,898
There are two large travel suitcases in the trunk.

176
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:35,498
They were probably getting ready to go on a honeymoon.

177
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:37,898
Because the woman who passed away was supposed to get married

178
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:40,998
to my old friend tomorrow.

179
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,698
But, why would such a happy person commit suicide?

180
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,098
I wonder...

181
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:48,998
Maybe she had what you call the marriage blues or something?

182
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:51,698
Officer Takagi.

183
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:54,698
-Hey! Not you again! -Come, come.

184
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:55,898
What is it, Conan?

185
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,698
This is a fake nail, isn't it?

186
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,098
True. But why would it be in a place like this?

187
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,598
Ms. Kamon left the party

188
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:06,498
saying that she was going to a nail salon

189
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:08,398
about two hours ago.

190
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,398
What?

191
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:15,298
Maybe it's better not to conclude that she committed suicide yet.

192
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:19,398
What? A murder?

193
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:20,898
You mean it's not suicide?

194
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:21,898
Yeah.

195
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:23,098
Although very slight,

196
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:27,198
there was skin stuck on the tip of the fake nail that Conan found.

197
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:30,498
I hear that she just got those fake nails put on her just a while ago.

198
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,898
Which means that it is highly likely

199
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,598
that the skin on the fake nail is of the culprit

200
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,398
that she fought with near the car.

201
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:39,998
Who on earth...

202
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:42,498
Who could've killed Hatsune?

203
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,198
You're Raita Banba,

204
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,498
who was married to Ms. Kamon, aren't you?

205
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:49,398
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,198
Where did you hurt your hand?

207
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,498
I... I hurt myself a while ago when I fell

208
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:56,298
and cut myself with the shattered piece of the cracked glass cup.

209
00:10:57,298 --> 00:11:00,798
Then, does this hairbrush look familiar to you?

210
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,098
Yeah, that's mine.

211
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:06,398
I had it in my travel suitcase, though.

212
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,698
Yes, it was in your suitcase

213
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,898
that was in the trunk of the car that burned.

214
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,498
Just in case we checked the DNA from he hair we gathered from this brush

215
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:18,798
and as a result found a match.

216
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,798
It almost matched the DNA of the skin

217
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:24,398
that was found on the tip of her fake nail.

218
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:26,398
What?

219
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:33,498
Just what are you talking about?

220
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,498
Are you saying that I'm the culprit or what?

221
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:36,498
Oh, no...

222
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:39,398
Because it's still not a perfect match.

223
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,498
If possible we would like to get your approval

224
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,698
to perform a more accurate test.

225
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,098
You must be joking!

226
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,798
Cool it, Banba.

227
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:48,398
You didn't do it, right?

228
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:50,798
-Of course not. -But...

229
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:53,098
It's thinkable that she scratched him trying to resist his attack,

230
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,798
and in order to hide the wound that he got then,

231
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,798
he could've deliberately punched me

232
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,498
to make it look like he hurt himself then, right?

233
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,698
Why, how dare you?

234
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:03,398
Look who's talking.

235
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:06,198
I'll bet you killed your dear darling

236
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,198
before she fell into the arms of someone else,

237
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,798
didn't you, Mr. waiter?

238
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,698
Hey, hold it.

239
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,398
What is this about?

240
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:15,998
If you're not going to say it yourself,

241
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:18,098
I'll say it for you.

242
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:21,498
He's Hatsune's lover

243
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,898
and they've been seeing each other secretly!

244
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:24,098
What?

245
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:26,298
Is that true?

246
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:28,898
How about it?

247
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:32,198
Of course I've been seeing her.

248
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:35,498
After all, I was hired by her.

249
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:37,398
I'm a private eye.

250
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,798
"Tohru Amuro (29)" -A detective.

251
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,298
Detective?

252
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:50,777
A detective.

253
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:52,677
Isn't it strange?

254
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:54,577
Why would a detective that is hired by Hatsune

255
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:57,477
coincidentally be working at a restaurant that Hatsune and I

256
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,977
are holding our wedding party?

257
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,877
It's not a coincidence.

258
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:06,377
I had her choose this restaurant to hold the wedding party

259
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:09,277
after I got hired to work here part-time.

260
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,377
But, why on earth?

261
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:15,477
Of course to keep an eye on your actions.

262
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:16,877
To keep an eye on me?

263
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:19,877
Yes, that's what Hatsune asked me to do.

264
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:21,477
She wanted me to check if you,

265
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,277
who had a habit of flirting had any other lover

266
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:24,877
and wanted me to keep an eye on you.

267
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:29,077
That's why I deliberately smeared your pants with the cake.

268
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:31,377
So that no other women would approach you.

269
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:36,377
Even if I wanted to prove that she had asked me to do all this,

270
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:39,877
since Hatsune seems to have burned to death

271
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,977
in the parking lot of this restaurant.

272
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:45,977
However the fact that I was hired by her,

273
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,477
can probably be proven

274
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,977
by that man wearing sunglasses over there, correct?

275
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,577
It seems that he was around when I was reporting

276
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:56,677
what I found out about Mr. Banba's surrounding to Hatsune.

277
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,677
Who on earth are you?

278
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,677
Well...

279
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:02,577
He's probably a detective too.

280
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:03,977
A detective?

281
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,977
The one who hired him is the groom, Mr. Banba.

282
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,677
He probably asked him to check on Hatsune

283
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:13,077
because she seems to be going with somebody recently.

284
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:16,077
Although he was able to catch her secretly meeting someone,

285
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:18,677
since the guy she was seeing was wearing a cap and a hood,

286
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,377
he couldn't figure out what the man looked like.

287
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:23,377
But since the voice of the of the man

288
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:25,777
that he heard then sounded like that of the waiter,

289
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:28,277
he called me to the table to place his order.

290
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:31,077
After confirming my voice matched that of the man,

291
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:33,277
he probably sent a signal to Mr. Banba

292
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:36,577
that the man and I were one and the same.

293
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,177
He called Mr. Banba on the cell phone

294
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,077
and got him to come to the men's room,

295
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:43,677
to tell him that the man in question

296
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,477
is probably in this restaurant so he would check from now.

297
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:47,577
Isn't that right?

298
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:49,877
Yeah, that's right.

299
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:53,277
I had no idea that you were a detective.

300
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:56,177
You got away each time I tailed you too, so...

301
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,877
But, Mr. Banba,

302
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:02,077
did you still want to marry her

303
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:04,777
knowing that she was going out with some mysterious man?

304
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:06,877
I think it's more natural to go ask her yourself, no?

305
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,277
The detective told me

306
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:11,477
that she hasn't been seeing the guy after that secret meeting,

307
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,377
and besides, I thought that she'd hate me if she found out

308
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,977
that I hired a detective to check on her.

309
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,477
We were so close that even disclosed to each other

310
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:21,677
that we were both foster children too so...

311
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:23,177
So, that's what Mr. Banba meant

312
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:25,377
when he said they came from the same surroundings...

313
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,077
If you hired me,

314
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,577
I would've seen through immediately that this slip of a boy

315
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,977
was a detective right away.

316
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,577
How could I have asked you!

317
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:34,977
You're famous and everybody knows what you look like.

318
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,077
And besides, I was going to introduce you to her later anyway.

319
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:40,677
But, if you let me handle it,

320
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:43,277
maybe she wouldn't have committed suicide either.

321
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,877
Maybe she set fire to the car she was inside

322
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:49,877
because this guy kept reporting to her

323
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,677
on the phone about all the misconduct

324
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:53,177
we were displaying at this restaurant.

325
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,977
I... I made no such phone call to her.

326
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:59,577
Besides, he was drunk and just frolicking,

327
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,477
so even if I did report all of that on the phone,

328
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,077
it's unthinkable that it would lead her to commit suicide.

329
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:04,777
Talking of phone calls...

330
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:10,277
Mr. Banba, you called her just before the car caught fire

331
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:13,777
and received a message hinting that she would be committing suicide.

332
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:16,777
Yes, she was crying as she said "Goodbye".

333
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,477
I see.

334
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,877
If you doubt me...

335
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,677
See, tonight at 8:54 pm.

336
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,577
The call history is right here, isn't it?

337
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:26,877
Please let me take a look at it.

338
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,577
What time did you contact the police?

339
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:34,177
Well... 9:21 pm.

340
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,877
There seems to be close to a 30 minute time difference.

341
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,177
How should I know!

342
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,777
That...

343
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:41,977
I'm the one who made the call.

344
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,577
It took me some time because I was making calls for an ambulance

345
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,377
and to the fire department too.

346
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:49,877
But, by the time the ambulance and all got here,

347
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:51,677
it seems that it was burning so bad

348
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,977
that much couldn't be done at that point already.

349
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:56,377
But, isn't it strange?

350
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:59,077
Normally the place where people get into the car

351
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,377
is made with burn proof materials,

352
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:03,377
and yet, why was it burned so badly?

353
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,477
That's true.

354
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,777
It seems to have exploded on and off too.

355
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,777
Oh, it's because of the spray can.

356
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:11,977
There were a lot of spray cans and paper

357
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:15,277
in the car and those things caught fire, that's why.

358
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:17,477
Why were things like that in the car?

359
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:22,077
We were going to spray the car placing a pattern on it

360
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:24,877
and decorate the car after the party.

361
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,477
We were going to go to the wedding hall

362
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,777
in the car that we decorated

363
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,377
and surprise everybody.

364
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,777
If you think I'm lying look at my mail.

365
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:37,577
I received mail from her that she got all the stuff together.

366
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:44,277
You seemed to have received mail from her at 8:18 pm

367
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,477
saying that she'd be returning in 30 minutes.

368
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:51,077
Yes. She sent me a photo mail from the nail salon.

369
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,977
Which means...

370
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:57,177
That you knew she had a lot of easily burnable items in her car

371
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:02,377
as well as the time she would be coming back to this restaurant, no?

372
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,677
Hey.

373
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,477
What the heck are you getting at?

374
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:10,877
In other words, you could've secretly left the restaurant,

375
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:13,877
ambush her at the parking lot pass her out,

376
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:17,577
shove her into the car, set fire to it and burn her to death!

377
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:18,977
Hey, hey, hey.

378
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:20,177
Moreover, near the car,

379
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:25,177
the fake nail that she just got put on this evening was found,

380
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:26,877
and on the tip of that fake nail,

381
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,977
a tiny portion of skin was found.

382
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,377
Hey...

383
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,477
From the circumstances, it's most likely

384
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,977
that this skin adhered to the tip of the nail

385
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:39,177
when she resisted by scratching when she was attacked.

386
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:43,177
The DNA of that skin virtually matched the DNA that was collected

387
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:46,377
from the hair of your hairbrush.

388
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:49,977
But, it wasn't a perfect match, was it?

389
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:53,377
Hey! You tell him something too, Mouri!

390
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:55,277
"Virtually" I think means...

391
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:57,577
that the skin that was found on the fake nail

392
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,777
was contaminated by rain and dirt,

393
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:03,277
therefore, a perfect data couldn't be taken.

394
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,577
Unless you're blood-related,

395
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,077
a perfect match of the genome genetic information

396
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,477
is virtually impossible.

397
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,777
Taking this into consideration...

398
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:14,377
It's more natural to think that the DNA...

399
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:17,177
is one of the same person.

400
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,377
Why you?

401
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,477
No violence please.

402
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,277
Mr. Mouri, please stop him.

403
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:28,077
I don't want him punching me again.

404
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:30,477
It's not necessary.

405
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:33,477
-Darn. -Hey, Banba, cool it.

406
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:35,977
It hasn't been concluded yet

407
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:38,577
that the hair on your hairbrush is yours yet.

408
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,677
Why don't you let them check your DNA

409
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:42,577
and get accurate test results.

410
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:44,677
-Just as I thought. -They're just going to get some DNA sample

411
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,577
-If I remember correctly... -from your mouth and check it.

412
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:48,477
Then, how did he...

413
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:49,677
Okay, then, Mr. Banba.

414
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:54,577
You agree to take the DNA test, correct?

415
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:55,577
Yeah.

416
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,077
Please come this way then.

417
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:03,777
But,

418
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:06,377
DNA test is really something, isn't it?

419
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:10,577
In the past, all we could get from saliva was the blood type and yet,

420
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,577
today you can tell who it really belongs to.

421
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:15,177
Yes, I guess so.

422
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:17,977
Then, you'd be able to disclose

423
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:19,777
the real identity of anyone under disguise.

424
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:22,977
Yes, I guess so.

425
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:28,077
Everything will come to light after the results are out but...

426
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,277
If he were to be the culprit,

427
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:33,077
why would something like that be left behind?

428
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:35,677
Or, is there some trick involved here?

429
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,277
If so, why doesn't he say anything about it?

430
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:05,777
Inspector Megure.

431
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,777
There's one door at the back of this restaurant

432
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:12,577
that leads to the parking lot.

433
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:16,677
But, since it was raining hard when the incident occurred,

434
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:18,677
that door seemed to have been locked.

435
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:20,177
Which means in order to get out of the restaurant,

436
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:23,377
there was no other way than to go through the front entrance?

437
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:24,477
Yes.

438
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:28,677
But if so, I'm sure that one of the guests would've remembered.

439
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:31,177
Are there no other way in and out of the restaurant?

440
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:34,277
You could try to make it out of the window of the toilet.

441
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,777
But, outside the window the road is not paved

442
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:39,077
and there's a big puddle,

443
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:40,477
so if anyone did pass through here,

444
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:44,777
there should be some traces of footprints left behind.

445
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:48,677
At the time of the incident, it seems to have been windy,

446
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:51,177
because Hatsune's umbrella was found

447
00:22:51,177 --> 00:22:53,877
blown to the very end of the parking lot.

448
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:55,377
Wind?

449
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:57,777
Come to think of it,

450
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,277
when we got to this restaurant it was pretty windy.

451
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:05,477
And? Do you detectives have anything that comes to mind?

452
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:06,777
Not in particular.

453
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:09,977
When I told him that she was secretly seeing some other man,

454
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,977
he was quite out of sorts

455
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:13,977
but recently it seems that he was more concerned

456
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,677
about the fact that she was secretly talking to somebody over the phone.

457
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:21,877
Well, but she was only probably contacting this guy.

458
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:26,677
Oh, no. I contacted her only by mail.

459
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:28,477
The only time I met her outside was just once,

460
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,277
the time you saw her with me.

461
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:34,777
Only there was just one time when her face clouded.

462
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,477
-Her face clouded? -Yes.

463
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:39,177
I'm a detective so,

464
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:42,477
I was checking in detail on Banba.

465
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:45,777
Then I found out about something.

466
00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:47,377
Found out about something?

467
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:51,377
He and Hatsune were both rescued from a hotel fire.

468
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:53,577
Although both their identities weren't known,

469
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,277
they were raised in the same church.

470
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,720
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,480
"Cake".

472
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,200
Three detectives let's be selective.

473
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,060
What a goofy rhyme.

474
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,260
That's an old gag.

475
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,740
Good grief.
