1
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,330
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,430
Step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,930
A pond that changes color with the passing of time turns crimson.

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,030
And the case is solved.

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,430
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,430
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,930
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,390
We attended a tea ceremony on behalf of Sonoko and her father

9
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,390
that were to be held at Aonogi residence.

10
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,090
There is a pond in the garden where the color of the water

11
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,590
changes into five different hues.

12
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,690
And in the center of it

13
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,290
is a tearoom that is accessed by a connection corridor.

14
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,790
We were enjoying ourselves looking at the pond

15
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,390
when the incident occurred.

16
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,590
The master had hung himself and died!

17
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,990
Moreover, he died exactly like legend had it.

18
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,490
No, this is not suicide.

19
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,690
It's homicide!

20
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,690
I'm sure that someone here

21
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,690
schemed a very clever trick and killed the master

22
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,990
after making it look like he committed suicide!

23
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,290
Who could have done this?

24
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,590
Who is pretending to be the monster?

25
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,890
"The Legend Of The Five Colored Water Palace (Part 2)"

26
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,090
So, at a little after 4pm

27
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,590
when everyone gathered in this room,

28
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,590
you all saw the master's corpse from this veranda, right?

29
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,990
Yes.

30
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,390
The water of the pond was just changing crimson.

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,890
And besides, Ryoichi looked at his wristwatch to confirm the time.

32
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,390
Yes.

33
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,190
It was 4pm sharp.

34
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,490
I looked towards the tea room then,

35
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,890
but my father's corpse was still not there.

36
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,490
It happened right after Ms. Mimura returned.

37
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,790
Where were you all at that time?

38
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,190
I was taking a bath for about 30 minutes.

39
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,990
I had some business to attend to and went out for a while.

40
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,090
Where did you go?

41
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,090
It was something personal!

42
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,690
I don't have to answer you!

43
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,690
What about you, Ms. Hanasaki?

44
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,790
I was the kitchen making preparations for the evening

45
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,390
and taking care of the guests here.

46
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,590
How about you, Mr. Ryoichi?

47
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,290
I was going in and out of the guestroom.

48
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,390
I heard that the master burned your precious fishing rod?

49
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,290
Well, you see...

50
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,290
Tell us about what really happened.

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,790
I was told to attend the tea ceremony tonight.

52
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,490
It seemed that he wanted to announce me becoming his successor

53
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,590
at the ceremony.

54
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,290
But you don't know a thing about the practice of tea!

55
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,490
No way!

56
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,990
He couldn't have possibly said something like that!

57
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,190
So, did you accept the offer?

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,490
No way! I refused!

59
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,890
In other words, the master burned your fishing rod

60
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,190
because you wouldn't listen to him?

61
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,890
And you hated him because of that?

62
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,790
Wait a second.

63
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,390
Officer Yokomizo, when the master was died,

64
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,690
everyone including Ryoichi was here in this room.

65
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,090
Exactly.

66
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,590
If in fact someone did go over to kill him,

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,390
as you can see, we would've witnessed it from the veranda.

68
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,890
I was sitting on that chair all the while,

69
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,990
and no one was seen going to the tea room.

70
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,590
Which means everyone has a perfect alibi.

71
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,990
I wonder about what Ms. Mimura brought in when she returned.

72
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,890
She looked to be concerned about people seeing her.

73
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,490
But she couldn't possibly had time to hide anything.

74
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,690
Which means...

75
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,490
Could that be it?

76
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,990
I knew it. Just as I thought!

77
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,090
Could I please have a glass of water?

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,990
I'm sorry, I'm so thirsty.

79
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,290
Here you go.

80
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,490
Thank you so much.

81
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,590
I'll make some tea for everyone else right now.

82
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,190
Excuse me, Ms. Hanasaki.

83
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,690
Yes, sonny?

84
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,090
Why doesn't Mr. Ryoichi want to succeed the master

85
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,190
despite being an only child?

86
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,490
That's...

87
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,090
Keep out of this, kid!

88
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,590
But that's true. Why?

89
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,990
I didn't want to become like my father.

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,590
Father was so haughty

91
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,990
that mother was always crying in sadness.

92
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,290
But isn't it only natural for a father to want his son

93
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,090
to take over the seat of the successor

94
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,790
that has been handed down for generations?

95
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,390
Becoming a master means giving speeches and lectures.

96
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,690
The pay is really good, and you get to own tea bowls

97
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,090
that have been handed down for generations.

98
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,190
That's all father was ever interested in!

99
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,690
So, if he passes the seat onto you,

100
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,490
he can go on living the way he has up to now.

101
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,890
That's what I didn't like about father.

102
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,090
Let me help you, Ms. Hanasaki.

103
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,390
Thank you.

104
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,790
If you don't like him that much, why didn't you leave the house?

105
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,490
Hey!

106
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,790
Right.

107
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,090
Well, I was gone for quite a while actually.

108
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,790
I had him come back

109
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,790
because I was burdened taking care of the master alone.

110
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,090
I see.

111
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,590
I came back on the condition that I would not succeed my father.

112
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,290
He didn't have anyone to manage his money,

113
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,090
so he said I could come back if I handled accounting for him.

114
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,490
He's really greedy, you know.

115
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,290
But he asked you to be his successor again.

116
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,690
Accounting?

117
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,390
Then, you know how much money and assets

118
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,290
the Aonogi family has, don't you?

119
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,290
Hey!

120
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,490
Is he right?

121
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,490
In the event your father dies before his successor is decided on,

122
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,490
you will inherit all his assets, right?

123
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,590
Not to mention that

124
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,590
the seat of the master is free for you to do as you please.

125
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,590
What was your real reason for coming back home?

126
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,990
How rude!

127
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,690
Master had health problems!

128
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,290
Why else would he came back

129
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,290
if it's not because of he's worried about his father?

130
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,190
It's okay. Thank you, Ms. Hanasaki.

131
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,390
I'm going to go and serve this, then.

132
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,590
So, the master who was afraid of the monster of the pond

133
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,490
stayed confined in the tea room

134
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,490
where there's talismans were posted everywhere.

135
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,090
Moreover, he hated it when anyone comes near the room.

136
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,590
Yes, he even had an alarm set up to keep intruders away.

137
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,890
Which means that

138
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,190
it would be difficult for an outsider to come in.

139
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,290
Right.

140
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,890
On top of that, the tea room is surrounded by the pond.

141
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,990
If anyone were to go by the only corridor there us here,

142
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,990
somebody would've seen it.

143
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,090
How did the killer do it?

144
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,990
What's with you?

145
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,490
I'll bet you were deceiving the master by offering him expensive bowls,

146
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,490
but let me tell you, he isn't dumb!

147
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,990
Speak for yourself!

148
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,890
I heard you invested so much money

149
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,290
to the point of running your company bankrupt!

150
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,990
Hold on a minute please!

151
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,190
All I'm asking is about your relationship with the master.

152
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,790
Huh? What's with this tea cup?

153
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,690
Ms. Hanasaki! There's a crack in this cup.

154
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,290
I'm very sorry.

155
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,790
I'll bet that all you're concerned about is how it looks on the outside

156
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,990
and don't care about how it looks on the inside!

157
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,390
Care only about how it looks like on the outside?

158
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,990
Now, now. I'm sure she's upset after what happened.

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,490
I wonder?

160
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,990
Ms. Hanasaki, I'll bet you're glad that the master's dead.

161
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,390
After all, he's the one who lead his wife

162
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,690
who was taking such good care of you to her death.

163
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,990
I would never!

164
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,490
Ms. Hanasaki has been taking good care of father.

165
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,790
Oh, my! For all I know, I'll bet you both

166
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,990
drove master to commit suicide with all your talks about the monster.

167
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,090
-What? -How absurd!

168
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,490
Ms. Hanasaki!

169
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,090
Ms. Hanasaki.

170
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,490
How dare she say that I hated him.

171
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,990
Don't let her bother you.

172
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,090
Like you already know, she's always like that.

173
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,390
Is she the master's wife?

174
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,490
She looks very kind.

175
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,090
She really was kind.

176
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,490
Just by looking at her picture comforts me.

177
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,290
That's why I have so many pictures of her here.

178
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,190
She never got down on me for not liking tea ceremony.

179
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,690
She used to keep company fishing, too.

180
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,290
The way this rope was tied...

181
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,190
There! Somebody forced their way here.

182
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,590
If my deduction is correct...

183
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,790
Just as I thought.

184
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,490
Which means the killer must be the person

185
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,690
who was acting at the time the corpse was found.

186
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,090
There must be some evidence that the killer left behind.

187
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,090
That's...

188
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,790
I've found unmovable evidence!

189
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,190
Thank you so much, everyone.

190
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,990
Okay, so I get to go home.

191
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,690
Yes, since there is no doubt it was suicide.

192
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,890
-Oh, no! -Goodness.

193
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,790
Oh, Conan. We're going home.

194
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,390
Where's Pops?

195
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,490
He'll be down right now.

196
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,490
Okay!

197
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,890
So, it's over.

198
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,190
All right, time to head home.

199
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,090
Sure, after you take a nap first, though.

200
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,980
All we have to do now is wait for the coroner's report.

201
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,380
Officer!

203
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,280
Pops is saying, "Don't tell me they're leaving

204
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,880
with the killer right before their eyes!"

205
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,480
The killer?

206
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Dad figured it out!

207
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,180
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

208
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,780
You actually already know, don't you,

209
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,180
Officer Yokomizo?

210
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,080
That the master didn't commit suicide,

211
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,180
but was killed.

212
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,780
Please give me the details.

213
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,980
Well, I'm sure glad that we have a famous detective around!

214
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,280
At least, we're spared being bored.

215
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,880
I guess I'll explain it briefly, then.

216
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,080
About the time when the pond turned crimson in color,

217
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,780
the killing took place without anyone noticing.

218
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,580
However, when the master's body was found,

219
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,980
you were all in this room, right?

220
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,680
Yes, the killer tied the master

221
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,080
inside the tea room onto a beam

222
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,080
while staying in this room using one rope!

223
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,580
What?

224
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,680
With one rope?

225
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,480
The killer following the account of the monster story

226
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,880
about this pond that had been carried down for generations,

227
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,980
and slashed the master on the porch of the tea room.

228
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,180
Then, the master was strangled to death

229
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,580
with a rope wrapped around his neck from behind.

230
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,180
The killer tied the rope that was hidden somewhere

231
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,880
in the tea room to a beam.

232
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,780
A special knot was tied so that if one side was pulled on,

233
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,180
the loop of the rope would get smaller

234
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,680
with one end was wrapped around the master's neck,

235
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,180
and the other end was tied to the support of the beam.

236
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,780
The rope was then passed through the window on the outside.

237
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,880
The rope was tied onto the stick of the windmill beforehand

238
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,980
and sunk way deep in the water of the pond.

239
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,080
The rope was then tied onto the end of the rope

240
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,180
that was drawn outside from inside.

241
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,980
This is how the rope was rigged.

242
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,780
Finally, a spring is made by using the removable wood

243
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,780
by the miniature entrance, a thumbtack and a rubber band.

244
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,980
The locked door trick is set up by supporting the door

245
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,980
with the hanging scroll,

246
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,180
which after the killer leaves.

247
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,180
Come to think of it, there seemed to be something

248
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,380
that looked to be a needle hole on the door.

249
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,280
What?

250
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,380
The killer came back to this room after all that was done,

251
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,480
and created an alibi.

252
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,980
Oh, my God! Really?

253
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,980
The pond turns crimson just about 4pm

254
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,380
and the timer starts the windmill spinning automatically.

255
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,380
Then, the rope is wound by the stick of the windmill

256
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,280
and the corpse is pulled into the room.

257
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,080
The hanging scroll bumps into the body which falls,

258
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,380
and the door completely falls.

259
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,580
The removable wood locks into the hole in the pillar.

260
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,780
After the rope pulls the body up to the beam,

261
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,480
the loop is closed tightly.

262
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,780
The part of the rope that had been measured beforehand

263
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,880
and partly severed was cuts off completely,

264
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,580
and were pulled by the windmill and goes outside.

265
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,980
All that needed to be done after that was deliberately

266
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,780
make it look like the door was being moved to the side

267
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,880
while we were all shocked at finding the corpse,

268
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,280
and remove the thumbtack and rubber band.

269
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,780
I see.

270
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,480
If so, the crime could've been committed.

271
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
At about the time the windmill begins spinning,

272
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,680
the sunshine from the west

273
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,780
diffuses reflection on the surface of the water,

274
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,980
making the rope difficult to see.

275
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,880
The killer used this characteristic to commit the crime.

276
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,580
But how did the killer made it to the tea room?

277
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,980
By using the joining corridor that we were looking at.

278
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,280
Wasn't it you that just testified

279
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,480
that nobody was seen going to the tea room?

280
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
But you were the one who said,

281
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,580
"All you're concerned about is how it looks on the outside,

282
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,480
and don't care how it looks on the inside."

283
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,180
Isn't that right?

284
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,480
What? Yes.

285
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,580
You're right.

286
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,980
The killer used that blind spot,

287
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,180
leaving us looking at the pond

288
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,880
while walking right before our eyes

289
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,580
under the joining corridor.

290
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,680
What?

291
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,280
The killer first snuck under the joining corridor

292
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,680
from the bushes beside the corridor.

293
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Then, he swam all the way to the tea room.

294
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,980
After that, he came up in front of the entrance door on the veranda.

295
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,380
After luring the master out,

296
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,780
the killer slashed him with the knife.

297
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,180
So, Mr. Mouri, just who is the killer?

298
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
The killer acted strange

299
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,380
during the time the crime was being committed.

300
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,280
Ms. Mimura, it's you, isn't it?

301
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,080
You said you were going out, but...

302
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
What's with you?

303
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,680
Are you saying that I'm the one who killed the master?

304
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,880
So, I take it you will explain where you went now?

305
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,480
I just went to pick this up!

306
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,680
Isn't that an expensive bowl?

307
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,880
How did you know?

308
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,180
After knowing that the master

309
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,480
was going to retire after the tea ceremony tonight,

310
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,580
weren't you afraid that Mr. Yagura

311
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,580
would get the seat as his successor?

312
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,280
That's why you went out to go and get yourself a bowl

313
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,780
that was even more expensive than that Mr. Yagura brought.

314
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,080
Isn't that right, Ms. Mimura?

315
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,580
Because if I inherit the master,

316
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,080
most of his asset would become mine.

317
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,680
I just got a bit greedy.

318
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm sure you're telling the truth.

319
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,880
If you go out and sneak back in,

320
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,280
the security alarm would go off.

321
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,680
When Ms. Mimura actually returned,

322
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,980
Ms. Hanasaki went to greet her at the door.

323
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,780
Unfortunately, she had no time to go near the tea room.

324
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,480
Which means Ms. Mimura is not the killer.

325
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,780
Then, who killed the master?

326
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,680
The killer, after having calculated that the master

327
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,580
wanting to put on a grand performance,

328
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,880
would not let anyone near the tea room

329
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,780
hung the master by the neck tying the rope in a special way.

330
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,280
It is a method of rope tying that the fishermen use

331
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,680
when they want to anchor the boat in place.

332
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,580
Fisherman?

333
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,680
I didn't do it!

334
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,880
No, it's not you.

335
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,280
The killer swam across the corridor.

336
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,880
I see!

337
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,080
The killer had to be drenched! His hair, body and all!

338
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,580
In order to hide this fact, the killer had to take a bath

339
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,080
right after he committed the crime.

340
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,280
That's right.

341
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,980
The killer is you, Mr. Yagura!

342
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,980
When everyone was gathered in this room,

343
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,180
you criticized Ms. Mimura's behavior severely, right?

344
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,780
I had to go between both of you and stop you.

345
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,380
You did that because you didn't us to notice

346
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,980
that the master being pulled up, didn't you?

347
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,580
No wonder you were so enraged.

348
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,680
All you had to do after that

349
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,680
was wait for someone to notices the master's body.

350
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,780
It's all a lie!

351
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,380
You're assuming everything with no proof at all!

352
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,880
No use trying to deceive us at this point.

353
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,780
You've left evidence behind for all of us to see.

354
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,080
In the joining corridor to the tea room.

355
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Mr. Mouri, I've found what you asked me to look for!

356
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,180
What is it?

357
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,680
The thing that was found on the beams

358
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,480
under the joining corridor.

359
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
What?

360
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,680
It's a handprint.

361
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,980
And this black thing is...

362
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,780
It's the moss in the pond.

363
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,480
If he passed by there,

364
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
I figured it had to be stuck somewhere.

365
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,080
There are many traces of the handprint

366
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,780
and I'm sure we can distinguish the fingerprints from it, too.

367
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,380
The officers of the criminal investigation section

368
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,680
are checking on it now.

369
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,780
I hate to be rude,

370
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,980
but will you let me take your fingerprints, Mr. Yagura?

371
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,080
I thought the whole plan was perfect.

372
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,980
So, you admit it?

373
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,280
That guy was the worse!

374
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,780
I'll bet he told you

375
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,680
that he'd let you inherit his seat and were all for it.

376
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,380
No!

377
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,280
I was making fake pieces of expensive pottery

378
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,480
together with him and selling them off.

379
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,580
No way.

380
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,980
I'll bet you didn't know, did you?

381
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,380
We've been at it for the last 10 years.

382
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,280
However, after the death of his wife,

383
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,380
he started believing the existence of the monster,

384
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,380
and his entire personality changed.

385
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,180
He said he would let Ryoichi inherit everything

386
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,880
and publicize what took place.

387
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
So, you had no choice but to kill him

388
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,780
before he made everything public.

389
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,680
He shouldn't have made that tea room.

390
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,180
Look! It's happening as legend has it, didn't it?

391
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,080
It's already night time.

392
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,680
I can drive you over to a station

393
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,780
or a hot spring if you like.

394
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,580
I'd really appreciate that!

395
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,380
Although he may have made it look like it goes with the legend,

396
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,580
I'm beginning to think

397
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,180
that there may actually be a monster.

398
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,080
Well, since it happened long ago,

399
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,080
there may have been a gigantic serpent at least?

400
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,280
But it's not a big deal.

401
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,480
If it comes squirming out,

402
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,780
all we have to do is catch it and shed its skin.

403
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,280
What's wrong with you guys?

404
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
-That... -That...

405
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,980
It's a serpent!

406
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,380
Hey, I thought you said it was no big deal?

407
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,340
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,240
"Hunter"

409
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,380
In the next episode, the Youth Detective Squad goes all out.

410
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
Conan, I'm counting on you as to the next episode.

411
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay!
