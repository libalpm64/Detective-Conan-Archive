1
00:00:01,427 --> 00:00:03,027
"We're having barbecue today"

2
00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:05,227
"Barbecue from afternoon"

3
00:00:05,227 --> 00:00:10,627
"While we're at it, we're having barbecue for dinner too"

4
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:15,227
Come, come. We're only invited over for lunch, you know!

5
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:17,227
But, how lucky we are

6
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,227
to be invited to have barbecue together

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,027
from a couple we met at camp!

8
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:23,727
Yep! Since they said they forgot to bring rice,

9
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,927
all we did was share some of the rice that we had with them!

10
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:30,927
Well, it's also thanks to someone who got kidnapped too, though.

11
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:34,527
If the day we decided to camp wasn't shifted because of that incident,

12
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:36,827
we wouldn't have met that couple either, you see.

13
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,727
It couldn't be helped, could it?

14
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:41,127
Because on the Sunday after the incident,

15
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:44,227
we were interrogated for so long.

16
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:48,627
But why'd you come along with everybody back then?

17
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,927
You should've let dangerous things like that

18
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,727
up to Doc and Subaru.

19
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:55,827
Because Subaru told me to come along.

20
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:59,427
Besides, I couldn't stand just being there without doing anything.

21
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,627
Huh?

22
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,527
I figured that if I just stayed back home,

23
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,927
I would miss out at seeing the end of you.

24
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:08,227
Is that so?

25
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:15,627
But it sure is strange.

26
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:16,827
What is?

27
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:21,027
It's the first time you're calling him Subaru, isn't it?

28
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:23,127
So, you finally got used to him, eh?

29
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:26,927
Wipe that look off your face.

30
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:30,627
I won't let her get away.

31
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,127
It's not... anything like that.

32
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,027
Yes. Hello?

33
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:45,127
Yahoo! Conan, how are you?

34
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:49,027
Yeah, I guess so.

35
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:52,027
What's with that low reaction of yours?

36
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,827
I rescued you from a bad lady the other day, didn't I?

37
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,227
Yeah.

38
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,827
Go for it!

39
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,927
I'm glad! You're okay!

40
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,827
I guess so.

41
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,827
Thank you for everything back then.

42
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,427
Who is it, on the phone?

43
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:14,027
Oh, no.

44
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:17,627
That voice... Is it that girl named Haibara?

45
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,327
Conan, who are you talking with?

46
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,427
If it's from Ran, will you give me the phone when you're done?

47
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,727
Which voice are you talking about?

48
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,227
Who cares!

49
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:28,027
We finished school early

50
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:30,227
so we're heading over to the detective agency now.

51
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,927
If it's okay with you, why don't you bring her along too?

52
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,027
I'm going to be having barbecue from now today,

53
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:36,627
so I won't be there even if you come over.

54
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:39,127
Bye.

55
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:42,627
Hey, what's this barbecue thing about?

56
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,727
He hung up.

57
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,627
Come to think of it, Conan was saying that

58
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,227
he was invited over to have barbecue with the others.

59
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:51,927
Why didn't you say that earlier?

60
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,027
Sorry.

61
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,227
What' s this? Don't tell me you came over to Ran's

62
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:58,727
because you wanted to see that glasses brat?

63
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,227
Well...

64
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:05,127
I actually wanted to see Amuro, Kogoro's disciple too.

65
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:08,827
I see. Back then, it was dark in the middle of the road

66
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:12,327
and at the police station we were interrogated in different rooms, too.

67
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,927
Maybe they have mutual feelings for each other.

68
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:19,327
By the way, have you guys met that girl called Haibara?

69
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,627
Yep. You mean Ai, right?

70
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,027
I don't take too well to her.

71
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:25,127
What kind of girl is she?

72
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,927
She a little different, but she's cute.

73
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:31,427
I guess you could say that a not too friendly grown up woman,

74
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:34,927
shrunk and turned into a child.

75
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,927
A grown up woman?

76
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:40,827
Yep! She sometimes says things that sound really grown up.

77
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:41,827
Right, right.

78
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:45,727
Sometimes, she really resembles that glasses brat.

79
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:49,327
But Ai doesn't seem to be a Holmes freak or anything like that.

80
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,027
Masumi, I guess you just met Conan,

81
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:53,627
so you don't know much about him

82
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:57,527
but, Conan, like Shinichi loves Holmes.

83
00:03:57,527 --> 00:04:01,327
I know it from way long ago.

84
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:05,027
The vivid colored memories of summer

85
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,227
solve mysteries all season round.

86
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,027
Something only we witnessed.

87
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,927
A husband and wife fight because of a misunderstanding.

88
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:12,627
He sees through the one and only truth.

89
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,727
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

90
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,127
His name is Detective Conan!

91
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:04,023
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 1)"

92
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:13,624
Strange.

93
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,323
We've come here on time, and yet...

94
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:21,323
Happy Halloween!

95
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:26,823
Halloween has long gone, already.

96
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,524
I mean, usually during Halloween,

97
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,823
the children who visit the houses are the ones who disguise themselves.

98
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,924
-Right. -Yep.

99
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:37,224
That's why I told you not to, because it won't work.

100
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:42,224
What? I thought the children would like it.

101
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:45,724
You used to always take things too far from before.

102
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:48,024
Even at last year's Christmas party,

103
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:50,323
you wore a reindeer outfit.

104
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:53,124
That's because you told me not to wear the mini-skirt Santa outfit

105
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,823
because it was embarrassing, right?

106
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:57,023
Think of how old you are!

107
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,924
Well, I'm sorry I'm a middle aged lady!

108
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,523
Come, come, you two...

109
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,523
This is delicious!

110
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:09,523
This meat is really good!

111
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,823
You'd better eat vegetables too,

112
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:12,823
to eat a nutritious meal!

113
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,023
Okay!

114
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:16,424
You too, Doc.

115
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,823
Leave me alone.

116
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:22,424
Eating together with the children is a lot of run after all.

117
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:24,624
If you will excuse me asking, do you have any children?

118
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,224
None.

119
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:29,224
Although it's been 10 years since we've gotten married.

120
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:31,124
Only if we had children,

121
00:07:31,124 --> 00:07:34,323
I guess my husband would've stopped flirting.

122
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,024
Huh?

123
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,624
Well...

124
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,823
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:42,524
It's not something I should say in front of children.

126
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:45,823
-No. -Hey, Sumika!

127
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,823
Do you know where my cell phone is?

128
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:49,524
No, I don't!

129
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:52,524
Maybe you have it in the pocket of your coat?

130
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:55,323
It's not there.

131
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:58,124
I'm supposed to receive mail from my superior at the company.

132
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:01,823
Don't tell me you forgot it again at the cabaret.

133
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:04,023
I'm not going to go pick it up for you again!

134
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,924
It can't be helped, can it?

135
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:08,924
Back then, I got a call from the shop to my office

136
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:11,023
and I was working, so...

137
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,724
Or rather, back then, you looked at the contents of my cell phone

138
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,823
-and did something, right? -Yes!

139
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:19,023
I sent mail after mail to all the girls

140
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,823
that were sending you suspicious mails!

141
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:23,224
"Die, you thief" I wrote!

142
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:26,023
I was wondering why I suddenly stopped getting mail,

143
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,924
but it was you after all!

144
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,624
So what? Your flirting is to blame for everything!

145
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,024
What?

146
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:36,823
Thinking that a jealous monster wife like you is waiting at home

147
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,223
make me want to flirt the more!

148
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:41,524
What? You come home late recently

149
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:44,524
because you're meeting some woman, after all?

150
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,124
Excuse me.

151
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:54,524
I'm sorry. This is nothing unusual.

152
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:55,724
Don't let us bother you.

153
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:58,124
I've been irritated recently, you see.

154
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:01,424
At any rate, won't you help me look for my cell phone?

155
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:03,224
The Department Head gets angry

156
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:04,324
if I don't return his mails right away.

157
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,624
Are you really sure that

158
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:07,024
you're waiting for mail from the department head?

159
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,924
Yeah!

160
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,424
It's the usual mahjong game he wants me to join.

161
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,824
Call my cell phone from yours.

162
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,424
I'll look for it, listening to the ringtone.

163
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:19,424
But I can't find my cell phone from this morning either.

164
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,924
I'm sure it's somewhere in the living room, though.

165
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,324
I wonder if they'll be okay? Those two...

166
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,624
I guess.

167
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:29,524
Like they say, a spat is evidence that they get along.

168
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,624
Even a dog won't involve itself in an argument

169
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:34,624
between husband and wife.

170
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,624
Genta, you sure can eat.

171
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:39,324
Aye! Because I'm not a dog!

172
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,924
Huh? You're leaving?

173
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:43,924
Yeah.

174
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:47,024
Why don't you drop by because you came all this way?

175
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,424
I just remembered I had something to do.

176
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:54,024
Besides, it seems like Kogoro's disciple is off today, too.

177
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:56,024
Don't tell me that you're saying

178
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,624
you're going home because the glasses brat isn't here?

179
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,424
No, no.

180
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:04,924
I really remembered something that I have to do.

181
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,924
But, to make up for this, the next time I come,

182
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,424
I'll have you show me albums

183
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:10,324
and tell me a lot of stuff I want to know!

184
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,224
About your boyfriend too, okay?

185
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:14,924
What?

186
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:19,724
You're really cheerful through and through!

187
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,024
Really?

188
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:24,724
Well, long time ago, there was this person that never laughed,

189
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,924
and I turned out this way

190
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,524
because I kept trying to make that person laugh.

191
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,024
Hey!

192
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,324
What? What is it?

193
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:48,824
What's the matter? Running off all of a sudden?

194
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,124
An acquaintance of mine...

195
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,924
I thought I saw somebody I knew.

196
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:54,624
An acquaintance?

197
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,024
Not possible.

198
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,124
I sure did eat.

199
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:15,024
I'm really full!

200
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:16,724
Are you taking a picture of Genta?

201
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,624
Yes, I'm going to make a diary of Genta's growth!

202
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:22,624
To show that this is how he became like Doc.

203
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,324
Hey, hey.

204
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:29,024
He's already quite close to Doc, I think.

205
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,624
A cell phone!

206
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:38,224
Isn't that the cell phone the couple was looking for a while ago?

207
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,824
Then, I'll go give this to them!

208
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:46,224
Yeah, I'm sure they're still in that living room.

209
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:48,124
Okay.

210
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,024
Excuse me, I found your phone...

211
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:59,824
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

212
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,124
I'm gonna kill you!

213
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:04,024
Hey, Sumika.

214
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,724
Cool it.

215
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,924
Sumika.

216
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,224
Die!

217
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:18,024
Bad... bad news!

218
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:20,724
Those two are at it again!

219
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:23,724
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

220
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:26,324
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

221
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:27,724
she's going to kill him.

222
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,524
-What? -What?

223
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:37,224
We've got to stop them, quick!

224
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,728
Mrs. Konno? Mrs. Konno?

225
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,328
Please open your eyes! Mrs. Konno!

226
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,128
Please get a hold of yourself!

227
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,828
She's still breathing.

228
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:06,728
Her complexion is pale and her pulse is barely detectable.

229
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:10,128
She's bleeding badly and her blood pressure's low.

230
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:12,628
Hey, Conan.

231
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,328
This thing that's poked inside,

232
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,128
isn't it better to pull it out?

233
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,128
-Don't touch the knife! -Huh?

234
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:20,328
If you pull that out, her wound will open

235
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,328
-and she'll bleed to death! -What?

236
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:24,628
Ai! Is the ambulance here yet?

237
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:27,128
They'll be here in about 10 minutes!

238
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:28,128
Okay!

239
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:31,828
Mr. Konno, do you have any cushions and blankets?

240
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:34,328
Hey! Cushions and blankets!

241
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:36,928
Gosh.

242
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:38,628
Doc and Ayumi, go get the cushions!

243
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:41,428
Mitsuhiko, you go look for the blanket and bring it over!

244
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:44,028
-Okay. -All right!

245
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:53,228
She's wearing only an apron and sweater.

246
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,128
She's dressed so lightly.

247
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:58,628
Even her pants are short Sabrina pants.

248
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,228
Hey, Conan. Do you need water or something?

249
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:02,328
No.

250
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:04,428
More than that, that's the kitchen over there, right?

251
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,928
Can you go get me a plastic bag if there are any?

252
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:10,528
-She may throw up. -Okay.

253
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,128
Here're the cushions!

254
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:15,628
Place it under her feet to raise them!

255
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:16,728
Yeah.

256
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,728
That'll decrease the blood flow to the legs

257
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:22,428
and increase the blood circulation around her heart area!

258
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,228
Okay!

259
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:26,528
What should I do with the blanket?

260
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:29,528
Cover her from her chest where the knife is stabbed to below.

261
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:32,528
That'll prevent her temperature from going down due to shock!

262
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:34,528
-Yes! -Now, all we need is

263
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,428
her blood type and history of past allergies,

264
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:40,428
while we wait for the ambulance to get here.

265
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:43,328
But, with her husband in that state...

266
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:48,728
You...

267
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:51,028
I know you're spaced out because you unfortunately,

268
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:52,528
accidentally stabbed your wife and is in shock,

269
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:55,428
at least tell us your wife's blood type and allergy history!

270
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,628
You're husband and wife

271
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,228
who promised eternal love to each other, right?

272
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:06,228
Sumika!

273
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,528
She has no allergies.

274
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,828
Her blood type is AB,

275
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,228
RH minus.

276
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:17,328
RH minus, blood type AB?

277
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:19,928
There are only 1 in 2000 people!

278
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:22,528
Ai! We'd better let the hospital know about this right away!

279
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,628
They probably won't have any blood in stock!

280
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:25,728
All right.

281
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:29,028
It's not that they don't have any at all.

282
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:35,028
I'm also RH minus, blood type AB too, you see.

283
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:42,828
Although I sort of have a rough idea,

284
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:45,528
would you give me the details

285
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,528
of why you stabbed your wife?

286
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,428
Like I told the person at the hospital a while ago,

287
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,828
what triggered the whole thing was my cell phone.

288
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,328
-What? -Well, you see, back then...

289
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,428
remember, I was looking for it? My cell phone.

290
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,028
I found it under the sofa of the living room.

291
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:08,328
And the mail from the Department Head asking me

292
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,228
to play mahjong with him hadn't come yet,

293
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,028
so I was going to call him

294
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:13,728
and ask whether the game was on for tonight,

295
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:17,028
but my wife took the cell phone away from me,

296
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:19,528
saying that she wanted to call her cell phone first,

297
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,228
so that she could ring it and look for it.

298
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,628
We found that cell phone.

299
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,928
-Right, Ayumi? -Yep.

300
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:29,328
So, I went to deliver it to you.

301
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,828
Is that why you got into a fight?

302
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,228
No.

303
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:37,228
The fight started after my wife rang her cell phone.

304
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,328
Hey, what's with this woman?

305
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:44,028
A number for a new woman's been added again!

306
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:45,528
Again?

307
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:46,928
Don't tell me that

308
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:49,728
you've been looking through my cell phone without telling me?

309
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:51,128
Of course!

310
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:54,028
It's the job of a wife to supervise her husband!

311
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,828
I've been checking it every night after you went to bed!

312
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:58,128
Hey, hey.

313
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:01,428
Privacy exists even between husband and wife, you know!

314
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:04,528
What a woman. I shouldn't have married you.

315
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,528
You took the words right out of my mouth!

316
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,328
And that's when my wife with knife in hand

317
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:13,528
said that she'd kill me and charged forward to stab me.

318
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:17,728
While I was struggling with her, I felt her go weak,

319
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:18,928
and before I knew what was happening,

320
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:21,828
I saw the knife poked into her chest.

321
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,128
Is that what happened, Ayumi?

322
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,228
Yep.

323
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:27,028
But all I saw was

324
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:32,328
Mrs. Konno holding the knife saying, "I'm not forgiving you."

325
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,828
I see.

326
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:37,128
Well, I guess it was in self-defense.

327
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:38,328
But it's amazing how you two

328
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:41,028
continued to be a couple the way you were.

329
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,528
She changed. My wife.

330
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,628
When I met her in front of the mobile blood donation center,

331
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:52,228
she used to be a kind woman who laughed a lot.

332
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,428
We sure run into each other a lot, don't we?

333
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:58,228
Really. We mutually have valuable blood types.

334
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:02,728
But recently, she's been constantly irritated.

335
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,228
Even after she comes home from work,

336
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:06,828
all she says is, "I'm fatigued, tired, sleepy."

337
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:09,528
And doesn't even make dinner.

338
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:12,728
When I decide to cook for her at times so she can take it easy,

339
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:16,428
she throws up as if to say that she can't eat the food I make.

340
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,828
I invited her to go camping where we used to go to a lot,

341
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:21,528
before we got married for a change,

342
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:23,128
but we get into a big fight

343
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:24,628
when she finds out that I forgot to bring the rice.

344
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:28,628
But, back then, thanks to all of you sharing the rice with us,

345
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:31,028
my wife became cheerful again.

346
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,328
But honestly, I couldn't stand it anymore.

347
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:39,528
But I like Mrs. Konno!

348
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:43,328
She wore the Halloween costume to entertain us,

349
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:46,428
and she was all smiles when making barbecue, too.

350
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:52,328
I don't want Mrs. Konno to die!

351
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,428
Wipe that look off your face.

352
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:58,328
I know she'll make it through.

353
00:18:58,328 --> 00:18:59,628
Yep.

354
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:02,228
Wipe that look off your face.

355
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:06,828
I won't let her get away.

356
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:13,528
Wipe that look off your face.

357
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,428
I'll protect you over my dead body.

358
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,628
Dai Moroboshi.

359
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:22,328
My older sister's boyfriend, who betrayed the Organization.

360
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:27,628
But, if that lady makes it,

361
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,628
it's probably thanks to us who came here, right?

362
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,628
Yes, I guess so.

363
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,528
If back then, the cell phone wasn't found

364
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,928
and Ayumi didn't go to give it to him,

365
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,328
we wouldn't have realized that the two were fighting

366
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:42,928
and maybe it would've been too late to save her.

367
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:54,228
Something just doesn't seem right.

368
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,628
Everything's moving too smoothly.

369
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,928
Like something's being manipulated.

370
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:05,128
But, what on earth is it?

371
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:28,628
"Surgery in progress"

372
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,728
It's sure taking a long time.

373
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,528
Don't worry! I'm sure she'll be fine.

374
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:40,128
Yep.

375
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:45,328
Oh, mail.

376
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:48,928
That's Mrs. Konno's cell phone that we found a while ago, right?

377
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,528
-Yep. -Let me see it.

378
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:58,428
No, you shouldn't read other people's mail without permission.

379
00:21:58,428 --> 00:21:59,928
About you not feeling too well

380
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:02,028
that you asked me for advice about last time...

381
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:05,128
I suggest you go to see a doctor.

382
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,928
A heart mark at the end of the sentence?

383
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,928
Why a heart mark when she's asking for advice on not feeling well?

384
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:13,328
Why?

385
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:17,128
Hey, Conan.

386
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,828
Are you going to check the mails she sent out too?

387
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:23,728
This is...

388
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,128
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

389
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:28,928
The husband was saying that his wife sent mails saying, "Die, thief"

390
00:22:28,928 --> 00:22:32,428
to the women that sent him suspicious mails, right?

391
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:35,828
Yes, but there's nothing like that here.

392
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:37,728
It does seem that she was irritated

393
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:40,528
because she wasn't feeling good, though.

394
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:44,528
I see! That's why that cup was over there!

395
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:48,028
She wasn't feeling good, that is, she was feeling sick, right?

396
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:51,228
It looked like the lady was about to drink medicine.

397
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:55,228
Because I found a glass cup with water inside in the kitchen!

398
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:58,028
Glass cup with water?

399
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,628
Then, did you find medicine nearby too?

400
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:04,628
No. The only other thing there was a sugar container.

401
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:10,228
I was about to bring that water to the lady, but...

402
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:15,728
Are you all right, Genta?

403
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,428
Maybe you're the one who needs medicine, Genta.

404
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:21,828
Could it be that you have a cold?

405
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:25,928
No. My nose feels ticklish.

406
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:28,328
I can't stop...

407
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:31,928
Then, why don't you try holding the space below your nose

408
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:34,128
with your index finger and blocking off your nostrils?

409
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:36,028
Like this?

410
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:40,028
If that doesn't work, pinch your nose.

411
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:41,228
It stopped!

412
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:44,528
Well, it's something like a lucky spell.

413
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,228
Lucky spell...

414
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,328
Don't tell me it's...

415
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:55,728
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

416
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,760
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,900
"Water in the cup"

418
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,020
The fight between husband and wife is really tough.

419
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,360
Like distasteful dog food, maybe.

420
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,400
That even dogs wouldn't want to get a taste of.
Like distasteful dog food, maybe.

421
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
That even dogs wouldn't want to get a taste of.
