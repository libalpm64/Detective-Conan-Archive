1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,020
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,820
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,320
Today's episode is the 300th.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,520
We want to show our appreciation to our fans

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,520
with a touching solution.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,120
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,920
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,220
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,840
Kogoro, Ran and I travel to the Kanmon Strait

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,740
which connects Honshu and Kyushu,

11
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,740
we meet a group of four former high school classmates there.

12
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,340
The next day, another classmate,

13
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,940
Seiji Hario is found dead.

14
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,540
The police suspect the four at first

15
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,640
but their alibis check out

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,340
and they are cleared.

17
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,540
But...

18
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,440
I've got it.

19
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,040
I know how to break their alibis now.

20

"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 2)"

21
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,040
"Shimonoseki Central Police Station"

22
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,640
Something's bothering me though.

23
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,240
What is it?

24
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,340
Hey listen, that surveillance camera you mentioned,

25
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,240
is it the ceiling type?

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,540
You were made a peace sign.

27
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,740
Why you... Stop butting in...

28
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,940
Ceiling type?

29
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,740
Peace.

30

"Human Tunnel (Shimonoseki side) Entrance"

31
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,540
What did you say?

32
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,040
Are you telling me you didn't get a clear look at his face?

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,740
Yeah, the camera's aimed at an angle.

34
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,840
But I'm sure it was him

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,340
because he was wearing the same clothes

36
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,040
in the picture you showed me.

37
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,940
But...

38
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,740
If you didn't see his face,

39
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,740
you don't know for sure it was him.

40
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Conan! When'd you sneak in here?

41
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,740
But Mr. Mouri, what if this man wasn't really Mr. Hario?

42
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,040
Yes. He might have been killed way before this

43
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,840
which means, anyone of those four could have committed the murder.

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,540
"Karato Pier"

45
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,240
I want to apologize for calling you out like this.

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,740
It's alright. But why me?

47
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,840
It's my father's fault.

48
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,940
I think he still suspects you and your friends.

49

"Eiko Nojima (30)"

50
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
I see.

51
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,240
That Seiji Hario was a horrible guy himself, wasn't he?

52
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,340
He was responsible for breaking you and Hondo up

53
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,940
and yet he said he didn't know who Hondo was.

54
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm sure Hondo can't rest in peace.

55
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,640
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,340
No need to apologize.

57
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Pitiful, aren't I?

58
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,740
Calling you out to talk about something like this.

59
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,040
You're in love with someone, aren't you, Ran?

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,340
No. I mean...

61
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,040
I wonder what those people are doing over there?

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,140
That lighthouse is known as "The Lovers' Lighthouse".

63
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,440
The Lovers' Lighthouse?

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,340
When lovers place their hands on the lighthouse together and pray,

65
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,340
they'll be able to overcome any obstacle and be married.

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
Eiko.

67
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,540
Have you been on the ropeway?

68
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,940
The one at Hinoyama.

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
No.

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,540
Why don't we go now?

71
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay.

72
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
"Karato Marketplace"

73
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Yes. No mistake about it.

74
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
Mr. Akitaya got a call right after he got here.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
He got here a little before 11 am, I think.

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,340
And if I remember right, we were talking for about an hour.

77
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,340
I guess Mr. Akitaya was telling us the truth.

78
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,940
So where's this Kaikyokan?

79
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,540
On the other side of the bridge.

80
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,440
It's about a five minute walk from here.

81
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,140
You mean this marketplace where Mr. Akitaya was

82
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,540
and the ferry landing where Mr. Otsubo was

83
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,040
and Kaikyokan where Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,240
were are all within walking distance.

85
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,140
Yes, I remember these two very well.

86
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,240
They were both so pretty,

87
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,640
they called someone from that walkway.

88
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,540
Then they went to watch the performing seal act at 11 am.

89
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,840
So that means...

90
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,140
Excuse me, Miss.

91
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,340
That man you were just talking to sent me here

92
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,340
to ask you something he forgot.

93
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,240
What is it, kid?

94
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,840
The employee over there didn't remember Mr. Otsubo either.

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,740
I knew it.

96
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
But Mr. Mouri,

97
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,240
Akane Isaka and Eiko Nojima saw him get on the 11 o'clock ferry

98
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,040
from over there.

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,140
But Ms. Isaka and Mr. Otsubo are engaged to each other.

100
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,640
But Eiko Nojima claims she saw him too.

101
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,240
That's what I don't understand.

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,440
Conan! Are you still following us around?

103
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,540
I noticed Ms. Nojima only uses her glasses when she's driving.

104
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,140
Glasses?

105
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,340
When she was leaving the police station yesterday,

106
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,040
she put her glasses on when she got in the car.

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,740
What?

108
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,840
When I asked at the aquarium,

109
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,340
they told me she wasn't wearing glasses then.

110
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,640
I guess she only needs them to look at things that are far away.

111
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,340
That's it. They used her.

112
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,040
They used her.

113
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,540
What do you mean?

114
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,540
"Hinoyama Ropeway"

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,140
Is that right?

116
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,540
Yes.

117
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,340
Wow, this is fantastic.

118
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,840
Did you and Hondo come here on your dates?

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,340
Yes.

120
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,040
He and I didn't like crowded places.

121
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,240
The others,

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,740
Akitaya, Otsubo and Akane were always watching over us.

123
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
How nice...

124
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,040
You were all very close, weren't you?

125
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
I can't understand how father can suspect such nice people like you,

126
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,640
he's awful.

127
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,940
I'm the one that's awful.

128
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,840
What was that?

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,340
Are you saying Mr. Akitaya, Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka

130
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,140
worked together and killed Mr. Hario?

131
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,540
That's right.

132
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,940
Then they came up with fool proof alibis using Ms. Nojima.

133
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,040
Are you sure?

134
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,340
The Mr. Otsubo that Ms. Nojima says she saw from here was a fake.

135
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,440
He was an imposter.

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,940
-An imposter. -An imposter. But...

137
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,040
how do you know only the three of them were in on it?

138
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,540
Wouldn't it be logical to assume

139
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,740
that Ms. Nojima was in on it too?

140
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,940
She and Ms. Isaka met in front of this aquarium.

141
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,540
We know it's true because we have witnesses.

142
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,240
If she was in with them,

143
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,340
she and Ms. Isaka would have come here together.

144
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,940
Because that would give them time to work out their plan.

145
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,640
I see what you mean.

146
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,940
Can you get those four together again?

147
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,540
I'll explain everything then.

148
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,940
I'll get right on it.

149
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Yes. Anzai here.

150
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,140
What did you say?

151
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,740
What's wrong?

152
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,840
It seems Ms. Nojima just turned herself in

153
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,740
for the murder of Mr. Hario.

154
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,840
Eiko Nojima?

155
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,040
I don't understand.

156
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,840
This morning, I think it was about 10:00 am.

157
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,040
I went to the hotel Seiji was staying at

158
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,940
and asked to talk to him.

159
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,740
I took him to the area near the Kanmon Bridge.

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,040
To the same place Hondo committed suicide 12 years ago

161
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,240
when his dream was taken away by Hario.

162
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
At that same place,

163
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,240
I asked him

164
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
to apologize to Hondo,

165
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,440
even if it was one just word.

166
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,140
But, he...

167
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,740
just laughed.

168
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,040
He did it to himself, it's all his fault.

169
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,640
Why should I apologize to a piece of trash like him for?

170
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,540
Before I realized what I was doing, I...

171
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,940
He fell slowly then stopped moving.

172
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,740
After she hit him, he fell and then stopped moving?

173
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,540
Then I wonder why...

174
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,240
What made you turn yourself in?

175
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,940
I never imagined Akitaya or the others would be involved in this.

176
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,840
I didn't want to drag them into this on my account.

177
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,340
I still want to talk to the other three.

178
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Mr. Mouri, you still think those three were in on it too, don't you?

179
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,640
There're too many things that can't be explained clearly.

180
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,540
Then why is Ms. Nojima insisting she did it herself?

181
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,140
To protect them.

182
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,440
They're all former classmates,

183
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,540
she probably thinks friendship means she has to protect them.

184
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,240
That's it. That explains everything.

185
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,740
That means...

186
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,940
So a call came in on their cellular

187
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,040
and all of a sudden they got shocked?

188
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,340
Yes. Then they both ran out of here.

189
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,640
I knew it.

190
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,140
Then that person's the only one who could've done it.

191
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,540
Eiko Nojima has confessed that she alone is responsible

192
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,440
for the death of Seiji Hario, but...

193
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,640
I do not believe her.

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,440
Toru Akitaya. Keisuke Otsubo. Akane Isaka.

195
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,140
You three killed him.

196
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
Now wait just a minute.

197
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
Just sit down.

198
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,440
You'll have a chance to talk later.

199
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,140
Mr. Akitaya, you hated Mr. Hario

200
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,140
because of the unexpected and unfair news of your company's buy out.

201
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,440
That was probably your motive.

202
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,340
And Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka,

203
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,140
went along with your plan out of deep friendship.

204
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,940
Slightly past 10 am,

205
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,840
you three called Mr. Hario out

206
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,540
and killed him by the Kanmon Bridge.

207
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,140
Then you worked up very detailed alibis.

208
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,040
Mr. Otsubo dressed himself up as Mr.Hario

209
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,340
and Mr. Akitaya dressed himself up as Mr. Otsubo.

210
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,040
Then Ms. Isaka called Ms. Nojima and asked her to meet her.

211
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,640
At 10:50 am, the two meet in front of Kaikyokan.

212
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,340
Look, it's Otsubo.

213
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,140
Ms. Isaka made Ms. Nojima think

214
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,740
Mr. Otsubo was getting on the 11:00 am ferry.

215
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,640
But, the person on the landing

216
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,440
was actually Mr. Akitaya wearing Mr. Otsubo's clothes.

217
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,140
They used the fact that she had poor eyesight.

218
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,140
Of course Mr. Akitaya never got on that ferry.

219
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,940
He hid Mr. Otsubo's clothes somewhere

220
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,540
then went to the Karato Marketplace for his meeting.

221
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,940
Then at the 11:00 am, the appointed time.

222
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,540
Mr. Otsubo, disguised as Mr. Hario,

223
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
makes the call to Mr. Akitaya.

224
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,240
What do you mean his ghost?

225
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,140
I've heard enough nonsense.

226
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,640
They made it look like Mr. Hario was killed after 11 am

227
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,140
so that they could all have alibis.

228
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,440
Mr. Otsubo disguised himself as Mr. Hario who was already dead

229
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,440
and Mr. Akitaya disguised himself as Mr. Otsubo giving him his alibi.

230
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,340
Ms. Isaka used Ms. Nojima's poor eyesight

231
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,140
to backup Mr. Otsubo's alibi.

232
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,540
And that's how they worked it.

233
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,640
He's wrong.

234
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,040
That's awful. You're all friends,

235
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,340
how could you use Eiko like that?

236
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,940
No, Ran, you're mistaken.

237
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,540
Mr. Mouri, you're wrong.

238
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,640
I killed Hario.

239
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,940
But Ms. Nojima...

240
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,940
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

241
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,140
Is this the Sleeping Kogoro pose I've heard so much about?

242
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,740
But the case's already solved...

243
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,440
90 percent of what I just said is true

244
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,540
but I need to make a few corrections.

245
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,440
Are you trying to say Mr. Akitaya and his friends

246
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,040
weren't in it together?

247
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,840
I thought they were at first

248
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,440
but that turned out to be a mistake.

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,240
-A mistake. -Conan!

250
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,240
A little past 10 this morning,

251
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,640
Ms. Isaka and Mr. Otsubo were shopping in Moji

252
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,940
when Ms. Isaka got a call on her cellular.

253
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,440
The two of them got very shocked and they ran out of the store.

254
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,140
Mr. Otsubo, Ms. Isaka.

255
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,940
That call was from Mr. Akitaya, wasn't it?

256
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,640
He told you Ms. Nojima had killed Mr. Hario, right?

257
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,040
Mr. Akitaya probably went to see Mr. Hario

258
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,240
about his company's buy out.

259
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,940
When he got there,

260
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,740
he saw Ms. Nojima has gotten there first

261
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,340
and was taking him somewhere.

262
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,040
He was worried about her

263
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,740
so he followed them,

264
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,540
that's when he witnessed it.

265
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,840
Mr. Akitaya called you and told you what happened

266
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,140
and when you two found out, you rushed over there.

267
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,140
The three of you then thought you had to do something

268
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,040
to protect Ms. Nojima,

269
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,040
that's when you thought of what I explained earlier.

270
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,040
They did it for me.

271
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,840
Of course. After all, we're all friends, aren't we?

272
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,340
Then who is the murderer?

273
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,140
Like I've been saying from the start, I did it.

274
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,040
Did you hit him twice?

275
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Twice?

276
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,540
There are indications

277
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,940
the victim was struck twice in the back of the head.

278
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,440
That can't be.

279
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,240
I only hit him once.

280
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,740
Ms. Nojima, I have no doubt you struck Mr. Hario.

281
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,940
But that blow didn't kill him.

282
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,240
You ran away thinking that you'd killed him.

283
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
But he later regained consciousness.

284
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,940
Isn't that right, Mr. Akitaya?

285
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,440
Mr. Hario was really killed

286
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,440
by the fatal blow delivered

287
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,040
after he regained consciousness.

288
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,840
And person who could have done it

289
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,840
is the one who stayed behind after Ms. Nojima had left,

290
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,540
Mr. Akitaya, it was you.

291
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,140
Darn, that Eiko...

292
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,240
You'll pay for this.

293
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
Yes, you're right.

294
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,240
It was me, I killed Hario.

295
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,540
But... how...

296
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,240
how did you know he regained consciousness?

297
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,640
There was a lot of dirt and grass on the tips of his fingernails

298
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,340
and there were scratches on his fingertips

299
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,840
like they'd clutched the ground.

300
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,040
But according to Ms Nojima's statement...

301
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,740
He fell slowly then stopped moving.

302
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,840
If that were the case though,

303
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,840
his fingers wouldn't be in the condition they were.

304
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
And that's what told me,

305
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,140
Mr. Hario had regained consciousness after Ms. Nojima had left,

306
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,140
he clutched his head with his left hand

307
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,740
and put all his strength into his right hand

308
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,240
to pull himself up, he made several attempts...

309
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,540
and that's when the fatal blow was delivered.

310
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,840
The company...

311
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,540
I couldn't stand the thought of him buying it,

312
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,840
that's why I did it.

313
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,040
Are you sure...

314
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,340
that was your only reason?

315
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,540
If you hadn't done what you did,

316
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,140
I'm sure he would have gone to the police

317
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,240
and told them what Ms. Nojima had done.

318
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,040
You wanted to protect her.

319
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,940
Isn't that right, Mr. Akitaya?

320
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,440
Akitaya...

321
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,940
Still, it doesn't matter what the motive was

322
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,840
or what kind of person he was,

323
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,340
no human being should take another's life,

324
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,640
it's unforgivable.

325
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,340
Shinichi?

326
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
Shin...

327
