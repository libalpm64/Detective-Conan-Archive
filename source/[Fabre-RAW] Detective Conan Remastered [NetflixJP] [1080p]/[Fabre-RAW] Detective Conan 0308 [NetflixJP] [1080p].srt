1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,140
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,240
The unnatural death of the last days of the victim.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,740
A surprising message if found.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,460
Pops takes on the job of searching for the whereabouts

9
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,960
of a game system engineer, whose whereabouts became unknown.

10
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,960
But while listening to their story,

11
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
I found out that Mr. Itakura

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,260
had once had contact with the Black Organization.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,960
We somehow located the hotel where Mr. Itakura was hiding,

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,160
and went there,

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
but it turned out that he was already dead.

16
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,460
I see.

17
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,160
So Mr. Itakura was probably made to sit in the chair,

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,960
tied up with his hands on his chest,

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,960
and was unable to take his medicine unless somebody helped him drink it.

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,260
Then, don't tell me that this is...

21
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
A homicide.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Oh, no.

24
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,060
"The Remains of Voiceless Testimony (Part 2)"

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,560
"Katsumichi Sugai (39)" -Wait a second.

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,660
Why do we have to be suspected?

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,360
"Jouhei Naito (47)" -We the ones who asked Kogoro Mouri

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,260
to look for Mr. Itakura, you know.

29
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,360
"Ryusuke Soma (44)" -What stupid killer would come back

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,660
to the scene of a crime and bring a detective along?

31
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
I guess so.

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
If you insist on suspecting us, why don't you show evidence?

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,960
Evidence that we came here.

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Okay, the time's now.

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,860
If so, why don't you look at the diary in the bag?

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,560
That's his bag, isn't it?

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,160
Maybe we can find out

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,160
who came to visit him before we got here.

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,260
A "diary" is indeed written on it.

40
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,960
Officer Takagi, how do you look at this?

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,060
It can easily be viewed with the laptop computer on the desk.

42
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,260
But if I were the killer,

43
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,660
I would've gotten rid of something like that a long time ago.

44
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,260
This is it.

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,760
Mr. Itakura seems to have been keeping a diary every day since 5 years ago.

46
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,960
Which means it's in there, I'm sure.

47
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,960
The day two years ago when Tequila came to see him should be there.

48
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,460
Here it is. This is his most recent diary.

49
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,760
Three days ago.

50
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,460
"The hotel employee said something strange today.

51
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,760
Maybe one of the three found out what room I'm in?

52
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,660
Oh, well. All I've got to do is change hotels then."

53
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,960
You three are suspicious after all.

54
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,860
Isn't there a continuation to that diary?

55
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,660
No, there's none.

56
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,260
Then, I'll go put it back where it was.

57
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
Oh, okay.

58
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,260
All right.

59
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
No.

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,860
We'll pass it on to the forensic officers just to be on the safe side.

61
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,860
I agree.

62
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Shoots. If the police take it with them,

63
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
I won't ever get to see it again.

64
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,960
I've got to find the killer among the three as soon a possible

65
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,860
and prove that the diary has nothing to do with the murder.

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Cool head. I'm sure that something's been overlooked.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,160
That is, the clue to who the killer is.

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
Excuse me, inspector.

69
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,060
-What is it? -About the right ankle of the corpse...

70
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,760
Traces of his socks are left as seen by congested blood on his left leg,

71
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,160
while his right leg...

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,660
Take a look at this, no traces are left on his right leg.

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,460
On the other hand, on his right ankle,

74
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,960
there are traces of what look to be scratch marks

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,760
that seem to have been made by the toenail of his left foot.

76
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Which means that Mr. Itakura

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,760
tried to take the socks off from his right leg.

78
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,360
But why?

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,360
He was tied up in a place like this,

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
but why did he...

81
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,460
take off his socks?

82
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,660
I see, he did so to leave this behind.

83
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,560
No doubt about it. That person's the killer.

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,660
Moreover, if I use this to my advantage,

85
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,060
I can even get a hold of the diary, too.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,960
All right. Please take care of the autopsy, coroner.

87
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,460
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,260
Officer Takagi, give the diary of the victim to the forensic officer.

89
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,360
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,860
The point in question

91
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,460
is the one who orders Mr. Itakura to make the game software

92
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,060
and found Mr. Itakura's corpse.

93
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,860
The three of you who all employees of the same game company.

94
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,460
We're not from the same company.

95
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,160
We're all from different companies.

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,060
I am Sugai who asked him to make an Igo software.

97
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,160
I'm Naito who asked him to make a chess software.

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm Soma. I ordered a shogi software.

99
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,260
Please, let us go already.

100
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,560
We just happened to be brought here to this room

101
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,360
by Mr. Mouri who located where Mr. Itakura was.

102
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,960
Inspector, what about me?

103
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,260
Well, we know now that Mr. Itakura had been killed by someone,

104
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,260
but we don't have all the evidence to specify the killer.

105
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
I would like the Mouri group and all of you

106
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,060
to come over to the station at a later date.

107
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,360
Oh, great.

108
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,660
I was concerned about whether the drama

109
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,960
that I've been recording was being recorded right.

110
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,560
So, I guess I'll do as you say for now and...

111
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,860
No, I can't afford to leave just like that.

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,760
Oh, no. I mean, well...

113
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Who was that?

114
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm saying that we can't let the suspects leave this place.

115
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,860
Because the killer

116
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,960
is rejoicing with both arms open...

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,060
in front of our very eyes, thinking,

118
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,660
"How lucky that Inspector Megure is a klutz".

119
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,360
What?

120
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,660
Hey, Dad!

121
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,360
How rude!

122
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,760
Shape up, Pops.

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Saying all you did, Mouri.

124
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,260
I hope you know

125
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,160
who killed Mr. Itakura!

126
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Yes. Mr. Itakura himself told me.

127
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,360
Hey, don't tell me that you heard the voice of the corpse?

128
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,660
No way.

129
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,060
His ankle.

130
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,060
Inspector, you saw it too, didn't you?

131
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,260
Only Mr. Itakura's right ankle had no traces of socks being worn.

132
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,960
That's because the killer who came back to this room

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,660
after Mr. Itakura died,

134
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,260
thought that just one foot wearing a sock

135
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,060
would look unnatural and put in back on him.

136
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,560
Now, why did Mr. Itakura have to be barefooted?

137
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,260
Why?

138
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,760
It's because unless he is barefooted,

139
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
he couldn't grab a certain thing or order of something.

140
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,560
Grab something? Grab what?

141
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,860
Could it be...

142
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Yes.

143
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,460
Mr. Itakura used the time he had before his heart medicine wore out

144
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,260
and wrote the following with his right foot.

145
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,260
A dying message

146
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,760
that indicates who the killer is.

147
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,740
This is his dying message?

148
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,240
What on earth is written?

149
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,140
It looks nothing more than an incomplete game of Igo.

150
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,640
Inspector, please help me,

151
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,340
so that I can explain it simply and clearly.

152
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,740
Officer Takagi. Please give the disc with the diary inside

153
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,240
and the unopened disc that was in Mr. Itakura's bag to the inspector.

154
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,340
All right.

155
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,940
After that,

156
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,340
please sit at the desk where the laptop computer is, inspector.

157
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,540
But what does this have to do with the dying message?

158
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll explain later.

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,840
Will you please boot up the computer first of all?

160
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,940
Boot up?

161
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,440
Boot up.

162
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,340
Boot up?

163
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,540
Boot...

164
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
up.

165
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Inspector, to boot means to start the computer.

166
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,940
I'm just joking, I'm joking.

167
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,740
Next, move the data of the diary onto the desktop,

168
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,840
and put that into the empty disc.

169
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Open it, move it and put it in?

170
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,340
Oh, so all you have to do is copy the data

171
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,340
of the diary into the empty disc.

172
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,640
Like so.

173
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,440
"Copying from Disk to Desktop"

174
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,640
"Complete"

175
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Hey, Mouri.

176
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,140
Don't tell me that you're doing this

177
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,440
to make fun of me not being digital minded.

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,140
And then finally, please turn the computer off.

179
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,940
I can do that.

180
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,640
Why?

181
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,040
What's the matter?

182
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,340
Oh, that's...

183
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,740
Don't help him, Officer Takagi.

184
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,140
These electronic goods, I tell you...

185
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,040
You do this, and they all switch off!

186
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,840
You shouldn't pull the plug out abruptly like that!

187
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,240
Doing so may destroy the data within the computer

188
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,740
or cause damage.

189
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,540
But it didn't switch off even if I pushed the switch.

190
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,840
For safety reasons,

191
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,940
it's made so that you have to push the button for a while

192
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,640
before the computer switches off.

193
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,340
That's right.

194
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,840
That is a prohibited strategy

195
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,340
that computer users should not do.

196
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,740
And words like "boot" and "open"

197
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,740
are terms that are incomprehensible

198
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,840
unless the person uses the computer on a daily basis.

199
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,340
You've already figured out what's written on that Igo board, haven't you?

200
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,740
Do you understand?

201
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,040
No.

202
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
Isn't there something strange about this Igo stone?

203
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,340
What's strange about it?

204
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,740
Because when playing Igo,

205
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,540
if you surround your opponent's stone, you've got to take it,

206
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,740
and to leave a stone surrounded is a prohibited strategy.

207
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,440
Prohibited strategy?

208
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,940
There is some meaning to this Igo stone after all.

209
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,140
But, what could it be?

210
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,540
Okay, while everyone is distracted with their attention on the Igo stone,

211
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,840
I'll take out the disc with the copy of the diary.

212
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
What are you doing, Conan?

213
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Ran.

214
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,540
Hey, didn't you hide something just now?

215
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540
I didn't hide anything.

216
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
What are you doing then?

217
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,340
I thought they sort of looked like Igo stones.

218
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,540
The strange patterns on the seals that are pasted onto the keyboard.

219
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Patterns? Isn't this Braille?

220
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,340
Come to think of it,

221
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,140
Mr. Itakura's vision, just like mine was getting pretty bad,

222
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,040
so he told me he was learning Braille.

223
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Braille?

224
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,440
I get it!

225
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,640
So this is what Mr. Mouri was referring to when he said,

226
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,340
"Words that only people who know can understand".

227
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,740
Could this be Braille?

228
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
What do you think?

229
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,840
No. No form of Braille looks like this.

230
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,340
Oh, but if you ignore the white stones, it's readable.

231
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,640
And?

232
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,240
Well, it said,

233
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,040
"The killer is...

234
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,740
Soma".

235
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,840
"The evidence is

236
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,740
the watch."

237
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,040
Mr. Soma.

238
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,140
No way. Are you the killer?

239
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,440
Hey, how come it turns out like that?

240
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,940
Maybe somebody's trying to frame me or something.

241
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,740
No, you're the killer.

242
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,440
The reason is that you don't know about Igo nor Braille.

243
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,140
Therefore, the killer is the one

244
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,940
who still has conclusive evidence on him,

245
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,640
that's you, Mr. Soma...

246
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Wait a minute, Mouri.

247
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,540
Don't talk so fast,

248
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,040
and please explain things in order as you usually do.

249
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,140
The reason why he's the killer and the evidence that shows he is.

250
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Don't rush things. Cool head.

251
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,440
The copy of the diary is already in my hands.

252
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,840
Cool head, cool head.

253
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,140
Right, when Mr. Itakura left this dying message,

254
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,840
this is probably what he thought.

255
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,040
That the killer would return to this room for sure after he died

256
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,540
in order to undo the masking tape that is wrapped up in.

257
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,640
That's why he used this code

258
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,340
that Mr. Soma wouldn't be able to read or even suspect.

259
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,340
And besides, if his corpse is found,

260
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,840
you three would be questioned by the police

261
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,540
and it is certain that you will be shown the picture of this Igo Board.

262
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,740
He figured that Mr. Naito whose vision is bad enough

263
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,140
to have to trace the Braille in the elevator,

264
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,040
would read the Braille code

265
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,440
and that Mr. Sugai who asked him to make the Igo software

266
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,640
would think the prohibited strategy strange,

267
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,940
and that he would realize that this is some kind of code.

268
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,140
I see.

269
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,940
What about the watch which is the evidence?

270
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,840
The watch that Mr. Soma still has on him.

271
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,140
Mr. Itakura disappeared

272
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,640
and confined himself to this room a week ago.

273
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,240
Mr. Itakura is really finicky when it comes to watches

274
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
and has bad vision.

275
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,440
When you first came into this room,

276
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm sure Mr. Itakura naturally took it and looked at it.

277
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,340
The wristwatch that is your pride and joy.

278
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,940
I see.

279
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,840
If his fingerprints are on the wristwatch

280
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,240
that would be evidence.

281
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,640
Yes.

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,540
Mr. Itakura who has turned corpse

283
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,940
and meets his killer again after a week,

284
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,440
could not have touched Mr. Soma's watch

285
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,540
that was bought 5 days ago.

286
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
Mr. Soma,

287
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,040
could we have the forensic officers check your wristwatch then?

288
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,240
Yes, go on and check it.

289
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
I'm sure that his prints will be found all over the place.

290
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,540
I put a sleeping drug into his wine

291
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,440
while he was absorbed in this wristwatch,

292
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,340
put him to sleep and wrapped him tightly with masking tape.

293
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,540
20 years ago, when he was a no-name game creator

294
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,540
and I was a green-horn that just entered the game company,

295
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,540
we were shogi pals who used to go to play shogi together.

296
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,040
We used to talk a lot while drinking together.

297
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,140
And we talked of making a shogi software

298
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,740
that would outdo the masters of shogi when we became big shots.

299
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,440
But three days ago, when I finally found where he was,

300
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,740
he said to me as I walked into his room,

301
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,340
"How many times do you think we should allow a person to call wait?"

302
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,840
What a laugh, don't you think?

303
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
I collected cash from the master play games

304
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,740
and kept sending it to him for 20 years.

305
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,240
And all I had to go on were his words, "The time is ripe".

306
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,540
I went into a great amount of debt investing in him, too.

307
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,440
And yet, he has the nerve to say, "Wait"

308
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,140
to a real master of shogi software

309
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,540
that was supposed to have been completed.

310
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,740
I told him I was going to get some wine to energize him

311
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,540
and left the room.

312
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,940
I bought some sleeping drug and masking tape along with the wine.

313
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,140
I didn't refuse your offer to make Kogoro Mouri search for him

314
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,440
because I wanted to avoid being suspected even slightly later.

315
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,740
After all, I used to talk stink about Itakura at the company a lot

316
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,540
because he wouldn't get to making the shogi software

317
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,740
but became famous as a computer graphics designer.

318
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,540
But 20 years was much too long a wait for both of us.

319
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,340
Being apart changes people...

320
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Their hearts, their dreams. Everything.

321
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,540
If I can call "wait" to life,

322
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,240
I'd like to go back to 20 years ago.

323
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,840
To the time when we both held the same dream.

324
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
See you, Ran.

325
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,540
I still have some things to talk over with this groggy father of yours here

326
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,440
so if you're going home, hail a cab or something and...

327
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,640
No, because it only takes about 30 minutes to walk home from here.

328
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,340
Bye, inspector!

329
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,540
I have it. It's right here.

330
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:14,040
In my pocket, the clue to those men in the Black Organization.

331
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,940
Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's house

332
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,640
and check this disk thoroughly.

333
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,340
Conan?

334
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,840
I wonder if people change.

335
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,640
If they're apart, will their feelings change?

336
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,940
It's kind of tough

337
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,140
to just keep on waiting.

338
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,840
You don't have to worry about Shinichi.

339
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,940
I think he's just the way you picture him to be, Ran.

340
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,540
So, I don't think you have to worry about him at all.

341
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,640
It would be nice if you were Shinichi, Conan.

342
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
How stupid of me, what on earth am I talking about?

343
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,240
Ran, that's not it.

344
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,640
I...

345
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,140
Actually, I am...

346
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,540
No. I can't tell her.

347
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,040
Not until I disclose their identity.

348
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,440
Until I crush them.

349
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,740
I can't tell anybody about me.

350
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,840
You're...

351
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,040
Next Conan's Hint:

352
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,420
"Diary"
