1
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:03,983
Doji Hiramune, a criminal psychologist,

2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:05,985
makes repeated challenging comments

3
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:08,542
against the serial killer

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,342
whose case will expire in three days,

5
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,993
but he is found murdered to death in his house.

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,442
The letter Z is found carved on his back.

7
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:22,001
The letters E, S, and W were also found on the bodies

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,442
of the three victims of the serial murder case.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,442
From the fact that the suspicious man

10
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:30,642
that Ai and Ayumi witnessed was whistling.

11
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:32,842
The police concludes that it is yet another series of murders

12
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,742
committed by the same serial killer.

13
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:38,642
I accompany Officer Takagi who goes to visit

14
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:42,021
the bereaved family of the victims

15
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,342
and realize that the thing in common

16
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:46,025
that connects the four victims is mahjong.

17
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:52,031
I'll expose the true identity of the serial killer for sure.

18
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,542
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

19
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,842
Saturday nights are for mystery.

20
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,042
Officer Takagi is all out to get but falls into a pitfall.

21
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,042
Love as well as the case takes a sudden turn.

22
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,642
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:06,342
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:08,442
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:55,038
"An Old Scar and the Soul of the Detective"

26
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,138
I know these people.

27
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,838
They used to come here and play mahjong together long time ago.

28
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:04,938
They used to be one of my favorite guests.

29
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:07,038
How nostalgic.

30
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,438
Who is he?

31
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:12,171
He's Mr. Hiramune a criminal psychologist.

32
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:16,175
Only that picture is a very recent one.

33
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,638
He's the student that used to play with the three all the time.

34
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:22,938
Which means that these four men used to play mahjong here?

35
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:27,638
Yes, they would get together at 10 pm on Saturday nights.

36
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:28,838
The doctor,

37
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:30,738
assistant professor of the science and technology department,

38
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:31,938
a man who just became a lawyer

39
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:35,338
and the university student that was studying criminal psychology.

40
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:38,197
Although they were of different ages, they seem to get along very well.

41
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:42,201
They used to discuss actual incidents that happened while playing mahjong.

42
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:44,538
They would say things like the culprit

43
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:46,538
is the one who was answering the interview,

44
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:49,338
or that it was a trick using medical knowledge.

45
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:53,238
Moreover, it's amazing that they were virtually almost always correct.

46
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:55,838
And? What about the four?

47
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:59,638
They were all murdered by the same killer.

48
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,538
What?

49
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,238
Four of them, all at once?

50
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:06,838
No, the first one was murdered 20 years ago.

51
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:08,227
Don't you know about it?

52
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,838
I don't watch the news much.

53
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,338
Because all I used to do was check the cases

54
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,738
that they deduced in the papers.

55
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,738
Well, but I did so only during the two years

56
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,138
that they used to come here.

57
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:22,241
After they stopped coming, I stopped buying the papers too.

58
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:23,838
They stopped coming?

59
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:24,838
Yes.

60
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:28,038
They were saying something about a perfect crime or something

61
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,249
but I couldn't hear them too well.

62
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,538
After the others stopped coming,

63
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,253
this student kept coming for a while.

64
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,938
He used to sit at the table alone,

65
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:39,238
looking sad as he wiped the tiles.

66
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,638
Maybe that guy is the killer.

67
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,838
Do you have an idea who it may be?

68
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:51,138
There was a man who used to always give them a piece of his mind.

69
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:55,838
And after the remaining members stopped coming,

70
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,538
that man used to take the opportunity to hassle

71
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,279
the student who was waiting all alone.

72
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,838
Back then, that man shouted,

73
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,738
"I'm going to get all of you!"

74
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,938
Do you know who that man is?

75
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,038
I wonder...

76
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,438
I heard that he had a reputation for doing all kinds of wrong

77
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,138
but I have no idea what his name is.

78
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:17,038
Remember that incident long ago when a gun was stolen?

79
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,538
While the police officer at the police box was put to sleep and off guard,

80
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:22,301
the gun was stolen and freaked everybody out.

81
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,738
But two days later the gun was sent back and returned.

82
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:30,038
It was rumored that the man was the one who did that too.

83
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,038
This is the mahjong tile that was thrown

84
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,313
when they got into a big fight.

85
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,438
It's scratched so it can't be used anymore.

86
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,838
Did that man throw the tiles?

87
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:42,321
Yes.

88
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,138
And who put the tiles away?

89
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,325
Me.

90
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,329
After the police came to stop the two and took them away.

91
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,938
I gathered the tiles alone and put them away in this case.

92
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:55,738
Which means that the only fingerprints

93
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:58,138
on the scratched tiles are yours, Mr. Hiramune,

94
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:02,138
and that man's, right?

95
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:04,038
Who is this kid?

96
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,345
He's here with me to study social studies.

97
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,138
Besides if the man was taken along with the police,

98
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:11,238
there may be some kind of record left.

99
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,838
Right.

100
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:18,638
Then, I'm going to take this scratched tile with me.

101
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,838
And, your fingerprint too.

102
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:26,365
Come to think of it, I got a strange phone call last week.

103
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,238
The person said, "20 years ago, the people who used to play

104
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,538
at the table were a doctor, assistant professor, a lawyer,

105
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:34,638
and a criminal psychologist, right?"

106
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:35,838
What?

107
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:38,938
You were able to specify a man who could be the serial killer?

108
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:41,538
Yes, sir. There was a record of the man

109
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:43,338
who was brought to the police

110
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:45,438
after getting into a fight with Mr. Hiramune.

111
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,538
His address is unknown and he's unemployed.

112
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:48,938
His name is...

113
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,389
Dokuro Kibo.

114
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,938
Kibo?

115
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:53,538
Dokuro Kibo?

116
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,938
You mean that Kibo, who robbed and committed murder?

117
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,938
If I remember correctly,

118
00:06:57,938 --> 00:06:59,838
I heard he finished his term of 15 years,

119
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,401
and was released just the other day.

120
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:06,405
Which means that the serial murders had stopped for 15 years because...

121
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:10,138
Which means he couldn't do anything because he was behind bars.

122
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,038
Yes, sir. Most probably.

123
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,438
Okay.

124
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:15,738
Search out the guy right away

125
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,638
and bring him before me.

126
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,417
Yes, sir!

127
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,538
Officer Takagi is sure out to get, isn't he?

128
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:25,138
Maybe he found himself a girlfriend or something.

129
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:26,425
Yes.

130
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,427
There has been such rumors going around here and there.

131
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,138
Tell him to keep on his guard.

132
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:33,938
You know, like you see on TV and the movies.

133
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,238
Stories about officers who die on duty

134
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:38,437
because just as they are about to carry out an important

135
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,838
promise with their loved one,

136
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:42,441
they fall prey to the bullet of the culprit.

137
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,538
But those are only made up stories.

138
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,238
Morimura ended up that way too.

139
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,038
His wedding was coming up in a month,

140
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,451
so for the sake of his wife-to-be

141
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,455
he wanted to make as many points as possible and rushed things.

142
00:07:56,455 --> 00:08:00,038
And as a result, he ended up being run over by the suspect's car.

143
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:02,461
Let's go, Officer Sato.

144
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,538
Yes.

145
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:07,538
Maybe I've aged.

146
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,338
This scar...

147
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,038
I reacted to a man who just happened

148
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,138
to meet the suspect at a sauna.

149
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:16,475
And today, when I went into the house of the fourth victim,

150
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,138
this scar of mine was throbbing.

151
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:20,738
But, now only several hours later,

152
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:23,338
the throbbing's gone away

153
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,538
as if nothing has happened.

154
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,238
It could be that the heavens are telling me

155
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:31,838
that my mission is over.

156
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,838
Gee.

157
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:37,538
I thought that Officer Takagi was working unusually fast

158
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:40,499
but come to find out Conan did all the work.

159
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,501
So, I guess the thing about going to a hot spring

160
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,638
isn't going to be realized then.

161
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:44,938
What?

162
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:47,838
Why don't you go either way? Go to the hot spring with him.

163
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:50,138
After all, he did pin down the culprit.

164
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,838
Don't be stingy about it.

165
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:54,938
No. Personal feelings shouldn't be mixed up with work.

166
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:56,515
I almost forgot

167
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,517
that this job of ours is one in which we could lose our lives

168
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,038
with just one slight mistake.

169
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:04,838
I'll take the children home in my car,

170
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:06,838
so you go and join Officer Chiba and the others

171
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,527
and investigate Kibo.

172
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,638
Will do.

173
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,138
Yes. Sato here.

174
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,538
What? You took custody of Kibo?

175
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:21,238
We just found him in his apartment

176
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:23,938
and asked him to come of his own initiative to the police,

177
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,938
and is heading this way.

178
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,738
Have Eiki, Mr. Nabei's son come over here.

179
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:29,938
You're going to have him confirm his voice, right?

180
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:33,238
Because he heard the voice of the suspect when he was a child.

181
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:35,238
Right. I'm counting on you.

182
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,557
Officer Takagi, I'll leave Eiki to you.

183
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,338
Yes, will do.

184
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,338
He was arrested quite easily, wasn't he?

185
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,138
The serial killer.

186
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,638
I thought there was going to be more exciting chasing

187
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,838
and around and all that.

188
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,238
With a lot of guns firing and all.

189
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:54,573
That's only in the movies and on TV.

190
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,575
The actually is quite bland.

191
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,338
You don't look happy.

192
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:03,238
The letter Z that was left on Mr. Hiramune's back's bugging me.

193
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:05,538
Since the letters in the order of E, S, W

194
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:10,589
were found on the body of the victims who were killed

195
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,591
in the previous three cases, the last letter should be N.

196
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:16,595
Maybe the letters really meant nothing after all?

197
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,038
If it meant east, west, south and north

198
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:22,601
the order of the letters should be EWSN and not ESWN.

199
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:26,605
No, but in mahjong the order is east, south, west and north,

200
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:29,838
so it should be E, S, W,

201
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,611
but I wonder why the last letter is Z?

202
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,138
He was probably going to knock the corpse down on its side

203
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,038
after he committed the murder.

204
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:39,038
If you turn the letter Z sideways, it becomes an N.

205
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:43,538
If so, I wonder why he didn't turn the corpse sideways.

206
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:44,623
True.

207
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:46,638
What concerns me is...

208
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:50,038
the "Ctrl" key that Mr. Hiramune put his blood on.

209
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:53,038
In other words, the control key and "C" key,

210
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:54,633
with these two keys,

211
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,038
I can tell he's trying to point out the computer,

212
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,838
but I can't figure out why he's holding the cord of the mouse.

213
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:01,238
Mouse?

214
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:05,338
That sort of round thing that you use to operate the computer.

215
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:08,338
The cord that is connected to it looks like the tail of a mouse,

216
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,938
so that's how it got it's name.

217
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:15,338
Then, he's holding the tail of the mouse

218
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,338
so that person is a cat.

219
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:22,338
Gee, come off it. Ayumi, what a cute thing to say!

220
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:25,238
Very true.

221
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:27,938
You don't have to laugh so hard.

222
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,238
Cat...

223
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,438
I see, that's what it was.

224
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:37,738
This serial killer case had ended 15 years ago.

225
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,138
Give me a break, officer.

226
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,938
After serving a term of 15 years,

227
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:44,683
I finally got out.

228
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,938
I'd never commit murder again.

229
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:50,689
Do you think this guy's the culprit?

230
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:51,838
If we have Mr. Eiki Nabei

231
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:54,438
who heard the voice of the suspect when he was a child,

232
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,695
wouldn't that clear everything?

233
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:01,538
What if it were you?

234
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:05,438
What would you do if an officer

235
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,838
who left a large sword scar on your face appeared before you?

236
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,138
Well, I think I'd be surprised.

237
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:14,738
The man didn't even raise a brow when he passed me.

238
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:19,338
Maybe this guy Dokuro Kibo is...

239
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,738
What? Dokuro Kibo isn't the serial killer?

240
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:24,723
What makes you say that?

241
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:31,138
I'm sure Mr. Hiramune knows what kind of person the culprit is.

242
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:34,733
Besides, if the two fought in the past at the mahjong parlor,

243
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,138
it's hard to believe that they would want to see each other,

244
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:39,038
just the two of them.

245
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:42,338
Moreover, in Mr. Hiramune's dying message says that

246
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:47,038
the serial killer didn't kill him.

247
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:50,138
Blood was on the control key and C key,

248
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,938
pushing both keys means "copy".

249
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,638
He was holding the cord of the mouse,

250
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:56,755
which meant he was the cat that had grabbed the mouse's tail.

251
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,838
Put the two together and you get the word "copycat".

252
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:02,761
In other words, his message was that the one who killed him

253
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,763
copied the murder method of the serial killer.

254
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:06,765
A mimicked murder?

255
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:10,138
What's that, some kind of minced meat or something?

256
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:13,638
It's this tomato tasting Italian soup with vegetables in it.

257
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:15,038
That's minestrone.

258
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:17,838
A mimicked murder is

259
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,438
when someone copies somebody else's murder method

260
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,438
to commit a murder.

261
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,783
But, why is it a cat?

262
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,638
The word copycat was comes from

263
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,238
the fact that kittens copy their parents.

264
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:32,791
But, how did Mr. Hiramune know that the killer was a copycat?

265
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:35,438
He knew because...

266
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:38,438
Mr. Hiramune, who was killed

267
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:40,438
was actually the serial killer himself.

268
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:41,938
What?

269
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:45,238
If so, it's not hard to understand

270
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:48,038
why the letter Z was found on his back.

271
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:51,938
The serial killer is supposed to have a large sword scar

272
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:55,538
that was made by Superintendent Matsumoto on his back.

273
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:57,438
In order to make his scar inconspicuous,

274
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:01,638
to ward off any suspicion that he may be the serial killer,

275
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:05,338
Mr. Hiramune secretly wrote the alphabet Z over his scar.

276
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,825
I see.

277
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,238
Then, this murder could be made

278
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:12,238
to look as if it were the serial murder case too.

279
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,833
Yes, if the police is made to believe so,

280
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,238
they will keep pursuing the dead serial murder

281
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:21,638
and the culprit figured that their hands would never reach over to him.

282
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:25,138
And? Who is that copycat?

283
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:28,538
If he's the guy that was whistling,

284
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:31,538
it's one of the members of the bereaved family.

285
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,338
"Nabei"

286
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:39,838
Strange. The lights are on and yet.

287
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,861
It's open.

288
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,138
Mr. Nabei.

289
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:48,038
I'm from the police, I just visited you a while ago.

290
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:51,538
Mr. Nabei, will you please come with me to the station?

291
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:52,871
Mr. Nabei!

292
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,573
All the members of the bereaved family may know

293
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:06,573
that the letter of the alphabet was carved on the victim's back,

294
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:12,891
but the only one who knows that the killer whistles a certain tune,

295
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,893
or uses mahjong terminology is...

296
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:15,873
It can't be.

297
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,273
Mr. Eiki Nabei who was in the house together with the killer

298
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:19,573
at the time of the murder?

299
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:23,673
Right, he knows the voice of the killer

300
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,905
so after hearing Mr. Hiramune's voice and his way of talking

301
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,173
through the many TV appearances he made,

302
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:31,373
he probably called all the mahjong parlors

303
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:32,911
that his father may have stopped by at,

304
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,873
and after he found the link between Mr. Hiramune and the three victims

305
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:39,973
he was convinced that Mr. Hiramune was the serial killer.

306
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,473
It probably took him 15 years before he realized the truth

307
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:48,173
because Eiki wasn't familiar with mahjong terminology until he grew up.

308
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,673
Please wait.

309
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:53,673
He's the one who was angry when went to his house a while ago, right?

310
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:56,073
Officer Takagi went to get him.

311
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:03,573
Just as would be expected of an officer pursuing a serial murder case,

312
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:06,945
you're armed with a gun.

313
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,973
But, seeing that you've come here alone only shows

314
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:14,953
that I'm not deemed to be the culprit yet.

315
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,273
The culprit?

316
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:20,273
Don't tell me that you killed your own father 15 years ago?

317
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:21,973
Idiot.

318
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,673
-Hiramune did that. -What?

319
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:27,873
I avenged my father's death today.

320
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,473
I called Hiramune and told him,

321
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,573
"I just remembered something about the case 15 years ago,

322
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:36,473
so before going to the police, I'd like to discuss it with you

323
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:39,273
since you're a criminal psychologist."

324
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:42,373
He didn't have the slightest idea that I was going to take revenge.

325
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:44,573
I threatened him just a bit

326
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:46,573
and he started talking away..

327
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,987
The motive for him killing my father and the others

328
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:50,973
was the topic that was brought up when they were playing mahjong,

329
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,573
"The perfect crime..."

330
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:53,773
They were talking about

331
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:57,773
whether they could steal a gun from the police box.

332
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:59,473
They had split opinions,

333
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:01,273
but Hiramune decided to actually do it

334
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:05,473
and prove that a perfect crime could indeed be committed.

335
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:08,173
However, although he thought that everyone would praise him

336
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:10,173
the doctor and the assistant professor despised him

337
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:13,773
saying that they couldn't continue playing mahjong with a criminal.

338
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,013
Thinking that it would affect his future

339
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:18,073
if what he did were to be exposed, he said he killed them.

340
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,473
Although as a joke,

341
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,973
my father urged him to commit the perfect crime as well.

342
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,273
So felt that he also responsible and didn't say anything for a while.

343
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:27,473
But five years later,

344
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,973
my father suggested that they turn themselves in to the police.

345
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:33,573
That's why he said he shut my father up the same way he did the others.

346
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:36,273
So, what shall I do now?

347
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:39,973
I'd probably be caught right away even if I took your car and fled.

348
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:45,043
That's my cell phone.

349
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,473
It's a call from your girlfriend, officer?

350
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:51,049
Good timing, tell her to come here.

351
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,673
"Miwako Sato" -I'll use her as hostage.

352
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,773
Why? Don't worry.

353
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,473
If I get to flee safely, I'll let her go free.

354
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:02,273
Hurry up and answer the phone.

355
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:03,473
I'm sure you already know.

356
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,873
Don't say anything. If you do, I'm firing this gun.

357
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:11,573
I guess my cell phone broke.

358
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:14,773
I guess I'm the only hostage left.

359
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:17,773
Why you...

360
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,573
What? The suspect is Eiki Nabei?

361
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:26,573
Yes, sir. He's at least most likely the one who killed Mr. Hiramune.

362
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,473
I can't get hold of Officer Takagi who went to pick him up.

363
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,473
Please send a back up crew to him immediately.

364
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:34,173
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

365
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,973
Calling all officers.

366
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,073
Head for the Nabei residence on the double.

367
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:41,973
There's a possibility that the suspect has possession of Takagi's gun.

368
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:45,373
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him.

369
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:49,107
Listen! Life is lost in a split second.

370
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:51,573
Officer Takagi.

371
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:58,873
Why you...

372
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,119
How dare you!

373
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,127
Darn.

374
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,673
You asked for it.

375
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,773
Darn. Dogs...

376
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:15,773
They've figured it out.

377
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,073
No, Officer Sato?

378
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:22,373
No. Don't come in now.

379
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,373
Officer Sato...

380
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,073
Oh, no.

381
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,773
Officer Takagi was shot?

382
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,273
"Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital"

383
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:46,673
What?

384
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:47,673
So...

385
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:51,169
it turned out the way it usually does in movies and dramas.

386
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,171
No.

387
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,573
Why does Officer Takagi have to die

388
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,273
just because we promised to go to the hot spring together?

389
00:19:58,273 --> 00:19:59,177
Hot spring?

390
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,773
Officer Takagi!

391
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:02,773
Oh, no, I mean...

392
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:04,373
You know, the usual?

393
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,573
The evidence that he coincidentally put inside his pocket

394
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,073
during the investigation

395
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,173
saved his life from the culprit's bullet.

396
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:13,973
The mahjong tile.

397
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:15,473
Come to think of it,

398
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:18,473
he was putting one inside his chest pocket at the mahjong parlor.

399
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:23,473
Thanks to Officer Takagi knocking down Eiki Nabei despite being shot at,

400
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,773
the officer who burst into the room was able to nab Nabei

401
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:27,773
without getting hurt.

402
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,873
I guess it can be said that Eiki was also a victim of this case,

403
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,973
which pushed him to do what he did.

404
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:33,873
Then, how is Officer Takagi?

405
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:35,573
He's gone through treatment

406
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:37,973
and is sleeping in his room now.

407
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:39,673
He's fast asleep.

408
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:04,673
What was the meaning of that whistling?

409
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:06,373
The feeling of the composer,

410
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:07,973
"Let's stay the we are" was weaved into the song.

411
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:11,973
In other words, Hiramune wanted to continue the deduction battles

412
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:14,973
that they had continued for two years,

413
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:18,173
and that's why Hiramune Doji is thought to have whistled that tune,

414
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:20,173
according to Superintendent Matsumoto.

415
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,873
I see.

416
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,321
Well, but...

417
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:24,673
With this wound,

418
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,873
we can't possibly go to the hot spring that we promised to go together.

419
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:30,273
You mean that promise was still valid?

420
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:33,973
Yes. I mean you were just great

421
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:35,673
so I was looking forward to it.

422
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:37,973
But, too bad I guess.

423
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:41,339
I always end up like this, don't I?

424
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,343
Even back during the bomb explosion case

425
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:47,345
and the Hammer man case.

426
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:48,773
I'm almost about to make it,

427
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:50,873
but can't seem to make it through.

428
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,355
Where's Takagi's room?

429
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,873
I think it's room 304.

430
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:03,361
Hot spring. Hot spring?

431
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:06,273
You can't seem to make it through for what?

432
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:07,373
Oh, no.

433
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,367
Well, something gets in the way and...

434
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,369
"Wataru Takagi"

435
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:12,973
Wait!

436
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,873
Conan?

437
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:18,073
Officer Takagi, just drank his tranquilizer a while ago.

438
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:19,773
And he just fell asleep.

439
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,673
Maybe it's better...

440
00:23:21,673 --> 00:23:23,381
Not to wake him.

441
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,383
I think you should come back later.

442
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:26,673
I see.

443
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,973
Let's come again in the evening.

444
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,573
I guess so.

445
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:55,773
So, now we get to go to the hot spring with them.

446
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:57,173
Yes.

447
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:59,773
No, I don't think so.

448
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,396
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:05,800
"Kudo" -"Name plate".

450
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,425
The nameplate at my house says "Yoshida".

451
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,682
What about you, Conan?

452
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:09,806
Mouri's written.

453
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:10,640
Free-loaders sure have it tough.
