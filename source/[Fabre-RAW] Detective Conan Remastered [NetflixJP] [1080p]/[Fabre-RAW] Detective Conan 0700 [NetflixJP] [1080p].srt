1
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:06,755
Ai, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

2
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:10,955
and I came to the campsite on Dr. Agasa's Beetle.

3
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:12,755
Doc and I separated with the members of the detective squad

4
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:15,555
to go and shop for the canteens that Doc forgot to bring.

5
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:17,955
We coincidentally run into Masumi Sera.

6
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,955
She decides to join us at the campsite.

7
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,155
On the other hand, Ai and the members of the detective squad

8
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,055
who go into the forest to pick firewood.

9
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:31,455
There, they run into a man who is burying the dead body of a woman!

10
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:33,755
A woman...

11
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,855
Is being buried.

12
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:38,555
Run!

13
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,355
Ai and the children flee desperately

14
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,555
unable to get though to me.

15
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,455
They decide to hide in a mountain cabin in the forest.

16
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,255
How about it, Mitsuhiko?

17
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:52,855
There seems to be no other entrance. That's the only one.

18
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,955
Hey, what's the matter?

19
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:59,055
I'm fine.

20
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:00,955
The floor was just wet.

21
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:09,455
It can't be...

22
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,655
The woman a while ago was...

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,655
If so, 9 out of 10 he'll come back here

24
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,555
to this blood smeared site of the crime.

25
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,855
The culprit...

26
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:24,455
Then, we'll have to hurry out of here.

27
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:25,855
True!

28
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:28,855
At that time, we joined Inspector Yamamura and the others

29
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,055
who had come to the site after being contacted by Ai.

30
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,755
The three suspects thought

31
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,855
to have been burying the corpse were also found.

32
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:37,355
Big trouble!

33
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:41,455
The door's chained and we can't get out!

34
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,755
Ai! We've been locked in!

35
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:49,955
Ai. Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

36
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:52,055
Come to think of it, yes.

37
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,255
It can't be...

38
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:58,055
Isn't this mountain cabin burning?

39
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:59,455
We've got to hurry and flee!

40
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:02,855
Darn it! This door won't budge!

41
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,555
What shall we do? We don't have the strength.

42
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:10,555
We'll be fine, calm down!

43
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,855
I'm sure someone will notice the smoke

44
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,055
and come to rescue us.

45
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:16,755
That' right.

46
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,255
Conan.

47
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:24,955
Smoke?

48
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:28,555
Hey, it's some distance away but there's smoke rising!

49
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:33,555
That's probably the smoke from a camp fire.

50
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,655
See, there's another one over there, too.

51
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,355
For some reason recently, a lot of young kids

52
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:42,455
make large bonfires from noon and really live it up.

53
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,855
Inspector Yamamura!

54
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:46,855
Regarding the report we got earlier,

55
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,755
I brought the three men.

56
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:52,455
Is that right? Good work!

57
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:16,555
Aim for a 100% solution.

58
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,755
Clear all mysteries and codes.

59
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:20,455
A dark shadow that closes in on Ai.

60
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,555
A small mistake that was left behind.

61
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,055
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,955
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,355
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:15,008
"Shadow Closes on Ai's Secret (Part 2)"

65
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:18,308
Then, will you all one by one give me your names, occupation

66
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:21,708
and the reason you came here.

67
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,708
I'm Hayamichi Yonezumi, a free-lancer.

68
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,108
I don't know what happened,

69
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,208
but since I'm coming here next week with my friends,

70
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,608
I came to check this place out!

71
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:35,508
My name is Chozo Usagi.

72
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,108
I'm a photographer.

73
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:41,108
I take pictures of campsites throughout Japan.

74
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,108
I also came to take pictures.

75
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:45,908
I wanted to take pictures of Japanese azalea

76
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:48,008
on my cell phone camera to upload on my blog

77
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:51,408
because they bloom orange flowers during this season.

78
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:53,808
My name is Takeya Iwakuma.

79
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,908
I'm a senior at Beika University.

80
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:59,808
But you're all dressed very lightly.

81
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:02,108
I just came to check the place out, you know.

82
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:04,308
Same with me.

83
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:07,408
My camera and equipment are in my car.

84
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,708
I just dropped by.

85
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,108
How is it?

86
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:15,408
I can't get through yet.

87
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,708
I'm sure that Ai would move to a place

88
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,508
where the cell phone will work.

89
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,708
If they're still being pursued by the culprit

90
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,808
and she can't make the call because of it,

91
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:28,308
then maybe the culprit's not among the three?

92
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:31,508
Or I don't want to think this,

93
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,308
but maybe they've already been killed by someone

94
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:36,808
including those three.

95
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,708
Or they may be in a situation

96
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,408
where that can't move for some reason.

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,608
Everybody, get a hold of yourself!

98
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:52,408
Keep your heads down low to avoid inhaling smoke!

99
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:55,008
I'm sure that help is on the way!

100
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:59,908
But I wonder when they'll come?

101
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:02,708
There's smoke over on the other side, too.

102
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,608
I wonder if it's a camp fire?

103
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:05,808
No!

104
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,708
Then maybe they won't notice our smoke?

105
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,608
Oh, no.

106
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:14,908
I've got no choice than... but to...

107
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,908
All three of them wear size 26 (cm)?

108
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,208
-Really? -Yeah.

109
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,908
My shoe size, right?

110
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:26,008
What about it?

111
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:29,808
Darn it. If the culprit is among those three,

112
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,108
the sooner the better to find out who he is,

113
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,008
so that we can get info on where everyone is.

114
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,908
That's the fastest way.

115
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,708
How troubling.

116
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,808
The detective badges of the children were all in the tent.

117
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:44,308
I think we should go to search, too.

118
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,108
Going in search randomly

119
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,608
will just get us lost in the forest!

120
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,608
I think we should let the search team

121
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:52,408
who know about the mountains do their job.

122
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:55,408
But the sun's starting to set

123
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,708
and our shadows are getting longer, too.

124
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,508
We've got to find them before it gets dark.

125
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,108
-Shadow? -Shadow?

126
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,908
I see.

127
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:08,708
So, that's the story.

128
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,508
Ayumi?

129
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:19,608
Get a hold of yourself! Ayumi!

130
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,008
Ayumi! Get up, Ayumi!

131
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:25,408
Genta! Let's take Ayumi closer to the door!

132
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,208
We've got to make her breathe the air outside!

133
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,008
I see! Get a hold of yourself, Ayumi!

134
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,108
We're going to move you!

135
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:34,008
I'll let you breathe delicious air right now!

136
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,608
Here, it's air from outside! Ayumi!

137
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,908
It's good, isn't it? Right, Ayumi?

138
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:41,208
Get a hold of yourself, Ayumi!

139
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,008
Ayumi! Get up, Ayumi!

140
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:45,508
Ayumi!

141
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,308
What was that sound?

142
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,908
It looks like the door opened.

143
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:55,108
It can't be. We're the only ones here.

144
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:59,408
Don't tell me that the culprit came back.

145
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,854
Hey, officer.

146
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:45,154
Isn't it about time you tell us what's going on?

147
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:48,054
You've got to tell us

148
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,654
or I can't cooperate anymore.

149
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:54,354
I've got things to do after this too, you see.

150
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:55,754
The thing is,

151
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:59,454
the body of a woman was found dumped in the mountain.

152
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:02,454
The culprit is still on the run.

153
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,854
-What? -What?

154
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,654
That's why we had you,

155
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:09,254
who were walking alone in the mountains come here.

156
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:12,254
Hey, hey.

157
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:15,054
Will all three of you show me both hands?

158
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:16,854
-Huh? -Why?

159
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:19,154
Because I was watching all this time,

160
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:22,154
but Mr. Yonezumi and Iwakuma used only your left hands.

161
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,154
But, Mr. Usami, you used only your right hand!

162
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:28,054
I just thought that maybe you have a scar on the other hand

163
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,354
and is hiding it!

164
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:31,554
Geez.

165
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:35,454
I was using my left hand because I'm left handed.

166
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,854
See? My right hand has no scar, does it?

167
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:41,054
Same here. I'm a lefty.

168
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,854
I used only my right hand because I'm right handed.

169
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,254
Of course there's nothing on my left hand, too.

170
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:51,554
But, Mr. Usagi...

171
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,754
The culprit was also right handed!

172
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,154
Huh?

173
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,954
What're you talking about?

174
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,754
All you saw was the woman

175
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:02,254
that the culprit was trying to bury and the hole, right?

176
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:05,454
It was left near the corpse and the hole.

177
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:08,954
The evidence that the culprit was right-handed!

178
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:10,154
Evidence?

179
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:12,754
The scar on the victim was slashed from the top right to the bottom

180
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,354
with something like an axe.

181
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:17,154
Which means that

182
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:20,454
the culprit who slashed her was probably right-handed.

183
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,754
The footprints of the culprit around the hole,

184
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:25,554
showed that the left foot was in front and the right behind.

185
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,454
Such footprints can't be left behind

186
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,754
unless a right-handed person digs the hole, right?

187
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:34,354
That's true.

188
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:38,254
What? Then, what? Is he the culprit?

189
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:42,254
What? Come on, give me a break.

190
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:45,454
If you have anything to say, say it now.

191
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,354
I mean, there are loads of right-handers around!

192
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,854
These two may actually be right-handers that are hiding it

193
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:56,054
and forcing themselves to use their left.

194
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,554
I wonder about that.

195
00:11:58,554 --> 00:11:59,954
Besides, see...

196
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:03,754
The culprit may still be hiding in the mountains somewhere.

197
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:07,354
It's true that most Japanese are right-handed,

198
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,754
but the only one who, at around the time of the crime,

199
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,154
was wandering around this mountain,

200
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:16,854
and called Usami, who is right-handed is you.

201
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:18,054
What?

202
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:21,154
Come on, Conan.

203
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,554
Where at the site was there such a name?

204
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:26,954
The woman victim taught us, didn't she?

205
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,354
Inside the sleeping bag she was put in...

206
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:32,454
She made this shape with her fingers and told us.

207
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:35,154
What of that becomes the name Usagi?

208
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,254
It's hard to tell just from the shape made by her fingers,

209
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:41,554
but if you place the right and left hand on top of each other...

210
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:44,854
And shine a light on it...

211
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:49,954
That's maybe...

212
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,354
A rabbit!

213
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:55,654
But why is it shadow drawing?

214
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,254
If she made this shape with her fingers,

215
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,554
she could've written words with blood, no?

216
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,254
It's because the woman who was killed

217
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,854
was a nursery school teacher!

218
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,154
Because job-wise

219
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:08,354
they probably show shadow pictures to children.

220
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,354
Even if the culprit were to find it,

221
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,954
it at first doesn't look like a rabbit.

222
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,854
Her hands probably loosened up

223
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:17,854
when she was being carried around.

224
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:22,554
Well, it's no use trying to play dumb!

225
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,154
Being that you inflicted such a wound on the victim's back,

226
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,154
you would've had a lot of her blood splattered on yourself.

227
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:31,554
It seems you changed and washed yourself off with water,

228
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:35,154
you can't erase it that easily.

229
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:39,754
The luminol reaction that detects blood on the body.

230
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:42,754
Then, we should've taken the three to begin,

231
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,854
to the station and investigate them.

232
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:46,554
That would've taken too much time,

233
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,754
and looking for the children would've been delayed, right?

234
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,654
I see.

235
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,254
You're the one, aren't you?

236
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:55,254
That was seen by my friends when you were burying the body

237
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:57,054
and later chased them around?

238
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:59,654
I... It's not me.

239
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:02,854
Huh? You're still going to keep it up?

240
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:05,054
I... I'm not the one to blame.

241
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,554
It's her!

242
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,454
She had the nerve to confine me in a place like that to tease me.

243
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:13,254
She's to blame!

244
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,254
I loved her and yet...

245
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:22,054
We were planning to get married, too.

246
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,054
Why'd she do something like that?

247
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:32,054
She confined you.

248
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,354
I'm claustrophobic.

249
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:37,754
Three year ago,

250
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,354
I once was locked into an elevator the whole day through

251
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,454
because of an accident.

252
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:47,654
Ever since then, I panic whenever I'm in a dark closed place.

253
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:53,254
Yet, she tried to confine me!

254
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:56,254
In the dark mountain, cabin where not even the windows open.

255
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:05,254
Then, the one who wanted to come here was the victim?

256
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:09,654
Yes. I naturally panicked

257
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:12,254
and tried desperately to escape,

258
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:15,254
but the axe in the cabin that I flung around in the dark

259
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:18,254
accidentally slashed her back.

260
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:19,754
That's right.

261
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,454
Only if she didn't do that,

262
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,754
I wouldn't have locked the children in either.

263
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,554
You locked them in the cabin?

264
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,854
Yeah.

265
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:34,854
But I think it's too late already.

266
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:35,954
Don't tell me that

267
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:37,754
he locked them in the mountain cabin and set fire to it?

268
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,554
Inspector Yamamura!

269
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:40,554
We got a report from the search team

270
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:43,254
saying that they found a mountain cabin on fire.

271
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:45,454
And was it extinguished?

272
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:49,654
It seems that when found the cabin was burning out of control.

273
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:51,054
Hey. You folks!

274
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:05,854
No. It can't be...

275
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:09,454
Darn it!

276
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,254
No, no! Don't go near it!

277
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:14,754
Let me go! My friends... my friends are inside!

278
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:16,854
-What? -Let me go!

279
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,354
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

280
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,354
Ai! Ayumi!

281
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:32,554
Yes!

282
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:35,754
Conan! Over here!

283
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:40,254
We're okay, too!

284
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,054
You guys...

285
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:43,654
How on earth did you...

286
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:47,554
A strange lady suddenly appeared and saved us.

287
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,954
She broke the door open with the axe!

288
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:54,154
It seems she was living in the attic of the cabin.

289
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:55,954
Where's Ai?

290
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:59,154
As for Ai, she was the first to be saved,

291
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,954
and was told to escape to a safe place.

292
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,254
I got a call from Ai a while ago,

293
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:07,754
so we know she's safe.

294
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:09,054
That girl...

295
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,154
Don't tell me that she used the antidote.

296
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,554
Which way did that lady go?

297
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,654
She told us to hide until you and the others came

298
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:17,854
and went over that way.

299
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,854
You guys wait there!

300
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:26,954
I'd like to interrogate the children, too.

301
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:30,154
But they may have inhaled smoke,

302
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,654
so we'll have to get a doctor to examine them.

303
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:35,654
Then, please bring them over to the station after that.

304
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,254
Hey, you guys!

305
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:40,754
Do you remember what the lady was like?

306
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:42,554
She was pretty.

307
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:44,954
She looked a bit like Ai, right?

308
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:48,854
That's why I sent the movie that I secretly took!

309
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:50,854
You sent a movie?

310
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,254
Yes.

311
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:55,154
I wanted to thank her later,

312
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,854
so I sent it to the Mouri Detective Agency,

313
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:59,154
to have them find her.

314
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:03,154
I promised to send them pictures of the camp to begin with, anyway.

315
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:06,354
See, this is her!

316
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:08,054
But we may be able to see her next week

317
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,854
even if we don't look for her.

318
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,354
Because she...

319
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:15,354
Ai! Where are you?

320
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:16,654
Ai!

321
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,354
You're late.

322
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,554
I believed that "you know who"

323
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:27,554
was going to come to rescue us and yet...

324
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:30,454
I didn't think that I would end up having to drink that antidote

325
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:33,554
to return to my former size.

326
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:36,354
Where'd you get those clothes?

327
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:37,854
I borrowed the clothes

328
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:41,254
that I found in the cabin of the woman that killed!

329
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:45,554
I couldn't go out in front of the children stark naked.

330
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:48,354
Well, but since my body grew,

331
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:50,554
I couldn't remove this ring.

332
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,954
As for the clothes, I got to change everything.

333
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:58,754
I hope the children haven't noticed that I'm Ai Haibara.

334
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,454
Okay then, why don't you hide in the tent

335
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,954
until the drug wears off?

336
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:06,754
They're going to be interrogated.

337
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:11,054
By the way, you did catch the murderer?

338
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:14,454
Yes. It was the photographer.

339
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,754
I realized it when I saw her dying message.

340
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,654
He's claustrophobic,

341
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:23,454
and he said he was almost locked up in the cabin.

342
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:27,454
I get it. It matches.

343
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:30,554
In her bag with her clothes,

344
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:33,854
there was a book about claustrophobia.

345
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:36,654
She was trying help him overcome the phobia

346
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,554
by taking him into that cabin,

347
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,954
and staying with him throughout the night.

348
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:43,854
But that kind of drastic measure backfired.

349
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,954
He panicked,

350
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,754
and unfortunately she was murdered.

351
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,754
What a story about an unwanted noble gesture.

352
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:56,354
That type of phobia doesn't have to be cured to lead a normal life.

353
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:59,954
It might have been because he was a photographer.

354
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:03,854
If he was using a film type camera

355
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,854
and if he can't handle being in a small dark room,

356
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:09,954
for a photographer that could ruin him.

357
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:13,254
She probably wanted him to be his old self again.

358
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:18,354
Didn't she leave evidence that he was the killer?

359
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:20,254
She was holding a grudge against him.

360
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:21,454
No.

361
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,254
If that's so, it wasn't her dying message.

362
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:29,654
Maybe she just wanted to die hugging it.

363
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:33,654
A rabbit, the form of the person she loved the most.

364
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:05,354
So, those kids are staying at an Inn in Gunma tonight?

365
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:08,954
Yep, the camp grounds are still scary.

366
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:12,354
By the way, they sure get involved in many cases.

367
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:14,554
Hey? Just now, something...

368
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:16,554
It sounded like a sound came from downstairs.

369
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:18,354
It's the wind, the wind!

370
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:20,054
It was pretty strong today.

371
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:26,854
Password...

372
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:29,954
How are both of your passwords?

373
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:32,454
My birthday.

374
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:36,054
Mine's "KOGOROSAN", 5563.

375
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,854
I meant...

376
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,754
if it's a very long password and you couldn't memorize it...

377
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:44,254
5563...

378
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:49,354
What was received weren't pictures... a movie?

379
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:01,154
All right now. Until your friends arrive,

380
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:03,154
keep quiet and out of sight.

381
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:12,754
Mystery Train pass ring...

382
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:15,954
Bell Tree Express.

383
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:21,854
I'm being hacked.

384
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:23,254
Who is it?

385
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,280
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,560
"Missing Carriage 7"
