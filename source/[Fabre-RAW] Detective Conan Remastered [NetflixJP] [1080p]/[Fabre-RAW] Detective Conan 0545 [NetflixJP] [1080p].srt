1
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,544
Oh, no.

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,744
The fog's getting thicker.

3
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:15,995
True.

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,644
I can virtually only slightly see the guardrail,

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,001
and I can't see the mountains in the distance or anything for that matter.

6
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,003
It can't be helped.

7
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,444
I saw on TV that at this time of the year,

8
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:29,544
Mt. Fyuna is enveloped in thick fog

9
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:32,344
because of something involving the temperature and humidity.

10
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:34,013
TV again?

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,015
Study a little more.

12
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,544
He is!

13
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:40,844
Conan's tests all score 100!

14
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,021
Right?

15
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,344
Of course.

16
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,344
Because inside, I'm an 11th grader.

17
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:49,644
If I knew things were going to turn out this way,

18
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:53,244
we shouldn't have had dinner at the client's house.

19
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:56,644
I wasn't counting on spending the night there and leaving in the morning.

20
00:00:56,644 --> 00:01:01,144
It's because you drank too much and got drunk, isn't it, Dad?

21
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,544
Well, since you both got school today,

22
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:05,144
I'll get you home even if I have to speed back.

23
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:08,047
Speed... speed through this fog?

24
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:09,844
Don't worry.

25
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:13,344
There's nobody driving through a fog like this,

26
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:16,055
so there's no worry of on-coming traffic either.

27
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:20,344
But I don't think you should speed.

28
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:22,344
See, over there!

29
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:24,063
What? A checkpoint?

30
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,744
Your license, please.

31
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:33,044
Is anything wrong?

32
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:34,644
Okay...

33
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:38,844
You can let male drivers through.

34
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:42,344
Because after all, we're trying arrest...

35
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:44,344
a witch!

36
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,444
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,344
You're Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police Department!

38
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,844
It's you, Mr. Mouri!

39
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:55,844
It's been such a long hula-hula time!

40
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:57,844
Come off that hula-hula stuff.

41
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:01,844
What brings you to a place like this, Officer Yamamura?

42
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:06,105
Come on. Did you forget, Ran?

43
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,244
I'm no longer an ordinary officer.

44
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:10,544
I'm an inspector!

45
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:13,644
Please call me Inspector Yamamura!

46
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:16,115
Are they going to be okay? The Gunma Prefectural Police.

47
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:22,121
And? Was there a homicide or something, Detective Yamamura?

48
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:30,644
Inspector Yamamura.

49
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:32,944
In fact, I have a very important duty to carry out!

50
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,944
Important duty?

51
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,744
I'm on a witch hunt,

52
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:38,544
hunting for a witch!

53
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,144
Witch... witch hunt?

54
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,744
Witch?

55
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,145
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

56
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,744
Saturday nights are for mystery.

57
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:50,149
What is the true identity of the eerie woman

58
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,644
who appears in the foggy ridge?

59
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:54,153
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,155
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,157
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

62
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,860
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 1)".

63
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,960
Just what do you mean by witch hunt?

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,269
Haven't you ever heard about it, Mr. Mouri?

65
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,660
About the legendary woman driver

66
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,860
that was boisterously going around here

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,260
in Mt. Fuyuna about four years ago.

68
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,860
Legendary woman driver?

69
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,281
You know that this place is the Holy Land for street racers, don't you?

70
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,860
It's said that just as the street racers finished their race

71
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,060
and were starting to head home,

72
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,760
she suddenly appeared from within the fog

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,360
and outraced all of them.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Together with the unique sound of the exhaust

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,295
and tires rubbing against the road,

76
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:20,860
they say it really sounded like a woman was closing in while screaming.

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,360
She was therefore, nicknamed The Silver-white Witch of Mt. Fuyuna!

78
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,307
Silver-white Witch?

79
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,560
Why Silver-white?

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,160
It seems it was because the car that the witch was driving was a white FD.

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,860
But how can people tell that she was a woman?

82
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,319
Could they see her?

83
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,960
There was car that spun when battling with her car.

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,760
At that time, she came out of her car

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,327
and asked the driver, "Are you all right?"

86
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,860
It's said that she was a super beauty!

87
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,060
And? Why are you trying to arrest her?

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,341
Well, the witch recently appeared again

89
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:06,860
challenging the street racers, causing a series of car accidents.

90
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,960
The other day,

91
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
a racer crashed through the guardrail,

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,060
fell over and is in critical condition now.

93
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,560
Hold on!

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Why are investigators from the crime unit handling this?

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,660
Traffic accident should be handled by the traffic department.

96
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,960
I encountered that witch too!

97
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,860
No joke?

98
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,660
I was asked by one of my superiors to go get the car

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
that he used to stake out with.

100
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,371
When I was driving the car,

101
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:36,375
the witch's car came out of the fog!

102
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,760
How did you know she was a witch?

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,379
Her hand.

104
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,160
The hand that came out of the car was so witchy.

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Witchy? Weren't you driving the car?

106
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,389
Well, to be exact,

107
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,391
it was my grandmother.

108
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,393
She came out from the country

109
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,860
and I went to pick her up at the station with the car.

110
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,760
Then she told me that she'd drive for me,

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,399
since I'm tired from work,

112
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,960
so to go to sleep in the passenger's seat.

113
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,403
And?

114
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,160
Don't tell me that your granny battled with that witch.

115
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,860
Of course, she went all out!

116
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,960
Granny loves the F-1 races and car chase movies!

117
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
But she gave up part way.

118
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,460
Her opponent is superhuman.

119
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,160
She said she didn't stand a chance.

120
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,760
Super human?

121
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,960
Yes, that's what granny said.

122
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,160
She said that car, like a superhuman,

123
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,160
sped over the fog where there was no street.

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
Over... over the fog?

125
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,960
Yes. Granny said she thought it strange,

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
stopped the car and got out.

127
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,660
That person also got off the car and was standing on the fog.

128
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
When granny waved her hand,

129
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,447
she said that the woman also waved back.

130
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Do you expect us to believe a story like that?

131
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,760
I guess not.

132
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,960
That's why after I'm finished with the work of the first precinct,

133
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,461
I'm helping out at this checkpoint over here, you see.

134
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:08,467
Well, it seems she only appears early in the morning when the fog is thick,

135
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:12,060
so I do this only on my days off.

136
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,460
My next day off is...

137
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,260
next Saturday.

138
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Would you like me to help you too?

139
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,860
It's okay! Because granny could've seen wrong.

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,483
And no matter how famed a detective you are,

141
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:28,160
you could probably never catch a witch that walks on fog, right?

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,560
Maybe she'll come again to see me

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,660
because I've got a pure heart.

144
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,360
Is that so?

145
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,960
The Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna Pass?

146
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,501
I know! I know!

147
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,360
I heard that she recently appeared again,

148
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,860
but what about her, Ran?

149
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,060
The fact is

150
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,260
Dad is all out to catch the witch.

151
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,160
A white FD! FD!

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,860
He's calling all his friends who are driving,

153
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,160
but all he knows is that the driver is a woman driving a white FD.

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,660
I thought that maybe since you're in the transportation division,

155
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,060
you might know something more, Yumi.

156
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,535
My jurisdiction is Tokyo, so...

157
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,537
Do you know anything, Miwako?

158
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:22,541
A woman street racer who rides a white FD.

159
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm not too keen with cars, so...

160
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,547
The car I'm riding now is a hand-me-down of my father's too.

161
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,060
I thought so.

162
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm sorry, Ran,

163
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,660
that I'm of no help.

164
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,260
FD... I wonder if it's a foreign car?

165
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,660
Hey, Dad, let's go home already.

166
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,860
We've made two round trips already.

167
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,360
You idiot!

168
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,660
I rented a Lancer Evolution, just to hunt the witch!

169
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,760
I can't quit now!

170
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,960
But, if she's really a witch, I'm scared.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,660
I told you not to come along, didn't I?

172
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,560
But Conan...

173
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,583
I wanted to see the witch!

174
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Today is Saturday, so there's no school either.

175
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,460
But since she's not appearing

176
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,160
even if we're running around like this,

177
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,560
maybe she's taking time off too.

178
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,860
Darn, I guess there's nothing that can be done.

179
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,160
Let's head on home.

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Come on, Ran, what's with that weird voice?

181
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm not speeding all that much.

182
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,605
It's not me! I didn't say anything.

183
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,060
Is it the sound of tires?

184
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,360
Tires rubbing against the ground that sound like a woman's scream.

185
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,860
Besides, response that seems to bust out at once to the red zone.

186
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,960
A unique sound of the engine

187
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,160
that sounds like the shrill voice of a woman.

188
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
Don't tell me that...

189
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,460
Hey, Ran! Look behind!

190
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
-Is something coming? -Behind?

191
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,260
No.

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,260
Pops, beside you, beside you.

193
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,160
It... it's coming!

194
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,645
The white FD!

195
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,651
Sign of battle?

196
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,360
Just great!

197
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,655
Wanna have it out with me?

198
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,660
No, Dad, don't!

199
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,760
Shut up!

200
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,060
I'm not going to cop out from somebody picking a fight with me!

201
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,060
I'll take you on!

202
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,460
She's already so far away.

203
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,660
Darn!

204
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,160
Another curve!

205
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,689
You're not getting away!

206
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,060
Pops! Stop! The brakes! Quick!

207
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,660
Stop.

208
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,760
Just what do you think you're doing?

209
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,721
Pops, which way were thinking of turning just now?

210
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,360
Left, you hear left!

211
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,725
Because that car turned left.

212
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,460
But Pops,

213
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,160
there's no road to the left.

214
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,460
What?

215
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,060
Don't... don't be ridiculous!

216
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,160
I'm sure that the car went left.

217
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,741
What the hell's going on?

218
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,660
A witch that speeds over the fog of Fuyuna Pass.

219
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,860
Very interesting!

220
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,399
Really?

221
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,761
Maybe you saw wrong, Dad?

222
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,299
No, I didn't see wrong.

223
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,765
The white FD turned left

224
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,299
and sped over the fog.

225
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,771
The red tail lights of that car tilted for a second.

226
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,899
I saw it turn the left curve with my very eyes.

227
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,999
I didn't see wrong!

228
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,499
I saw it too.

229
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,799
I heard the sound of the tires at the curve too.

230
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,783
The guardrail was closing in in a strange way,

231
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,799
so I pulled the side brakes and stopped the car but...

232
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,399
Then, it's the witch after all!

233
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,299
She was probably using some kind of frightening witchcraft

234
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:33,799
to ride above the fog,

235
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,299
and lured us so that our car would get into an accident!

236
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,797
Inspector Yamamura's grandmother

237
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,801
seems to have seen that person stand on the fog too.

238
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,599
The hand that came out of that car

239
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:47,699
was really witchy and felt eerie.

240
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,199
Maybe it's true

241
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,811
that the car is something we humans shouldn't be meddling with.

242
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,199
Two people.

243
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,999
There were two people inside that car, weren't there?

244
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,199
You... you mean you saw inside the car?

245
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,823
I couldn't but you can tell, can't you?

246
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,999
That FD is a Japanese car, but the steering wheel is on the left.

247
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,899
The driver couldn't possibly stick his arm out the passenger's seat, right?

248
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:15,999
But if she's a witch, she could stretch her arm.

249
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,839
Then, why don't you ask him, Inspector Yamamura, to check it out?

250
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,399
Why do you have to bring out the name of that klutz?

251
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,999
Because he said he was going to be

252
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,499
at this checkpoint again this Saturday, right?

253
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,599
If you call him right away,

254
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,999
he may be able to stop that car, right?

255
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:33,599
True.

256
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,799
The model is a FD and the color is white.

257
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,599
If more than two people are riding,

258
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,599
the targets narrowed down quite a bit.

259
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,399
Let's not!

260
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,861
If we go after her

261
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,499
and she casts a spell on us or something,

262
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,599
what are you going to do?

263
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,399
Don't worry!

264
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,899
Speeding the car over the fog

265
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,899
and standing on the fog

266
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,899
are both things that can be proven logically.

267
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,899
The only place that witches and curses exist in this world

268
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,399
are only in fantasy stories.

269
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,299
Conan.

270
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,999
I mean, I'm sure Shinichi would say something like that.

271
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,299
I guess so.

272
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:14,893
Stop the white FD that has more than two people riding in it?

273
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:19,299
We are checking every white FD that we see.

274
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,299
But since none look suspicious, we're letting them through.

275
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:23,999
Letting them through?

276
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,299
You mean you saw a white FD?

277
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,899
Yes, about five of them.

278
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,999
What? Five?

279
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:33,999
All of them seem to like the Silver-white Witch.

280
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,799
White FDs seem to be very popular now.

281
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,917
But, don't worry.

282
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:41,299
We only let the male drivers through,

283
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,699
and no women have come by yet.

284
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:44,923
You idiot!

285
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,925
Stop the men too!

286
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,499
The woman that got off the witch's car four years ago,

287
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:54,499
may have just happened to be riding the car!

288
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:59,199
Anyway, stop all the white FDs that come by until I get there!

289
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,939
Judging from the location of that checkpoint,

290
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,899
I'm sure that the witch hasn't passed by yet!

291
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:04,943
Okay.

292
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,599
"Checkpoint"

293
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,399
So these three are the three white FDs

294
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,399
that got stopped at the checkpoint after I called?

295
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,599
Yes, all three had two people inside.

296
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,959
Well, I'm sure that the last car that was stopped at the checkpoint

297
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,399
is the witch's car.

298
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,965
I haven't overtaken any other cars.

299
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:30,099
But I don't think the order they came in is reliable.

300
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:31,299
The only car that came directly here

301
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,599
without stopping over anywhere is this car.

302
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,799
The other two cars stopped over partway

303
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,699
and were overtaken by several cars.

304
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,799
Come to think of it,

305
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,983
several cars went by

306
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,985
when Dad was on the phone with Inspector Yamamura.

307
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
Which means, we can't tell

308
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,599
whether the FD is the witch's judging just by the order in which they came.

309
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,993
Well, I did try asking,

310
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,999
but there seems to be no witch among them.

311
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,999
What did you ask?

312
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,399
Of course, I asked, "Are you a witch?"

313
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,599
What a dope.

314
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,007
Why don't you ask them too, Pops?

315
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,799
After all, we did see the witch's hand.

316
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,299
Yeah, true.

317
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,199
And? Who came first?

318
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,799
That FD with two men inside.

319
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,399
"Raito Egashira (25)" -How rude!

320
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,499
We're telling you we're not warlocks!

321
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,799
"Akira Mafune (26)" -Well, it's true that we're riding a white FD

322
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,399
thanks to her, though.

323
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:31,799
Speeding through this pass is easy when riding this FD, so...

324
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,399
Speeding through is easy?

325
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:37,299
Because the mediocre street racers all panic and make way for us.

326
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,037
Excuse me.

327
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,099
Were you guys going fishing?

328
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,699
See! The things in the backseat, aren't they fishing equipment?

329
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,999
Yeah, because we get to fish for black bass in Lake Fuyuna.

330
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,599
Will you show me that rod?

331
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,499
Okay, but don't break it,

332
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,499
because it's a good rod.

333
00:17:58,499 --> 00:17:59,499
Here.

334
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,899
It sure is a good rod.

335
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:07,999
And? Is it really true

336
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,499
that you didn't overtake anyone until you came here?

337
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:15,099
Yeah, because he was at the wheels today.

338
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,077
He may not look it, but he's a safe driver.

339
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,299
Shut up.

340
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,999
Hey.

341
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,799
You're sure wearing some ring.

342
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,087
Yeah. Thanks to it, when I tried to fasten my seatbelt, it got stuck

343
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,089
and I'm still bleeding.

344
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,299
Come to think of it,

345
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,093
I think the witch was also wearing a ring like this.

346
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,199
Really?

347
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:41,099
The reason I'm driving a white FD?

348
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,299
"Rumi Hando (23)" -Why else? Because I adore the witch!

349
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,699
"Haruka Kawai (24)" -She's charismatic, that's why!

350
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:50,899
And? It seems that somebody overtook you on your way here?

351
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:54,799
Yeah, I got a call while I was driving,

352
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,099
so I pulled over to the side.

353
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,399
And that's when two to three cars overtook me.

354
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:01,119
Were they white FDs?

355
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,699
Well, I don't remember.

356
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,799
There was a thick fog too.

357
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,399
Was that call by any chance from one of your golfing friends?

358
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,399
Yeah.

359
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,199
Who's this boy?

360
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:15,133
Because there are three golf bags inside.

361
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,799
That's why I thought so.

362
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,899
I'm asking you, who's he?

363
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,599
Well, this boy is...

364
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,699
Huh, what happened to your fake nail?

365
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,145
Your middle fingernail is gone.

366
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,599
When I shifted gears a while ago,

367
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,199
it got stuck and disappeared.

368
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:35,153
Come to think of it, the nails of a witch are also long.

369
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:37,899
Look closely!

370
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,799
Haruka's is pink!

371
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,999
Don't witches have black nails?

372
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:46,899
By the way, is it okay to check inside your golf bags?

373
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,599
Yes, go ahead.

374
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,399
"Jinya Enda (31)" -You mean the witch that frequently appears here

375
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,699
is riding a white FD?

376
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,499
"Yasue Taira (28)" -I didn't know.

377
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:00,599
I'm just driving this because I like the color white,

378
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,099
as well as the wave-like design.

379
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:08,199
Were you overtaken by another white FD?

380
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,899
Out of all the three FDs,

381
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:13,191
yours was checked the last, right?

382
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:18,899
Yes, I was buying canned coffee along the way, when I was overtaken,

383
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,299
but I don't remember what model car it was.

384
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,499
While drinking coffee in the car,

385
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:26,899
we were all talking excitedly about Lakeside Park where we were headed.

386
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,099
That's why you brought along floats and rubber boats?

387
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,209
Right.

388
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:35,599
We can use boats, go rafting and play at the pool there, you see.

389
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,899
But if you bloat it up like this in the car,

390
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:40,399
you can't get it out, can you?

391
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,899
She told me so just a while ago too.

392
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,599
She said for me to put air in it after we reached our destination.

393
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,699
Which means that you were the one driving, miss?

394
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,099
Yes.

395
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,229
I was sitting in the passenger's seat

396
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,499
and navigating her while looking at the map.

397
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,299
What the...

398
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,899
A little too plum for a witch.

399
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:03,241
Well, we'd like to check your rubber boat and float for now then.

400
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,899
Hey, Misao.

401
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,245
Granny!

402
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,499
"Misae Yamamura, Yamamura's Grandmother" -I told you to stay in the car.

403
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:13,251
You... you brought your grandmother along?

404
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,199
Yes.

405
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,499
She wouldn't listen to me saying that

406
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:19,599
she would be able to recognize the witch she saw back then.

407
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,261
Well, she isn't in there.

408
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,699
How do you know that she's not there?

409
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,999
Well, because back then,

410
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:33,599
the one who got off the car on top of the fog and waved back at me

411
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,899
had a halo around her.

412
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,699
She looked more like a goddess than a witch to me.

413
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,281
They don't have halos around them, do they?

414
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,299
What's with that old lady?

415
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,285
Granny!

416
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:51,289
I... I guess you can leave for today.

417
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,799
If we need anything more,

418
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,899
we'll call you from the station.

419
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,399
Silver-white Witch.

420
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:00,499
The legendary witch driver who street raced

421
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:02,699
all over Mt. Fuyuna four years ago.

422
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,599
Driving on the fog.

423
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,899
Standing on the fog and waving her hand.

424
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,599
What kind of trick did she use anyway?

425
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,199
Can somebody really do something like that?

426
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:20,599
There are three pairs of suspicious drivers.

427
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,799
Mr. Raito Egashira and Akira Mabune.

428
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,599
Ms. Rumi Hando and Ms. Haruka Kawai.

429
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,699
Mr. Jinya Enda and Ms. Yasue Taira.

430
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:35,333
Just wait and see, Silver-white Witch.

431
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:39,337
I'll disclose your true identity for sure!

432
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,820
"Mirage".

434
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,994
Shinichi is over there!

435
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:09,427
That's only a mirage!

436
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,560
Because you see, I'm right here.
