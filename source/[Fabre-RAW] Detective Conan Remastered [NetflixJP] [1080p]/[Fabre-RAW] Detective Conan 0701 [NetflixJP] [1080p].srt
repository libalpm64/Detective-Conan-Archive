1
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:11,456
Mystery train?

2
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:13,556
The Bell Tree Express?

3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,995
It's unthinkable that Sherry would ever ride

4
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:17,756
such a flashy idiotic train like that, though.

5
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:22,001
Oh, maybe that's the very reason why she chose it, right?

6
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
The compartments in that train are all single and private.

7
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,005
I don't think that there's a more suitable way to divert

8
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,656
the Organization's eyes

9
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:30,556
and flee from the Kanto district, don't you?

10
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:33,056
But, it really is hard to believe

11
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:34,956
that Sherry was living in hiding in

12
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,156
-a remote mountain area in Gunma. -Yes.

13
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:39,156
Bourbon who got that information

14
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:40,656
also feels the same.

15
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:44,023
Because she just happened to tell a third party

16
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,756
that she coincidentally ran into about it,

17
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:48,027
so it may not be too reliable.

18
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:51,056
But, if Sherry were to be on that train,

19
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:53,756
wouldn't it make a great hunting ground?

20
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:54,756
Yeah.

21
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:59,056
If we can only keep her from getting off part way.

22
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:00,456
It's a moving steel prison.

23
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,356
We can corner her with terror as if hunting down deer,

24
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:04,043
then, I'm sure she'll expose herself from her side

25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,045
before the gun.

26
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,356
I hope you understand why I went out of the way

27
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:10,756
to leak this information to you?

28
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:12,356
You don't want me to do anything

29
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:15,656
until the iron snake returns to its nest, right?

30
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:19,056
Well, I'm sure happy to hear about Sherry from your side,

31
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,956
after such a long time

32
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,456
I was worried maybe you two were getting into some girl talk

33
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,456
and you were showing mercy for her or something so...

34
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:30,856
How stupid. Just who do you think I am?

35
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,356
At any rate,

36
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:36,075
I'll contact you again after the hunt is over.

37
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,856
Yeah.

38
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:40,756
Okay.

39
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,856
You win.

40
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:46,956
I'll forget about Sherry.

41
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:51,856
But...

42
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:56,095
I'm not the one who's going to do it,

43
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,097
Bourbon is.

44
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,456
She's one person

45
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:04,556
that shouldn't be on this planet.

46
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,856
No offense.

47
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,109
Silver Bullet.

48
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:14,756
Aim for a 100% solution.

49
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:17,056
Clear all mysteries and codes.

50
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,856
The shadow of the Organization closes in on Haibara.

51
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,856
The departure bell echoes throughout.

52
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,121
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,123
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:27,356
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,950
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Departure)"

56
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,450
"Tokyo Station"

57
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,750
Fantastic!

58
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,241
This is the first time I've seem a locomotive!

59
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,450
Me too!

60
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,550
It sure is magnificent!

61
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,247
Well, it just looks to be a steam locomotive on the outside.

62
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,650
The inside looks to be

63
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,250
a state-of-the-art diesel locomotive, though.

64
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,255
Ai, you still have a cold?

65
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,150
Yes.

66
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,050
You know whose virus is so persistent, you see.

67
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,950
If so, you should've stayed in bed at home.

68
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,850
Hey, you kids!

69
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,750
You'd better be grateful to the owner

70
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,650
of the Bell Tree Express, the Suzuki Financial Group!

71
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,271
I specially reserved seats for you guys, get that?

72
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,850
Yes, Ma'am!

73
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,250
Well, unlike you guys,

74
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,850
we're sitting in a sparkling first class car, though.

75
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,350
Come to think of it, it's the first class car, isn't it?

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,850
That Kid said that he be coming after next time, right?

77
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,550
That's right!

78
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,150
This train usually only runs once a year,

79
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,293
but when Uncle Jirokichi announced that

80
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,295
he would specially run it and display a gem

81
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,550
called whatever,

82
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,950
Kid got super interested and...

83
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,950
That's why I decided to

84
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,301
get on board beforehand this time,

85
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,950
write him a love letter

86
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,550
and hide it in the train. What do you think?

87
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,750
I wonder.

88
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,550
I don't think that Kid would have the time

89
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,250
to get the letter though.

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,850
Rather, Kyogoku will get angry at you, you know.

91
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,550
My love for Kid is a different story.

92
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,250
More than a thief like him, I'm more concerned

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,350
about the deduction quiz that

94
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,750
they always have in the train!

95
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,750
Sera? What brings you here?

96
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,950
You're here?

97
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,850
I'm a detective! It's only natural for me to be on board.

98
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,750
Isn't your Daddy with you?

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,337
Huh? He was here till just a while ago.

100
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,550
Well, if it isn't you, Mr. Ando... Long time no see.

101
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,250
Shall I take your bags for you?

102
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,350
No, thank you.

103
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,350
It's an important thing that

104
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,950
a client asked me to carry for him,

105
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,050
and, it's pretty heavy too.

106
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,050
Well, the only thing that's heavy

107
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,050
is the genuine gold frame though.

108
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,550
The artwork itself is fake.

109
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,850
Since it has already been appraised,

110
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,850
I'm taking it to a client in Nagoya.

111
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,363
Huh? This is a mystery train that's headed for

112
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,150
an unknown destination, you know?

113
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,050
Why are you sure it'll go to Nagoya?

114
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,150
Hey.

115
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,373
Conductor, how many years have you known us already?

116
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,050
If we check which train has a change

117
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,050
in time schedule today,

118
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,050
it wouldn't be difficult to figure it out, no?

119
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,381
Oh.

120
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,383
The target of our intellectual excitement

121
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,950
lies only in the mystery that occurs on board this train.

122
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,750
Isn't that right, Ms. Sumitomo?

123
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,850
Yes, Ma'am.

124
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,950
Just as would be expected of all you, mystery lovers.

125
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,150
I'm sorry to have under estimated you.

126
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,850
Hey, you!

127
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,950
What on earth's going on?

128
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,750
I reserved the same room as I always do,

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,850
in the 8th car

130
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,950
where the first class rooms are,

131
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,950
but why has my room been changed to the 7th car?

132
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,750
I'm very sorry.

133
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,150
We already informed you of that the other day.

134
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,415
Due to careless oversight on our part,

135
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,750
there's been an overbooking.

136
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,419
Therefore, we had no choice

137
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,850
but to change your room.

138
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,550
That room's been a favorite of mine

139
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,950
and I've been reserving it every year

140
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,425
since tickets have first been issued.

141
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,050
Who the heck came in between and took the room?

142
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,431
It's me over here.

143
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,750
Well, I'm so very sorry.

144
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,150
My daughter happens to be friends with the owner of this train.

145
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,750
Well, no need for worry since I am on board.

146
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,445
No matter what may happen on this train...

147
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,449
I, the renown detective, Poirot Mouri

148
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,950
will solve the case in the wink of an eye.

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,150
Hey, Dad! Just what do you think you're doing!

150
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,850
Nothing, I was just introducing myself

151
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,250
to the people that are staying in car 8 with me.

152
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,150
It's no smoking here.

153
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,450
What's with you? Calling yourself "Poirot"?

154
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,450
You're Kogoro Mouri, aren't you, Dad?

155
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,750
-Oh, you heard me? -Come on!

156
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,150
Everybody's waiting for you in front of car 6

157
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,750
to take pictures together, before the train starts off.

158
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,150
Oh, is that right?

159
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,550
What's this tense atmosphere all about?

160
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,950
Is it because they all found out that Pops is a detective?

161
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,550
Or...

162
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,850
Wow! That's awesome!

163
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,150
It's passing all the stations!

164
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,250
I hear that this train virtually won't stop

165
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,050
until it reaches its destination.

166
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,529
No joke!

167
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,750
Well, it's a mystery where the final destination is, though.

168
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,850
It's Nagoya.

169
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,850
If you check the service status on the web,

170
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,950
you can more or less make out the service planning diagram.

171
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,950
What a boring thing to say when after all,

172
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,550
we're all on board a mystery train.

173
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,850
More than that, what bothers me is,

174
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,250
the deduction quiz that is given out

175
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,450
during the time this train is running.

176
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,050
Rumor has it that the culprit and victim

177
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,450
will be picked out at random

178
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,950
from among the passengers of the train,

179
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,350
and an incident occurs.

180
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,559
All the other remaining passengers become detectives,

181
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,350
and by the time the train reaches its final destination,

182
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,750
it seems that the culprit has to be disclosed.

183
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,150
Yes! What is it?

184
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,250
Huh?

185
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,950
No one's here.

186
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,550
Huh? A letter?

187
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,550
Congratulations.

188
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,850
You've been chosen to play the role of the detective!

189
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,583
An incident will occur

190
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,585
in room B of car 7 in 10 minutes

191
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,587
so go and investigate.

192
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,850
Aren't all the passengers supposed to be detectives?

193
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,150
Room B of car 7...

194
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,597
Here it is! It's this room!

195
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,050
Excuse me.

196
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,601
I'm coming in.

197
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,950
Idiot! Don't come in!

198
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,609
Wow, looks real!

199
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,611
-Let's go after him. -Aye!

200
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,950
Come on, Conan and Ai too!

201
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,550
Rather than being a mystery...

202
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,050
This is just a game of tag.

203
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,633
Darn, we've lost track.

204
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,635
It's full of private rooms,

205
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,637
so it's hard to find him once he goes into a room.

206
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,950
Children?

207
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,650
Is this the first time you've all boarded this train?

208
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,650
Yes.

209
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,150
Then, I think you should stay in your room.

210
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,950
Because the deduction quiz for this time

211
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,150
will be announced from the speaker in your room.

212
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,050
Huh? Hasn't the incident or anything happened yet?

213
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,150
No.

214
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,657
I think it'll be in an hour or so this time.

215
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,150
Then, don't tell me that what happened a while ago is...

216
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,661
Hey, Conan?

217
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,250
Please wait!

218
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,350
-Ai, come on! -Okay.

219
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,150
Ai?

220
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,350
Come on, Ai, let's go.

221
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,350
It can't be...

222
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,950
Oh, Conan, what's the matter?

223
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,650
At least knock when you enter a lady's room!

224
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,650
Oh, no...

225
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,713
This is car number 7, right?

226
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,750
Just what are you talking about? This is car number 8!

227
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,150
I just came over a while ago!

228
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,729
Strange. I don't think I miscounted the cars and yet...

229
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,350
It can't be helped.

230
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,350
Because the car numbers

231
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,250
are written only on the body of the train,

232
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,750
and moreover, the only thing written on the door

233
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,050
of the rooms is one letter of the alphabet.

234
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,743
How'd you do on the deduction quiz?

235
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:49,050
Doc. Is that room, our room in car number 6?

236
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,450
Huh? Yeah. See.

237
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,850
The snacks that you've all been eating till a while ago,

238
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,050
are still there too.

239
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,755
Hey, Conan.

240
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,050
Something's strange?

241
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,250
We only moved one car from car number 8 and yet...

242
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,250
Car number 7...

243
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,950
You mean, car number 7...

244
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,767
disappeared while the train was running?

245
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,781
Car number 7 disappeared?

246
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,694
That's ridiculous.

247
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,594
It was in car number 7 a while ago,

248
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,594
where the man who was shot was.

249
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:31,094
And we went after the culprit who shot the man,

250
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:34,094
but lost track of him.

251
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:37,194
When we returned to car number 7 where the passenger was shot,

252
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:38,797
it happened to be car number 8!

253
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,294
Shot?

254
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:45,694
Then why didn't you tell us conductors about it right away?

255
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:48,807
We thought that it was the deduction quiz back then!

256
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,094
At any rate, please confirm!

257
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:53,094
Because car number 7 disappeared

258
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,294
along with the passenger who was shot!

259
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:59,394
If so, it's best to ask the conductors who are in each car.

260
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:01,394
They are seated like I am,

261
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:04,394
at the rear end of the corridor of the passengers' room.

262
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:08,094
Well, I'm sure that you're mistaken, though.

263
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,294
Because of the intention of the owner of this train,

264
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:11,694
the car numbers aren't displayed

265
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,194
on the inside of the train, so...

266
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:15,394
The owner's intention?

267
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:18,594
Because of this, many passengers

268
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,294
who lose track of where their rooms are,

269
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,594
keep us conductors really busy.

270
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:28,847
Excuse me. May I help you?

271
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,494
So, when the bell is rung

272
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,094
and the light of the room turns on,

273
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:33,994
the conductor comes to the room!

274
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:36,855
Wow! I'm going to give it a try later on too!

275
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,194
Right now, our priority is to find car number 7 that disappeared!

276
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,994
-Let's go confirm! -Aye!

277
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:48,867
Ai, are you feeling bad because of your cold?

278
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,194
I'm fine because I drank medicine.

279
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:54,194
Okay, let's go then!

280
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,879
That man just now resembled that person.

281
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,294
But, that burn...

282
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,894
what's going on?

283
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,294
Car number 7?

284
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:10,194
Is this really car number 7?

285
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,494
Yeah.

286
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,694
Car number 7 has returned!

287
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:15,994
But, how?

288
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,294
Let's go back to room B once more then.

289
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,899
Yeah.

290
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:27,594
I'm going to open the door.

291
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,694
Huh?

292
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:33,394
You know what...

293
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:34,694
Is this really...

294
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,915
I said it's car number 8, didn't I?

295
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:40,919
Go back to your room brat, and stay there!

296
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,594
Just what is going on...

297
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:45,394
I wonder if that conductor's making a mistake.

298
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:49,294
Could be... He kind of looked sleepy too, so, you know.

299
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:51,494
Wait a sec...

300
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:53,394
If I remember correctly, at first...

301
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,394
That's...

302
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:06,694
Hey, you.

303
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,694
You know, this room...

304
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:13,494
is really actually room B of car number 7.

305
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:14,594
Right?

306
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:16,494
Like I've been trying to tell you...

307
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:19,894
You received it too, didn't you, Sonoko?

308
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,094
A card that looks like this.

309
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:25,394
And you did as was instructed on the card, right?

310
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,694
It told you to change rooms temporarily

311
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,794
with the person playing the role of the victim

312
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:33,594
in order to confuse the detectives that came to this room.

313
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,594
Am I wrong?

314
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,994
Wow! Just as would be expected of you, Conan!

315
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,494
Correct!

316
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:42,494
Somebody knocked on the door, and when I opened it,

317
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:44,294
an envelope was on the floor.

318
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,294
This is what was written on the card.

319
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:51,494
"Congratulations, you've been chosen as the accomplice!"

320
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:53,794
The rest is just as you said, Conan.

321
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:54,993
We were instructed to liven up the deduction quiz

322
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,694
by switching rooms with the person playing

323
00:16:57,694 --> 00:17:00,994
the role of the victim in room B of car number 7!

324
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:03,594
Angry at me for being correct, eh.

325
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:05,994
And, I happened to pass by

326
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:08,094
just when the person playing the role of the victim

327
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:12,094
was switching rooms with them, so I joined them!

328
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:14,694
So, I'm sure the person playing the role of the victim

329
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:17,294
is relaxing in car number 8 now.

330
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:19,017
Then, where's Pops?

331
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:21,394
He went to the dining room after being told to do so,

332
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,694
by the person playing the victim!

333
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,494
The dining room?

334
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,025
He was told to wait in the dining room

335
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:30,194
because they wanted him to play the role of the detective

336
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,594
that would act as commentator of this deduction quiz at the end.

337
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,994
Oh...

338
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,394
That's that.

339
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,035
But, I guess it's nice to meet you, for the first time, isn't it?

340
00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:38,594
Huh?

341
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:40,794
It's you, isn't it? The one called Haibara?

342
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,294
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,594
I wanted to talk to you from before.

344
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:49,047
This person...

345
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,049
Don't tell me that...

346
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,794
It can't be.

347
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,194
Who is it?

348
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,594
What?

349
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:02,294
I thought somebody was peeking through the door just now.

350
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,594
I guess not.

351
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:16,194
The food and the wine are exquisite.

352
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,094
Fire burning in the field?

353
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:42,294
You solved the mystery of the missing corpse?

354
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:47,105
The deduction quiz this time has not been announced yet.

355
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,794
But, I got a card like this!

356
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,394
We did too.

357
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:53,111
Let me see.

358
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:56,394
It looks to be the same as the instruction card

359
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:59,117
that is usually given out but...

360
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:03,694
what I was told this time was not this sort of trick.

361
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:06,094
What on earth is going on?

362
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,194
I guess we have no choice but to go to the room

363
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,794
of the person playing the role of the victim,

364
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:11,394
who's in car number 8 and ask him!

365
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:13,394
Before that, I got to go to the restroom!

366
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:15,994
I've got to go too!

367
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:19,694
What's up, Haibara?

368
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:23,141
This train... don't you feel a strange presence?

369
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,143
A murderous-like atmosphere.

370
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:29,694
Well, that's because you've read too many Christie novels.

371
00:19:30,594 --> 00:19:31,994
That presence

372
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:34,594
doesn't feel to be just one or two people.

373
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,594
Mr. Noto, may I help you?

374
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:45,894
Mr. Noto! Mr. Noto?

375
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,894
What is it? I didn't call you!

376
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,394
Huh?

377
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,694
But the bell just rung.

378
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,194
Beats me.

379
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,394
I tell you. You don't come when I call

380
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,694
and yet you come when I don't need you.

381
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:00,494
Oh, I'm so very sorry.

382
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:02,794
Oh, I'm fine.

383
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,694
There seems to have been some trouble next door,

384
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:07,494
but it seems to have been a mistake.

385
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:10,194
All right.

386
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:12,294
Oh, yes.

387
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:19,994
Ms. Idenami.

388
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,394
Hey, do something about it, will you?

389
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:24,294
Do what?

390
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:28,394
The sound... I hear strange noises in my room!

391
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,894
Oh.

392
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,211
I don't hear anything.

393
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,213
I heard it a while ago!

394
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,894
Are you implicating that I'm lying?

395
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:40,494
No, I'd do no such thing.

396
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:45,223
See, it's this sound. You hear it, don't you?

397
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,494
Yes, ma'am. I think it's probably

398
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,694
a cell phone or the like that someone forgot.

399
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:54,094
Hey, don't come in! I'll look for it myself!

400
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:55,894
Oh.

401
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:57,794
What I really want to say is,

402
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:01,594
why you didn't find that cell phone before the train started off!

403
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,194
I'm very sorry.

404
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:07,245
What's up?

405
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,094
Over here! This is our room.

406
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,194
Hey, sir,

407
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:14,494
the trick's already been figured out.

408
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:17,594
Come out and explain it, will you?

409
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:21,894
Don't tell me he fell asleep in our room.

410
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,394
No joke!

411
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:28,194
Sir! Get up and unlock the chain, will you?

412
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:29,594
Hey, sir!

413
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:30,694
What's the matter?

414
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:33,271
He seems to be napping on the sofa.

415
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:38,294
He's bleeding from the temple, as if he's dead.

416
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:41,279
I'll bet it's just another part of the deduction quiz?

417
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,294
Move it, will you?

418
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:48,894
-The smell of... -Gun powder.

419
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:52,060
Let's break the door down!

420
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,394
Ready, get set, go!

421
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:03,794
Wow!

422
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:06,094
Another deduction quiz?

423
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:07,994
No.

424
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,307
He's really dead.

425
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,094
Huh?

426
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:17,794
Moreover, this is...

427
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,319
A locked door murder.

428
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,560
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,790
"Conductor's Testimony"

430
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,210
-Locked room. -Building blocks.

431
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,411
-Hot air balloon. -Eel.

432
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:54,500
-Scrutiny. -Locked room.

433
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm locked in and can't stop the round.
