1
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,646
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,646
Next, we'll be performing a song with a lot of beat.

3
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:25,946
"Everlasting Luv"!

4
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:29,246
Love is eternal. Labyrinths are mysterious.

5
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,746
Saturday nights are for mystery.

6
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:33,546
Solve the locked dressing room trick

7
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:36,146
and disclose the mixing noise in the band.

8
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:37,746
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,546
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:41,446
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,649
"The Hand that Plays in Dissonance"

12
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,549
"Yukiko Watanbe (24), Vocalist"

13
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,149
"Makoto Nishimoto (25), Guitarist"

14
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:45,849
"Shota Aoki (27), Bass Player"

15
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,549
"Risako Tanaka (22), Keyboard Player"

16
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,849
"Yusuke Nakamura (30), Drummist"

17
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,549
"Yuuki Sakamoto (38), Music Producer"

18
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:11,449
Conan, eat to your heart's content. No need to hold back!

19
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:14,649
Don't worry about a thing! It's my treat!

20
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:19,649
I can have anything I like? But all there is here are soy beans, sausage

21
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,249
and finger food you eat with alcoholic drinks.

22
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:24,649
What's wrong? Soy beans and sausages for dinner.

23
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:26,149
Isn't it great?

24
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:27,949
One more glass of beer!

25
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,649
Dad, don't drink too much.

26
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:32,249
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:36,649
I wasted half a day shopping with you since you wanted to buy clothes.

28
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,549
Stop nagging me about drinking beer.

29
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,349
But still...

30
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,149
I don't know any of the songs.

31
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:52,249
We'll play something different now.

32
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,049
It's a song that I'm sure you've all heard.

33
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,949
Play Yoko Okino's "Moon Lady"!

34
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:00,149
Don't tell me you can't play it!

35
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,549
Hey, dad!

36
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,249
I'm going to the washroom.

37
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:07,449
Next, we'd like to play S&G's masterpiece for you.

38
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,349
They can't play Yoko's song.

39
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,649
"8th Floor"

40
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,249
Drawings?

41
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:19,249
We had to draw in class the other day.

42
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:22,449
It wasn't easy trying to draw like a kid.

43
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:29,249
Excuse me. I'm sorry if I'm mistaken.

44
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:34,049
Are you the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri?

45
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,849
I am indeed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

46
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,549
Just as I thought!

47
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:43,449
Since you were saying, "Play Yoko Okino's song",

48
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,449
I thought that it could be you.

49
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,349
I saw you on air together with her.

50
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:50,549
My name is Yusuke Nakamura.

51
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,849
You saw me on television?

52
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,449
Hey, give me two glasses of beer!

53
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,749
No thanks.

54
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,249
I just thought that if you were him in person,

55
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:01,149
I'd like to have your autograph here.

56
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,649
No need to be hesitant.

57
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,049
Hey, Conan. Go and buy more snacks!

58
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,049
Okay.

59
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:10,049
You want my autograph? No problem.

60
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:13,049
"Stem beans and popcorn, Fried potato, Fried chicken, French sausage"

61
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,249
I'm sick of all these food already.

62
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,449
Huh? Where's Ran?

63
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,949
The guy just now seems to have the CD

64
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,549
that Ran's been looking for since some time ago,

65
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,449
so she followed him to the dressing room to borrow it.

66
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,549
I see.

67
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:33,049
"Basement, 1st floor"

68
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:35,949
Is the dressing room still open?

69
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,949
No, the key has been returned.

70
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,149
Here.

71
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,549
"Dressing Room, Non-personnel Are Prohibited"

72
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,149
I'm sorry, but could you wait for a while here?

73
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,249
Sure.

74
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,249
So this is how the musical instruments are stored away.

75
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,849
Huh? What's this?

76
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:05,749
Somebody!

77
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,349
What's the matter?

78
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,849
That...

79
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,149
I flipped that blanket over...

80
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,449
and found Yukiko...

81
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,549
She seems to be dead.

82
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,249
Hurry and get Mr. Mouri!

83
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,449
Okay!

84
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:38,749
A person was found dead?

85
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,349
Mr. Mouri.

86
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,649
Yukiko is...

87
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,649
She has been choked to death.

88
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,649
Ran, call the police!

89
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,849
Okay.

90
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,049
This is...

91
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,149
What is it?

92
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:15,549
So the band members are the victim, Ms. Yukiko Watanabe,

93
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,349
you and three other people?

94
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,949
-Yes, sir. -Inspector.

95
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,449
According to the security guard,

96
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,249
the only people who borrowed the key to this room

97
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:25,749
are the members of the band.

98
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,449
Mr. Nakamura.

99
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,249
Could you contact the other three members

100
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,349
and ask them to come back to the department store?

101
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:34,449
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,649
Excuse me. There are green stains

103
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,049
on both shoulders of Ms. Yukiko.

104
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,449
Yeah.

105
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,149
Inspector, there is something around her shoulders.

106
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,449
Please go and check what it is right away.

107
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:50,449
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,949
What's wrong?

109
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,549
I can't help feeling that it looks different from when I first saw it.

110
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:01,949
What do you mean?

111
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,349
I don't really know.

112
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,749
The performance at the beer garden on the roof ended at 8.30 pm.

113
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:15,049
Ms. Yukiko's dead body was found at around 9.15 pm.

114
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:19,249
Will you each tell me what you were doing at that time?

115
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,449
I'd like to also know when you all last met Ms. Yukiko.

116
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:25,549
After I left the stage, I went to the dressing room

117
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,949
to store the instruments with the department store staff.

118
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,249
About 20 minutes later, I went to Mr. Mouri's table

119
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,849
and talked to him for about 15 minutes.

120
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,349
Then, I went to the dressing room with Ran.

121
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,249
The last time I saw Yukiko

122
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,649
was when she came down from the stage and left.

123
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,449
What about the rest of you?

124
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:44,849
I used the elevator to go down to the dressing room

125
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:46,749
together with Shota and Makoto,

126
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,849
and left for home with Shota about 5 minutes later.

127
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:53,849
According to the security guard's log, it was at 8.40 pm.

128
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:58,149
The last I saw Yukiko was in front of the elevator.

129
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,549
Go on without me.

130
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,649
That's what she said.

131
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,649
Me, too.

132
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:05,749
Same here.

133
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,749
What did you do after you left the department store?

134
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,549
Since Shota said he had something to do,

135
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,649
we parted right outside the department store.

136
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,149
What about you, Mr. Nishimoto?

137
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,649
About 5 minutes after they both left,

138
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,649
I returned the dressing room's key to the security guard and went home.

139
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,449
The log says the key was returned at 8.45 pm.

140
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,549
What about you, Mr. Aoki?

141
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,749
I waited for Yukiko for some time

142
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,749
in the car parked in the parking lot.

143
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,549
Why were you waiting for Yukiko?

144
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:41,049
I thought you were dating with Risako.

145
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:44,749
I wasn't dating Yukiko.

146
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,649
Then, why were you with Yukiko yesterday?

147
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,649
You told me you were busy!

148
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,949
So, you were seeing Yukiko after all!

149
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,549
Cut it out. This isn't the place to talk about it.

150
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,549
Before Mr. Nakamura and Ran came to borrow the dressing room's key,

151
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,849
someone else came at 8.55 pm to borrow the key.

152
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:07,149
Mr. Shota Aoki.

153
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,349
It was you, wasn't it?

154
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,449
Yes.

155
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,549
Shota, don't tell me...

156
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,049
No.

157
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,949
Yukiko didn't show up for a while, so I went to check the dressing room.

158
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:22,749
But she wasn't there.

159
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,549
I waited for a while, but she didn't come.

160
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,349
So I had no choice but to return the key and left for home.

161
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:31,049
It was when the department staff were storing the musical instruments.

162
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,149
The security guard did say that the key was returned in about 5 minutes.

163
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,749
By the way, why were you waiting

164
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:44,049
for the victim, Ms. Yukiko Watanabe?

165
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,649
From what you told us,

166
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,749
it seems that you two weren't dating each other either.

167
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:55,949
Yukiko and I were invited to join another band.

168
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,249
What?

169
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,549
We were asked by TMS Record

170
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,749
if we wanted to make a major debut with that band.

171
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,249
Is... Is that so?

172
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:22,049
What's this mark?

173
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,849
Inspector.

174
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,649
I've checked the footage of the surveillance camera in the elevator.

175
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,049
There isn't any footage showing Ms. Yukiko

176
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,349
going from the roof to the basement.

177
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:32,649
What?

178
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,949
Are you saying that Ms. Yukiko used the stairs

179
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,949
to go from the roof to the basement, then?

180
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,149
That's possible.

181
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,549
What makes you think so?

182
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:47,949
Mr. Sakamoto from TMS Record was at the beer garden tonight.

183
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,849
Mr. Sakamoto walked towards the stairs

184
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:53,549
when we were taking the elevator.

185
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:59,049
Could you please get in contact with that Mr. Sakamoto?

186
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,249
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:10,149
Yes. After the performance ended,

188
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,249
I did see Yukiko at the landing between the roof and 8th floor.

189
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,749
You killed Yukiko!

190
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,849
No! I...

191
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:23,049
told her how I felt about her performance and left right afterwards.

192
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,349
She said she didn't want the other members to see me with her.

193
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,449
Liar!

194
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,649
He's not the one who did it.

195
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,649
Neither he nor Yukiko had the key to the dressing room,

196
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,249
so they couldn't have gotten in.

197
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,149
You're getting so worked up.

198
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,449
Makoto, aren't you the one who killed Yukiko?

199
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,549
-What? -I already know

200
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,549
that Yukiko brushed you off.

201
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,949
I bet Yukiko came back before you returned the key, right?

202
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,049
And that's when you...

203
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,349
According to Shota, when he came back from the dressing room,

204
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:57,949
there was nobody there, right?

205
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:02,549
You were the one who had the key all afternoon, weren't you?

206
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,449
Maybe you made a spare key back then?

207
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,749
Don't be ridiculous!

208
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:09,849
You thought that Yukiko took Shota away from you, right?

209
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,349
Stop, everyone!

210
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:13,249
It's a shame to be fighting among ourselves!

211
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:16,849
If we straighten the story out, it should be like this.

212
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,149
Ms. Yukiko who parted with Mr. Sakamoto

213
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,149
took the stairs and returned to the dressing room on Floor B1.

214
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,749
But since she didn't have the key,

215
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:29,249
the killer had to be the one who unlocked the door to the dressing room.

216
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,749
So it's either Mr. Nishimoto, before he returned the key,

217
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,349
Mr. Aoki who went back there once

218
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:40,049
or Ms. Ritsuko who could've secretly made a spare key.

219
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,749
The killer is among the three of you.

220
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:49,049
The landing of the stairs between the roof and 8th floor...

221
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:53,149
Yukiko was talking to Mr. Sakamoto over here.

222
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,249
After that, Yukiko took the stairs all the way down to B1.

223
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:59,849
Why didn't she use the elevator?

224
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,649
Oh, no.

225
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,749
I came all the way here while being lost in thought.

226
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,449
This drawing... Could it be...

227
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:17,649
Is this it?

228
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,749
Could I be wrong?

229
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,749
Kid, what are you doing here?

230
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,849
It's nothing.

231
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:32,349
Come to think of it, the security guard's room is just nearby.

232
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,149
Yet, why did Ran...

233
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,849
Ran!

234
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:37,149
Conan.

235
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,349
When you saw Ms. Yukiko's body,

236
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,149
why did you come all the way to the roof to get us

237
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,949
instead of calling the security guard room that's close by?

238
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:48,749
Because Mr. Nakamura told me to go and get Mr. Mouri.

239
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,749
Oh, right. Conan.

240
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:54,349
I realized something strange.

241
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:56,549
The big drum.

242
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,049
When I first saw it, the drum was on top of this case.

243
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:03,349
But now it's gone.

244
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,349
I see.

245
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:16,949
Mr. Tome.

246
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,449
About the green stuff that was on Ms. Yukiko's shoulders...

247
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:24,649
That's right. It's amazing you figured it out.

248
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,849
All right. Everything's fallen into place now.

249
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,649
That's the killer.

250
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:37,341
Okay, everyone.

251
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:41,341
I need you all to tell me the details at the station.

252
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,741
No way. Do I have to go too?

253
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:45,741
I didn't kill her!

254
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,841
Mouri!

255
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:52,641
Don't tell me... Is this position...

256
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,841
Yes. It's nearing nightfall,

257
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:58,341
so it's about time we end all this

258
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,341
and solve this case.

259
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:08,441
Inspector, Conan was told by the forensic officer

260
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:12,941
that the green thing on the victim's shoulders was crayon.

261
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:14,341
Crayon?

262
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,041
I wonder where it got onto her.

263
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:21,741
There are no crayons in the dressing room.

264
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,441
Where on earth could it be?

265
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,241
It's the 8th floor.

266
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,441
The 8th floor?

267
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:30,841
Children's drawings are exhibited on the 8th floor.

268
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,641
According to Conan,

269
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:37,941
there seems to be a scrape mark on one of the drawings.

270
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:41,641
I'm sure that Ms. Yukiko was attacked on the 8th floor.

271
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,541
She was probably pushed against the drawing then,

272
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,741
and that's when the crayon scraped off onto her clothes.

273
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,841
-What? -In other words,

274
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,241
she wasn't killed in the dressing room, but on the 8th floor.

275
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:55,641
But the body was found in the dressing room.

276
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,141
Her body was moved there.

277
00:16:58,141 --> 00:16:59,641
Officer Takagi.

278
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:04,241
Was there a rectangular mark near her neck?

279
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,841
Yes, there was.

280
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:14,141
Dad, I brought it with me.

281
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,741
What's that?

282
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,041
The case for the bass drum.

283
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,241
Ran, can you open the lid?

284
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,341
All right.

285
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,341
Inspector.

286
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:27,641
There's a metal piece in there for fixing the handle in place, right?

287
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,341
The mark on her leg that you saw

288
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,841
was left behind by the metal piece pushed against it.

289
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:34,141
What?

290
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:38,141
Ms. Yukiko's body was put inside that bass drum case

291
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,841
and carried to where she was found.

292
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:44,241
Isn't that right, Mr. Nakamura?

293
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:49,841
Why are you asking me?

294
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:52,141
You're the only one to ask.

295
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:55,441
You're the only one who helped put away the musical instruments,

296
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,941
so only you had the chance to put Yukiko's body inside.

297
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:04,641
But when I unlocked the door and went into the dressing room,

298
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,341
Yukiko's body was already inside the room.

299
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:09,541
Ms. Ran saw that too.

300
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,841
After I finished cleaning up the dressing room,

301
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,141
I was with you and Ms. Ran the whole time.

302
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:19,341
How on earth would I have time to carry the body to the dressing room?

303
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,541
Unfortunately, the body that Ran saw

304
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,441
was not Ms. Yukiko's body.

305
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:28,541
What do you mean, Mouri?

306
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,841
Mr. Mouri, I brought what you asked for.

307
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:34,041
-Isn't that a mannequin? -Yes.

308
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,641
It was in the sports clothing store on the 8th floor.

309
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:41,641
As you can see, the left hand has been removed.

310
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,041
The hand that Ran saw

311
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,741
was the left hand of this mannequin.

312
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,941
I see.

313
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:51,141
If it's only the hand of a mannequin, he could carry it in easily.

314
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:55,941
But back then, I wasn't carrying the hand of a mannequin, was I?

315
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,741
Mr. Nakamura.

316
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,741
Will you please sound your guitar?

317
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,941
Officer Takagi, will you please sound the guitar?

318
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:07,141
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,941
Huh? It's out of tune.

320
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:20,741
Mr. Nakamura, you were carrying that guitar

321
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:23,741
when you entered the dressing room, weren't you?

322
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:28,141
The hand of that mannequin was hidden inside your guitar.

323
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:32,641
After you hid Ms. Yukiko's body into the drum case,

324
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:35,141
you removed the left hand of that mannequin,

325
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,141
then put Yukiko's glove onto it,

326
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:41,141
and hid it inside the guitar.

327
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:44,541
You probably used masking tape to stick it on.

328
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,941
When he asked me to sign on the guitar,

329
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,841
he really got me.

330
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:55,341
Then, you made Ran wait in the corridor and went into the dressing room,

331
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,541
and took out the mannequin's hand that you had hidden in your guitar.

332
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,841
You set it up using a cushion and blanket,

333
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,541
making it look like a person was there,

334
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,841
and placed the mannequin's hand there.

335
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:09,241
Then, you made Ran think that Ms. Yukiko was lying on the ground.

336
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:11,841
No way.

337
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,041
Leader...

338
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,341
After you told Ran to go and get me,

339
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:22,041
you carried the drum case containing Ms. Yukiko's body

340
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,641
into the dressing room.

341
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:29,741
Then, you took the body out of the case, put the glove on her left hand,

342
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:32,741
and lay her down under the blanket.

343
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:38,541
After that, you most likely hid the mannequin's hand into your guitar.

344
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,441
But you didn't have time to tune the guitar.

345
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,541
This is the truth.

346
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,641
Leader...

347
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:49,641
Why did you do that?

348
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:54,041
This band is my life.

349
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,441
I thought all of you felt the same.

350
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,141
I'll call you again.

351
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:01,341
Okay.

352
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,041
Leader.

353
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,741
It was rumoured that you and Shota

354
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:10,941
were going to join the new band that's going to be formed.

355
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:12,541
Looks like it's true.

356
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,041
That's right. Is there a problem?

357
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,141
You were ousted by the previous band you were in

358
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,841
because you promoted yourself to a record company, weren't you?

359
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:24,541
You're able to sing now thanks to us. Don't you think so?

360
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,041
-What a joke. -What?

361
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,941
You guys made it this far because I joined you.

362
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:35,341
Without me, a lowly band like yours would've fallen apart long ago.

363
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:38,141
What did you say?

364
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:41,241
You should be thankful for the fact that you served as a stepping stone

365
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,341
for me to make my major debut.

366
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,541
I really believed...

367
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,041
that everyone else felt the same.

368
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,341
I really believed that.

369
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,541
Mr. Nakamura.

370
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,441
Please give us the details at the station.

371
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,541
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,941
Looks like the beer kicked in after he solved the case.

373
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,941
Don't mention it. No problem at all.

374
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,441
"Mouri's Detective Agency"

375
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,141
Okay, we're here. Don't forget to take your things.

376
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:53,141
Ran, where are the things you bought?

377
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:57,041
I forgot about them! The clothes I bought!

378
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,041
I'll head back to Beika Department Store.

379
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,541
-Thank you so much. -Thank you so much.
