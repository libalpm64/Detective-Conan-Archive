1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,980
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,080
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,880
Today's mystery is set in a huge mansion,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
there's so many questions before one gets married.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,080
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,890
"Murder Behind Locked Doors on the Night Before the Wedding (Part 1)"

9
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,290
Look at all those people.

10
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,690
Is there a festival or something going on?

11
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,590
This is normal.

12
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,990
It's always like this here on Saturday.

13
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,890
It's ridiculous, there's just so many people.

14
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,090
This is like the Tenjin Festival in Osaka.

15
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,590
You're right.

16
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,390
It's like the crowd during cherry blossom viewing

17
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,690
at the Mint Bureau in Spring.

18
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,090
Who does he think he is,

19
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,690
calling us out of the blue from Tokyo Station

20
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,090
and telling us to meet them

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,690
because he wants a tour of Tokyo.

22
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,590
What a pain.

23
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,090
Don't complain, I'll bet you weren't doing anything anyway.

24
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,990
Since we had to come to Tokyo,

25
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,490
I thought we should take a good look around.

26
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,690
So, what brings you to Tokyo?

27
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,290
We're going to a wedding,

28
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,390
the son of one of my mom's friends is getting married.

29
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,790
My mom was supposed to attend the wedding

30
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,690
but she dropped an octopus ball pan on her foot

31
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,890
and broke her toe.

32
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,190
That sounds painful.

33
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,290
So, you and Kazuha are going in her place?

34
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,290
That's right.

35
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,890
She just tagged along though.

36
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,590
That's not true.

37
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,290
I really didn't want to come

38
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,190
but Heiji's mom asked me to keep an eye on him,

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,190
that's why I'm here!

40
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,090
What a laugh.

41
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,890
Wasn't it you who was so excited about going shopping in Shibuya?

42
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,790
Well then, shall I take you to the place I usually shop at?

43
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,590
Never mind,

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,690
I already know where I want to go.

45
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,190
I see.

46
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,090
How cute.

47
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,490
How about this? Does it look okay?

48
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,490
I guess so, after all, you're pretty.

49
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,290
If you like it, you'd better buy it quick

50
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,690
or someone else will.

51
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,690
Yes, you're right.

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,490
Boy, what's taking those guys so long?

53
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,790
They're the ones who told us to hurry and do our shopping.

54
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,290
Hey.

55
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,490
Yeah?

56
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,090
What are you mad about?

57
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,090
You're mad aren't you? With me...

58
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,990
You're dressed the same.

59
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,890
-What? -Your shirt.

60
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,390
It's the same blue border print, like Heiji's.

61
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,790
That's just coincidence.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,690
It's not just today.

63
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,890
You both wore the same kind of turtle necks.

64
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,090
I bet you two planned it.

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,490
How disgustingly obvious.

66
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,390
Dressing alike in this day and age.

67
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,790
I can't believe how outdated you are.

68
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,890
What's wrong with you? We're in the middle of the street!

69
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,290
There! Now we're not dressed alike.

70
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,290
You're a real nice girl.

71
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,390
I am?

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,390
This place is crowded too.

73
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,790
Kazuha. Ask God to give you slimmer legs.

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,590
Shut up. You idiot.

75
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,490
Ran, why'd you change out of the shirt Eri gave you?

76
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,390
I perspired so much.

77
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,290
Ran, sorry.

78
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,890
Forget it, it's nothing.

79
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,390
Aren't you Heiji?

80
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,990
Shigematsu?

81
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,590
What a surprise running into you here,

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,890
I thought you'd be at the house by now.

83
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,890
Who is that man?

84
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,290
That man's a butler.

85
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,590
He works for the family my mom's friend married into.

86
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,690
Nice to meet you, I'm Shigematsu.

87
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,690
Never mind me, what are you doing here?

88
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,890
I'm accompanying her.

89
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,590
She wanted to get accustomed to the city before the wedding.

90
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,090
You mean she's the...

91
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,990
Yes. This is Kaede, she's getting carried to Kikuhito tomorrow.

92
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,590
"Kaede Katagiri, Fiancee of Kikuhito Morizono"

93
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,290
Pleased to meet you, I'm Kaede Katagiri.

94
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,790
Hello.

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,690
But if she's getting married to Kikuhito, why isn't he showing her around?

96
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,090
We did ask him to come along but...

97
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,990
It's my fault.

98
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,790
I insisted on going to see the Tokyo Tower.

99
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,690
The young master has had a fear of heights since he was a child.

100
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,690
I see.

101
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,990
And so what did you pray for?

102
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,990
That we be blessed with children.

103
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,390
For children?

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,390
That's not how it looked to me.

105
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,590
A woman about to get married is filled with mixed emotions.

106
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,590
That's right, it's called marriage blues.

107
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,590
-Right? -Right?

108
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,190
This is creepy, all of a sudden they're best friends.

109
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,690
Wow, look at the size of this place.

110
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,490
It hasn't change since I came here when I was a kid.

111
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,990
Are you sure it's alright?

112
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,990
For the rest of us to impose like this.

113
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,490
Don't worry. Why don't you stay for dinner too?

114
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,990
Hey, Sakuraba.

115
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,090
These are our guests show some respect.

116
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,390
"Yuji Sakuraba, Morizono family servant" -Pardon me.

117
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,990
Mr. Morizono's cat got away again.

118
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,590
How cute.

119
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,290
Let me have a look.

120
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,990
Ouch!

121
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,590
Why you... Come back here Rebecca.

122
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,890
Sorry.

123
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,190
So, you must be her.

124
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,290
My little brother's princess.

125
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,490
You may be the daughter of some big company president

126
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,390
but prepare yourself.

127
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,390
Starting today, I will teach you how to act

128
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,890
in accordance with our family traditions.

129
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,490
Yes.

130
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,690
Just kidding.

131
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,590
I'm Kikuhito's older sister Yurie.

132
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,590
Have no fear, I live abroad so I won't be bothering you.

133
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,990
Why Miss Yurie...

134
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,090
I've got to give you a lot of credit though.

135
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,390
I heard you came here quite often

136
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,590
and finally hooked my playboy brother.

137
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,090
No, Miss Yurie.

138
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,890
It was your brother who fell in love with her at first sight.

139
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,590
Oh my, wasn't it you who told me?

140
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,590
Well...

141
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,690
Oh well, you did bring them together though, didn't you?

142
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,690
Lucky you, perhaps father will reward you in some form.

143
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,690
Yes.

144
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,390
So, you're that famous detective.

145
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,090
Pleased to meet you, I'm Kogoro Mouri.

146
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,790
It's an honor to sit at the same table with someone such as yourself.

147
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,690
I'm flattered.

148
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,390
To tell you the truth,

149
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,090
I dreamt of becoming a private detective once a long time ago.

150
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,290
Now tell me,

151
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,890
how does it feel to be considered this century's greatest detective?

152
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,890
Actually, I'm surprised myself

153
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,390
by how smoothly I solved all those cases.

154
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,590
I guess you could say it was as if I were dreaming.

155
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,390
Dreaming. You're right about that, old man.

156
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,290
Ouch.

157
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,890
What do you mean by that?

158
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,090
By the way, Shigematsu,

159
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,090
will you bring me my camera?

160
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,390
I want a photo of Mr. Mouri and me.

161
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,690
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,090
And I'd like to see you later in my room.

163
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,890
Your efforts brought those two together.

164
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,190
I want to show you my appreciation.

165
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,990
You can ask for anything.

166
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,690
I'm honored.

167
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,290
And Sakuraba,

168
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,090
my cat's missing again,

169
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,690
will you go look for her?

170
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,790
Of course.

171
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,090
The cat's so capricious.

172
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,190
She was very attached to my wife though.

173
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,590
That do you mean "was"?

174
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,390
My mother...

175
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,090
"Kikuhito Morizono" -died 4 years ago.

176
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,290
In a tragic traffic accident.

177
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,690
Forgive me, this is my son, Kikuhito.

178
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,890
Did you enjoy your tour of Tokyo, honey?

179
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,990
Yes, very much.

180
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,190
Honey?

181
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,390
Yeah.

182
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,590
We'll stop by your office tomorrow after the wedding.

183
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,390
-Sure. -See you tomorrow. Goodnight.

184
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,190
Alright then, goodnight.

185
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,590
What was that sigh for?

186
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,490
I'm just relieved.

187
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,590
Every time I meet up with that guy, we end up involved in a case.

188
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,290
By that guy, do you mean Ran's dad?

189
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,290
Oh yeah, sure.

190
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,590
Every time I'm with the old guy, it never fails...

191
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,290
What was that?

192
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,690
Someone broke the window on the 3rd floor!

193
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,490
Ran, keep an eye on that window.

194
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,190
Kazuha! Just in case,

195
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,690
you'd better tell Shigematsu to meet us.

196
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,790
Heiji?

197
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,390
That's the room.

198
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,990
Hey, everything alright?

199
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,690
What are you doing in there?

200
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,190
On no! It's locked.

201
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,190
Heiji!

202
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,990
What is it? Where's Shigematsu?

203
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,690
That's what's so strange.

204
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,990
Everyone says they haven't seen him for awhile now.

205
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,390
What will we do?

206
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,390
He's supposed to have all the keys for the house.

207
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,590
We don't have a choice.

208
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,190
We have to break it down.

209
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,490
It's blood.

210
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,690
It continues into the next room.

211
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,690
Hey. What's that?

212
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,290
What in the world?

213
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,580
Who screamed?

214
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,680
What happened?

215
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Is something wrong?

216
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,280
What's going on?

217
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,280
He's been murdered.

218
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm talking about your butler,

219
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Shigematsu.

220
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,780
I don't believe it.

221
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,880
That's ridiculous!

222
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Come on, you're kidding, right?

223
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Kaede.

224
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,080
What're you two doing?

225
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,980
Kaede, snap out of it.

226
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,080
I called the police.

227
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,480
Until they get here, I don't want anyone to move.

228
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,080
It's locked.

229
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,580
This side too.

230
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,180
That's enough you two.

231
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,480
Hey!

232
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,180
I don't want you two to touch anything.

233
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,580
Hey, Ran!

234
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,180
You were keeping an eye on this window weren't you?

235
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,980
You didn't see anyone leave through here did you?

236
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,680
No! I didn't see anyone!

237
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
Which means?

238
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
It can't be...

239
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Hey, didn't I just tell you not to touch anything.

240
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,280
Listen!

241
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,080
Shigematsu had all the keys to this house, didn't he?

242
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Yes.

243
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,280
Wasn't there a spare for this room?

244
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
We all have a spare for our own room

245
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,180
but only Shigematsu had the keys to the rooms like these

246
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,180
because it's not usually in use.

247
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,880
Alright then, I just want to check on something.

248
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,080
Check on what?

249
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,780
The lock on this door we broke down.

250
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:37,080
If the key to this door is really on this bunch of keys...

251
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,580
And what if it is?

252
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,080
Don't you see?

253
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,280
We broke this door because it was locked.

254
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
Wasn't it, old man?

255
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,980
That's right.

256
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,380
On top of that,

257
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,680
both windows in the room we found the body were locked,

258
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,880
and furthermore, no one left through the window in this room.

259
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,580
So, if the only key to this room

260
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,180
was in Shigematsu's possession...

261
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,580
I see what you mean.

262
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,780
That's right.

263
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,480
I think you know the answer.

264
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,380
It's a murder behind locked doors.

265
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,580
But Shigematsu could have locked himself in

266
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,980
and committed suicide.

267
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,780
If he did, the weapon he used

268
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,980
would be somewhere near the body.

269
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,980
It's obvious Shigematsu was stabbed once in the chest.

270
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,780
Someone somehow managed to disappear

271
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,880
from this room along with the weapon,

272
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,380
just like the mist.

273
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,480
Give me a break.

274
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,680
I'm getting married tomorrow.

275
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,380
I don't know who's responsible

276
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,280
but they've sure put a damper on things.

277
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
Kikuhito, how can you say such a thing?

278
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,780
After something like this, we can't be concerned about a wedding.

279
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,980
Come on, sister.

280
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,780
The guy wasn't even a member of our family.

281
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,980
Besides, I don't want to cancel our honeymoon.

282
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,980
Shigematsu served our family well for many years

283
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,880
and I'm sorry for what happened

284
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,780
but the wedding will go on as scheduled tomorrow

285
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,280
in a grand style.

286
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,480
I'm sure he would have wanted it that way too.

287
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,580
Right?

288
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,280
Why you...

289
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Kikuhito, that's enough!

290
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,680
Someone has died, what's the matter with you?

291
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
You should be ashamed of yourself.

292
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,980
Sakuraba lost his parents when he was very young,

293
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,180
Shigematsu was like a father to him, you know that.

294
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,780
Why can't you be more considerate of his feelings?

295
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,680
Besides, Shigematsu was the very person

296
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,180
who told me about Kaede being the right girl for you.

297
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,580
And you know all too well how hard he worked as your assistant

298
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,480
for the company I entrusted to you.

299
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,080
How dare you talk about him in that manner?

300
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,980
And Sakuraba, you're just as bad.

301
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,780
You have no right to attack a member of the family you work for.

302
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,880
Please be careful in the future.

303
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,080
Yes, sir.

304
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,180
Yurie, call Kaede's parents later.

305
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,380
Tell them we're postponing tomorrow's ceremony.

306
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Didn't he just move?

307
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,580
What are you talking about? You're crazy.

308
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,680
Good grief, it was only the cat.

309
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,880
Rebecca? Come here.

310
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,580
Which means this cat must've been in here all along.

311
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,080
But a cat can't talk.

312
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,680
You get along well with that cat.

313
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,080
Yurie's the splitting image of my late wife.

314
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,680
Rebecca won't come close to Kikuhito or me

315
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,580
unless it's feeding time.

316
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,480
Sir, the police are here, what has happened?

317
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
You needn't worry. I'll be right down.

318
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,280
What happened to your leg?

319
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,880
I was in the car with my wife when we were involved in the accident.

320
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,280
I merely injured this leg but unfortunately,

321
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,680
my wife was...

322
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,680
Hr. Morizono, is it true your butler Shigematsu was killed?

323
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,180
Will you be postponing your son's wedding tomorrow?

324
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,480
There are rumors your son's company

325
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
is involved in a bribery scandal,

326
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,080
does that have anything to do with today murder?

327
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,180
Stay back! You can ask questions later, later!

328
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm Megure of the Metropolitan Police Department.

329
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,380
Thank you for calling.

330
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,780
I have most of the details.

331
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,080
Wherever he goes, there's trouble,

332
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,880
this jinx of a person filled me in.

333
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,480
Who're you calling a jinx? You make me sound bad.

334
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,780
The cases call out to me, the famous Kogoro Mouri.

335
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,980
A murder in a locked room?

336
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,480
Let's see. The door and the windows in this room were all locked.

337
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,180
No one escaped through the window in the next room

338
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,980
and on top of that, the murder weapon wasn't found at the scene.

339
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,680
So yes, it was a murder in a locked room.

340
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,980
A locked room.

341
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,280
But how did you know there was a body in this room?

342
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,380
I was outside

343
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,480
but that window suddenly broke.

344
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,080
So I came here and knocked on the door but there was no answer.

345
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,880
I had no choice except to break the door down

346
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,780
and that's when I found the body.

347
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,880
But weren't you too hasty concluding it was murder?

348
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,780
The victim could have stabbed himself in the chest,

349
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,980
pulled out the knife

350
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
and thrown it outside breaking the window it is possible...

351
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,480
No, it isn't.

352
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
We looked up as soon as we heard the window break

353
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,380
but we didn't see any knife.

354
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,480
What are you doing here?

355
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
And look at the floor.

356
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,680
If he threw it out the window,

357
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,480
there should be more blood near the window.

358
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,480
And these bloodstains look like they were made

359
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,780
when the murderer dragged the victim in here.

360
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,380
The window might've cracked accidentally

361
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,380
when the killer and the victim fought

362
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,580
or perhaps he saw me outside

363
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,580
and used this chair to break the window to get my attention.

364
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Either way, when the window broke,

365
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,780
the killer was still inside the room, I'm sure of that.

366
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,180
-Inspector! -Yes?

367
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,380
About an hour before the body was discovered,

368
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,680
most of the servants were in the dining room having dinner

369
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,580
and going over the plans for tomorrow's wedding.

370
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,180
So, it seems the only ones without a clear alibi are these five.

371
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,080
I got it.

372
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,680
I'll want to talk to each one of you separately later on.

373
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,980
We'll do a quick body check

374
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,480
and have you wait in a room.

375
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,280
Alright, I want every man to check the grounds

376
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,980
and the neighborhood!

377
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,780
The weapon should be still be somewhere around here.

378
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,480
We've got to find it!

379
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Hey, Kudo, how many you got?

380
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Four!

381
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,780
I knew it. I've got four suspicions too!

382
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,980
First is the weapon the killer took from the scene.

383
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,980
The killer took so much time to lock everything up.

384
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,680
If the weapon was found at the scene,

385
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,080
it would have looked like a suicide.

386
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,880
Second, the bloodstains from the body being dragged.

387
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,980
What did the killer have to move the body?

388
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,780
Third, the light was only on in the room we found the body.

389
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,080
And the fourth is the most puzzling...

390
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,980
-The cat. -The cat.

391
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,880
Actually, I had five but I can't recall the last puzzle.

392
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,280
Really? You too?

393
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,580
Officer, please.

394
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,480
Let me help you.

395
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,980
It's out of the question.

396
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,280
Please wait in the other room.

397
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,980
But I can't just do nothing.

398
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Hey...

399
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,480
Stop it, you fool.

400
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,680
Don't you realize every time you do something rash,

401
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,380
it causes trouble for our family.

402
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,780
Don't forget your place!

403
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,080
Are you alright?

404
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,680
Who does he think he is anyway?

405
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,780
I'm fine, really...

406
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,380
It's matching.

407
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm not talking about your clothes, their pendants.

408
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,680
Pendants?

409
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,780
That's right.

410
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,180
I saw it through his torn collar,

411
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,580
Sakuraba's wearing the pendant as Kaede.

412
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,680
-I wonder what it means. -You're right.

413
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,080
The design's unique, it couldn't be coincidence.

414
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,480
Hey, Kudo.

415
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,880
I know.

416
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,280
I think we've got another on our hands.

417
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,480
Another password to help solve this murder.
