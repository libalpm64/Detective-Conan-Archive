1
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:07,239
I think I overate a bit from morning.

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:10,739
I guess I'll run home then.

3
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,139
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,539
Good morning, sir!

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,003
Good morning, you're out early.

6
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,039
I'm not anyone suspicious.

7
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:47,139
Did somebody drop it?

8
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:49,139
It looks to be so.

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,239
My!

10
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,139
I won't steal this.

11
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,339
It's exactly 30,000,000 yen!

12
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,043
Nobody's reported anything missing yet?

13
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,239
No.

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,047
But, I'm glad that you're the one who picked it up, Mr. Takagi.

15
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,339
So, you're a police detective.

16
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,539
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

17
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,839
So, you're running that course every morning, Ms. Sasamoto?

18
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,039
Yes, but I sure hope that it's returned

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,639
to the person who dropped it as soon as possible.

20
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:24,839
Yes.

21
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,639
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

22
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,539
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

23
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,071
30,000.000 yen is in the bag that is picked up.

24
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,073
What was the real purpose of the owner?

25
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,839
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:38,077
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:40,439
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:28,187
"Officer Takagi Picks Up 30,000,000 Yen"

29
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:31,997
If I know a person who was carrying a brown bag.

30
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:33,997
Yes, although it's not even certain

31
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,997
that the one who dropped it lives around here either.

32
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:39,197
I'll try asking the neighbors for you too, then.

33
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,597
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,497
You did it, Officer Takagi!

35
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:45,597
I heard you picked up a huge sum of money?

36
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,197
You folks, why do you know about that?

37
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:51,297
After all, we're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

38
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,697
If the person who dropped it doesn't appear,

39
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:56,215
then six months later it's going to become yours, isn't it?

40
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:58,217
You'll be a billionaire!

41
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:01,797
No, it won't turn out that way.

42
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:05,397
Because it's the duty of a police officer to turn in lost and found goods.

43
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:08,597
Shoots, you mean I can't get you to treat me eels over rice?

44
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:10,497
I told you so.

45
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:14,497
We'll help you look for the person who dropped it too, then.

46
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:16,497
We don't have school today so we've got a lot of time too.

47
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:17,497
Okay!

48
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:19,997
You picked it up early this morning, is that right?

49
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:22,241
Yes, about 6:00 am.

50
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,397
Since today is my day off,

51
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,597
I slept over last night at my friend's house near here.

52
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:31,897
Then while I was jogging along with a woman called Ms. Sasamoto,

53
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,253
I found it right about here.

54
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,997
Right in the middle of the road?

55
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:36,997
Yeah.

56
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:43,197
What an idiot, to drop a bag full of cash.

57
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:46,265
Takagi, let's me and you join hands.

58
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:49,497
If we tell them that I, a civilian picked it up...

59
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,997
Hello.

60
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:54,273
Yes. That's right.

61
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,275
The person who dropped the bag appeared?

62
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,997
So, if you're ever in trouble again,

63
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:00,897
just holler.

64
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,797
I wonder what he came for?

65
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,097
"Toshiyuki Hiranuma (45)" -Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma.

66
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,197
He's the one who dropped the bag, correct?

67
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:10,597
Correct.

68
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:14,697
It seems that Mr. Hiranuma's wife recently passed away of an illness,

69
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:18,097
and the 30,000,000 yen was money from the life insurance.

70
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:19,497
I see.

71
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:23,297
But, Mr. Hiranuma, how did you happen to drop that money?

72
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:26,305
Well, it's an embarrassing story but...

73
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:29,097
I have a friend in Beikacho

74
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,897
and I was going to show it to him.

75
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:35,097
You mean you took 30,000,000 yen just to brag about it?

76
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,697
Yes, sort of.

77
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:39,797
So, I drank up and came back in a good mood.

78
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,197
When I got up this morning,

79
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:43,797
I realized that the bag was gone and went pale.

80
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:47,597
Which means that you dropped it not this morning, but last night?

81
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,997
Yes.

82
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,329
I understand.

83
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,797
However, because the cash amount is large,

84
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:55,297
we can't give it back to you right away.

85
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:56,897
I see.

86
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,997
Is that paint?

87
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:03,997
Thank you. I wonder where I got it on?

88
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,297
Okay, then, after preparations to give the bag back to you are made,

89
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:08,997
the station will contact you.

90
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:09,997
Thank you.

91
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:12,797
It's not that I'm in a rush so that's fine.

92
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:18,097
The person who dropped the bag came out quite easily.

93
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:20,997
We, the Detective Squad didn't get a chance to help.

94
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,361
No fun.

95
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:29,197
Officer, I was just about to go to the police box now.

96
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:30,797
Granny that I saw this morning.

97
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:33,697
It wasn't there?

98
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:37,097
Yes. I think it was about 5:00 am.

99
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,379
When I passed there to deliver newspaper,

100
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,897
there was nothing like that there.

101
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,897
Which means that Mr. Hiranuma probably dropped it

102
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,097
after the newspaper delivery man passed there.

103
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:56,897
Creepy.

104
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:59,497
Is there anything there, Conan?

105
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,897
I can't tell yet but...

106
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:07,097
Could this be the traces of Mr. Hiranuma's shoe prints?

107
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:11,297
It's true that Mr. Hirnuma's shoes were dirty.

108
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,697
And besides...

109
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,897
The trace of this paint...

110
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:18,897
is the same one that was on Mr. Hiranuma's shoulder.

111
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:24,423
Ouch.

112
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:28,797
Then, Conan, are you saying that Mr. Hiranuma was here this morning?

113
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:33,497
Yes. And he put the bag here just before you came, Officer Takagi.

114
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:34,433
Put it here?

115
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,435
Because it's hard to believe that no one passed by here

116
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,697
between nearly an hour's time that the newspaper delivery man passed here

117
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:41,997
to when you passed by,

118
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:45,197
no matter how early it was in the morning.

119
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,897
I see.

120
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:49,697
If he dropped it right before I got there,

121
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:52,451
I should've seen Mr. Hiranuma when I picked it up.

122
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:53,797
Right.

123
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,455
In other words, back then, Mr. Hiranuma was...

124
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,457
In order to make someone pick up the bag

125
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,097
he checked the time using his watch,

126
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:02,461
put the bag in the middle of the road,

127
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,397
and was checking things out from this dilapidated building.

128
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,897
Did somebody drop it?

129
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,469
It looks to be so.

130
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:15,997
But, why did he want Officer Takagi to pick it up?

131
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,997
I see! Ms. Sasamoto!

132
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,497
I passed here by coincidence,

133
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:25,397
but Ms. Sasamoto said that she jogs here every morning.

134
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,197
Then, does it mean that he was trying to make

135
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:29,697
Ms. Sasamoto pick up the 30,000,000 yen?

136
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:32,997
But, it still strange, being that it's such a large sum.

137
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:34,297
Right.

138
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,197
"Hideko Sasamoto" -If so, you can return it to the person who dropped it?

139
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:41,497
I'm glad.

140
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:44,497
It's a man called Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma,

141
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:46,997
but don't you know him, Ms. Sasamoto?

142
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:48,507
Mr. Hiranuma?

143
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,997
No, not that I know of...

144
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,511
What about him?

145
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,513
Who is that man?

146
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,097
It seems he's from the police or something.

147
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:58,517
Police?

148
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:03,597
It didn't look as if she was playing dumb.

149
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:06,525
Officer.

150
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,797
Yes. What is it?

151
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:11,097
"Kunitaro Oba (50)" -Did you find the culprit?

152
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,597
Culprit?

153
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:17,397
That's not what you're here for?

154
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:21,397
My name is Oba.

155
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:23,997
I'm the floor chief for this supermarket.

156
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,397
And, what's this about Mrs. Sasamoto's husband's case?

157
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:32,551
Mrs. Sasamoto's husband was killed.

158
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,997
It's been 15 years already after the 30th of last month,

159
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:39,597
and the culprit still hasn't been caught.

160
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:40,559
If it were in the past,

161
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,561
the statute of limitations would've already run out.

162
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,297
Yes.

163
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,565
She's become cheerful now,

164
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,297
but back then she would hardly smile

165
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,697
and was always looking down.

166
00:09:55,097 --> 00:10:01,097
The fact is, I'm getting married with Hideko.

167
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:04,583
She turned me down when I first proposed to her

168
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,897
saying that she felt apologetic to her late husband

169
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,097
if only she alone became happy.

170
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:12,897
But, that's strange, don't you think?

171
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:20,897
Only recently, she has begun to think about her own happiness.

172
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:25,397
The other day, we both went to her husband's grave

173
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:29,597
to ask him to set her free.

174
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:33,897
But it doesn't work out that easily, does it?

175
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,797
If that culprit were to appear...

176
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:40,297
To think that we have to continue hating him again...

177
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:43,297
Chief!

178
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:45,397
Sorry, I'll be right there.

179
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,897
15 years and still unsolved?

180
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:55,797
That case and the 30,000,000 yen...

181
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,197
I wonder if there's no connection.

182
00:10:58,197 --> 00:10:59,897
That's too outrageous.

183
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,797
How would they be connected?

184
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:04,097
I still don't know yet but...

185
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,397
I get it.

186
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:09,297
I'll try checking on that case then.

187
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:12,651
The case occurred on a certain night 15 years ago

188
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:16,197
on the 4th floor of an office in a multi-functional building.

189
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,657
He was probably afraid of the surveillance camera

190
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,397
because the culprit climbed up to the 4th floor

191
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,997
using a pipe connecting one building to the other.

192
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,197
And broke into the office from the veranda.

193
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:28,667
Then, killed Mr. Akio Sasamoto who was working over time alone

194
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,997
and stole 5,000,000 yen in cash.

195
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,673
But, since the shoe prints of the shoes

196
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,697
that the culprit was wearing was left behind,

197
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,397
the purchaser's list of the sneaker was made

198
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:43,097
and a thorough investigation was carried out.

199
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:47,797
Mr. Hiranuma's name was also on the purchaser's list.

200
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:50,689
I see, so that's the story.

201
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,097
What do you mean?

202
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:54,697
For compensation of that case,

203
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:59,297
he tried to give the 30,000,000 yen to Mrs. Sasamoto, his bereaved wife.

204
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,699
He wanted her to pick it up.

205
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,397
He figured that if he didn't appear as the one who dropped it,

206
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:06,197
it would become hers in 6 months.

207
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:10,709
Then, are you saying that Mr. Hiranuma is the culprit of that case?

208
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,197
No.

209
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,397
I thought the same thing at first,

210
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:19,897
but, Conan, Mr. Hiranuma wasn't the culprit.

211
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,012
It was impossible for Mr. Hiranuma to commit the crime.

212
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:31,212
What do you mean?

213
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:33,312
When the investigators visited him,

214
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:36,735
Mr. Hiranuma had a broken leg.

215
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,212
They confirmed at the hospital that he commuted to

216
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:42,312
and found that his broken leg was put into a cast

217
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,743
three days before the incident occurred.

218
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:49,812
He couldn't have climbed up to the 4th floor with a broken leg.

219
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:50,749
With a cast on,

220
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,751
he wouldn't have been able to wear sneakers either.

221
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,312
Yeah. The case that occurred 15 years ago

222
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:59,112
and Mr. Hiranuma's 30,000,000 yen isn't connected after all.

223
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,312
Thinking that Mr. Hiranuma wanted her to pick it up,

224
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:05,412
was just an incorrect assumption, I guess.

225
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,767
Telephone. It's from pops.

226
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,912
Hello. Pops, what is it?

227
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:18,312
It seems that Pops Kogoro was also concerned about that 30,000,000 yen.

228
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:20,212
When I told him about what I heard just now,

229
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:23,712
he said for me to tell you Officer Takagi to check on something.

230
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:26,785
He said he wanted you to check to see

231
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,512
if there was someone else who also had a broken leg back then.

232
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,793
If Mr. Mouri says so I'll try and check but...

233
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:37,912
He asked if the Youth Detective Squad would help out too.

234
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:40,212
He wants information on Mr. Hiranuma,

235
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:42,801
no matter what it may be.

236
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,612
We're going to help the famed detective?

237
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,012
-Aye! Let's start investigation! -Aye!

238
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,412
See you later, then.

239
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:53,912
"Store Closure Notice"

240
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:54,813
"Organic Food Store, Hiranuma"

241
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:58,512
It seems like this store closed about a month ago.

242
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,812
It seems that his wife who was sick all the while,

243
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:02,112
passed away at around the same time too.

244
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,212
It seems Mr. Hiranuma is a very serious and nice man.

245
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,612
Only, there's one strange thing about him lately.

246
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:11,712
It seems he said that he was going to go on a trip for a while,

247
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:15,212
and yet, it seems he came back that very same day.

248
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,812
It seems to have been about a week ago.

249
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,112
A week ago?

250
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:20,112
"Cleaner, Speed Cleaning"

251
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:21,912
Oh, that.

252
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:25,312
At the end of last month, on the 30th if I remember correctly.

253
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:27,812
But, come to think of it now,

254
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:31,312
Mr. Hiranuma was saying some weird meaningful things

255
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:33,512
from the night before.

256
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:36,212
You really did a good job taking care of her.

257
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:39,412
But, take it easy from now on.

258
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,512
I'm sure your late wife is thinking likewise too.

259
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:44,863
I would like to if I could I've been planning to do so

260
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,865
since some time ago and yet,

261
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:49,612
when the time comes I get scared.

262
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,012
What're talking about?

263
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:56,012
I... I'm such a wretch.

264
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,712
All he did after that was keep saying,

265
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:03,712
"It's not something I can undo with money"

266
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:07,312
And the following morning after that...

267
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:14,112
Mr. Hiranuma, carrying a bag are you going to a hot spring or something?

268
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:16,895
No, I think I'll go somewhere far away for a while.

269
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:20,012
Then, you take care too, Mr. Morita.

270
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:26,905
It sounded like he was bidding farewell to this world or something.

271
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:30,212
In spite of that, at sundown the same day,

272
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:33,412
he came back saying that he couldn't go on the trip.

273
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,212
What does that mean, Conan?

274
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,919
Officer Takagi.

275
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:42,212
Hello.

276
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,912
Kanzaki, drinking beer from daytime?

277
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,612
It's my day off today.

278
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,712
-Hello. -Yes, welcome.

279
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:52,512
-Plain soba, please. -One plain soba!

280
00:15:58,612 --> 00:15:59,912
And?

281
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:04,412
Well, I missteped on the stairs and broke my right leg.

282
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:06,312
Back then, Mr. Kanzaki,

283
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:10,112
I assume you didn't have your health insurance card with you?

284
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:13,412
Who are you? Who told you that?

285
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:18,957
That day Mr. Hiranuma found out...

286
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,612
That's why he did what he did.

287
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:30,112
And? What does the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri want with us?

288
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,612
I have no idea, either...

289
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,973
Let me introduce you.

290
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,975
This is Mrs. Hideko Sasamoto.

291
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,312
She's the one who picked the bag in question up with me.

292
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,912
Hey, Takagi!

293
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:43,912
What's with calling me out suddenly like this.

294
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,512
I'm busy too.

295
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:48,412
What? But, Mr. Mouri, you're the one who...

296
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:52,712
What did I do...

297
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,012
It's come!

298
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,995
He fell asleep.

299
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,997
For a Detective as good as I am,

300
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,012
I can see through things just by information

301
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:05,012
that I have heard from others, Mr. Hiranuma.

302
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,005
Just what're you talking about?

303
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,812
Of course, what else but the murder robbery

304
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,812
that you committed 15 years ago.

305
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,412
-Don't tell me that... -It's exactly that.

306
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:20,012
But, it was impossible for him to do it, Mr. Mouri.

307
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:21,712
Three days before the incident occurred,

308
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:24,412
Mr. Hiranuma had broken his leg.

309
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:25,912
Just because the medical records

310
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,712
and the X-Ray were in Mr. Hiranuma's name,

311
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:33,031
that's no guarantee that they were really his.

312
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,312
Are you saying that Mr. Kanzaki borrowed the health insurance card?

313
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,112
Then, what about the cast?

314
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:42,112
He probably put it together by himself after committing the crime.

315
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:44,312
-But... -There's no proof!

316
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:45,812
But, Takagi...

317
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:48,312
If Mr. Hiranuma is innocent,

318
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,712
why hasn't he even once retorted since a while ago?

319
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,812
I thought it up when Kanzaki broke his leg.

320
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,512
It really hurts.

321
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:03,512
I'm sure it's broken.

322
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,312
Really, the least you can do is pay your health insurance bill, stupid!

323
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:07,412
I'll lend you mine.

324
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,512
I'm not going to get caught, am I?

325
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:11,412
No way. There's no photo on it either.

326
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,812
Right, it's me.

327
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:18,612
I did it.

328
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,812
I'm so very sorry.

329
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:27,612
Back then, I was unreliable, a coward,

330
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,712
and a hopeless punk.

331
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,812
But,

332
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,312
after meeting a certain woman,

333
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,312
I was reborn.

334
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,312
I married that woman,

335
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:41,099
and worked with all my might.

336
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:46,412
And, although small, I was able to open a shop of my own.

337
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:50,412
But the more, we became happier,

338
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:53,412
the more I started to regret the wrongs I did in the past.

339
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:59,412
I thought of turning myself in many times

340
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:01,912
but, I couldn't.

341
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:05,812
My wife fell ill.

342
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,512
Since my wife was totally alone with no family,

343
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:08,812
without me caring for her,

344
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:12,012
she would have no one to look after her.

345
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:16,412
She passed away a month ago.

346
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:19,912
What I got after that was that 30,000,000 yen.

347
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:23,141
Then, you didn't drop that money after all,

348
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:26,012
but intentionally put it there.

349
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,145
Yes.

350
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,912
But, why'd you do something so roundabout?

351
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,612
Right! If you felt apologetic,

352
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,412
all you had to do was give it to her directly.

353
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,912
I was a coward.

354
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:41,159
I was scared of being arrested by the police.

355
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,161
Wrong, Mr. Hiranuma.

356
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:49,167
You came here a week ago, didn't you?

357
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,512
And, you were going to give the 30,000,000 yen to Mrs. Sasamoto,

358
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:55,512
then turn yourself in right after.

359
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,312
But, you couldn't do so.

360
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:05,183
Back then I heard, when I was here.

361
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:11,212
Mr. Sasamoto, I proposed to Hideko.

362
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:14,012
But, she said...

363
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,812
She feels bad if she alone becomes happy.

364
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:18,712
She says she feels guilty.

365
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:20,612
I understand how you feel.

366
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:24,712
But, today already makes 15 years.

367
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:30,612
Please won't you set her free from being the bereaved wife of a victim.

368
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,812
It's not that I can forget you but,

369
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:37,812
I'll put the case behind way deep in the drawer of my heart

370
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:40,812
and try to forget it.

371
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:42,312
Please forgive me.

372
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:45,012
Let's go.

373
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,412
Yes.

374
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,227
I couldn't come up front.

375
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:53,612
Because the bereaved is trying to forget the incident.

376
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,312
You ended up not being able to give her the money for compensation,

377
00:20:56,312 --> 00:21:01,612
apologize to her, or even to turn yourself in.

378
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:05,012
If a culprit's that's been on the run for 15 years turns himself in,

379
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:08,712
the media would most naturally avalanche over to the bereaved family

380
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:12,712
when she's trying to make a new start.

381
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,255
But, Mr. Hiranuma...

382
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,312
No matter how you may convince yourself,

383
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,261
you can never erase your past.

384
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:30,712
But, this case is special.

385
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:33,271
Although we cannot erase the fact that it happened,

386
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:36,212
we could bring it to a close.

387
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,277
By you serving your sentence, Mr. Hiranuma

388
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:42,812
and by Mrs. Sasamoto accepting that.

389
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:44,512
And, once you've settled things,

390
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,712
there's no need for you to carry the burden of it anymore.

391
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:50,712
Both of you can start off anew.

392
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:52,412
Right, Takagi?

393
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,293
Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma,

394
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:57,295
please come to the station,

395
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,297
you are charged with homicide robbery.

396
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,112
Yes.

397
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:08,812
That 30,000,000 yen... won't you please accept it?

398
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:12,812
Please use it when you make a new start.

399
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:41,399
-Bye. -See you tomorrow!

400
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,912
Bye, bye!

401
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:49,407
I forgot!

402
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:55,412
Where is this?

403
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:59,012
Sorry, pops.

404
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,420
"Fox".

406
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,420
Mr. Mouri, were you also found lying on the ground?

407
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,216
I'm entitled to 10 percent of the 30,000,000 yen too!

408
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,080
I don't think you should pick him up.
