1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,390
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,590
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,390
The "Hope" in the case comes with Tokyo approaching.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,190
What is to be with the two police officers?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,790
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,690
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,900
On board the Shinkansen from Osaka,

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,400
we run into Officers Sato and Takagi escorting a suspect.

10
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,300
However, a bomb scare happens inside the train.

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Officer Sato heads for the location.

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Meanwhile, the suspect the officers are escorting

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,900
decides he wants to go to a restroom.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,600
Reluctantly, Officer Takagi takes him to the john without his backup.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
There, the suspect tries to commit suicide.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,700
However...

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,600
"Escort on the Shinkansen (Part 2)"

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes.

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
This is undisputedly a murder case.

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,500
Murder?

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,900
Yes.

22
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,600
First, the culprit set up a bomb scare in the train car at the back.

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,100
I was forced to go there.

24
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,200
In no way that Officer Takagi will not suspect,

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100
the culprit sent a message to Ogura,

26
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,800
telling him to go to the restroom in the train car ahead of him.

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,400
Ogura was made to pretend to commit suicide

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
with the knife and fake blood hid in inside the toilet.

29
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,600
That way, Officer Takagi will remove his handcuffs to call me.

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,300
When Officer Takagi left, the culprit who was hiding...

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,100
immediately went to the toilet.

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,900
And killed Ogura.

33
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,100
But the knife was stabbed deep.

34
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
I looked inside the john to check before Ogura entered,

35
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,500
I didn't see any knife or fake blood.

36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,400
Probably the knife didn't have any blade from the handle,

37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,100
it must have been a fake knife.

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
The hiding place was probably...

39
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,700
the rack behind this diaper-changing table.

40
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,900
There must have been fake blood and knife here with a memo.

41
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,600
With the table raised, it can't be found.

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,500
What memo?

43
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
A memo describing a fake plan to dupe Ogura.

44
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
The memo must have said, "I planted a bomb".

46
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,700
Use the fake blood and knife and pretend to commit suicide.

47
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,500
When the cop is gone,

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,800
I will cut the handcuffs lose

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,200
and let you escape when the bomb explodes".

50
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,900
But, why did you call Sato on the cell phone?

51
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,800
Well...

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Right at that moment, we were in a tunnel,

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,100
and the cell phone didn't...

54
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
Yes.

55
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,600
There must have been a watch with the memo,

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
and the memo must have said,

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,500
"Take action when the train enters Shintanna Tunnel."

58
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,650
We've been framed.

59
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,950
But, with all this blood,

60
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,950
the culprit must have a lot of blood on him as well.

61
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,250
You're right.

62
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,950
People will notice if you go back with blood all over you.

63
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,950
Did you find somebody like that on the train on your side, Ran?

64
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,650
Yes.

65
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,050
After Officer Takagi took the suspect to the restroom,

66
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,750
I was watching the door.

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,350
But, only Officer Takagi returned.

68
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,750
The culprit left Car #3

69
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,550
and headed toward Car #1, toward the head of the train.

70
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,950
That'll make him hard to find.

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,050
What's this?

72
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,250
Something inside his bloody hand.

73
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,850
Something attaches.

74
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,350
So, that's it. The culprit used this for...

75
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,950
-I told you to watch him. -All right.

76
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,950
But, how could the culprit send the message "Go to the toilet" to Ogura,

77
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,950
without Officer Takagi noticing?

78
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,250
Hey, Takagi.

79
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,950
Yes.

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,150
After I went to the back car of the Shinkansen,

81
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,850
did you see anybody suspicious?

82
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,250
No one in particular.

83
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,750
After you left, I think two or three passengers passed by our seats.

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,050
Who were they? Do you remember their faces?

85
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,550
Well, it was just for a very short time.

86
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,150
I remember!

87
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,150
Only three passed by the aisle.

88
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,550
Two men were holding newspapers

89
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,950
and another man carried a can of coffee.

90
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,750
Do you think you can identify those three?

91
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,950
Yes.

92
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,850
What?

93
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,750
Inside the restroom...

94
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,750
A man was killed?

95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,850
Then, why do we have to be interrogated by police?

96
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,650
Well, because just before the man left for the restroom,

97
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,850
you three passed by the seats.

98
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,350
We suspect that one of you had signaled this man to go to the restroom.

99
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,050
If you don't mind,

100
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,150
we would like to know why you had passed by his seat at that time.

101
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,750
"Tatsuro Iwakuni (47)" -My seat was four rows behind you.

102
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,050
When I heard the noise In the car behind me getting louder,

103
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,650
I moved to the car ahead of me

104
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,250
because I wanted to listen to the radio.

105
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,550
I see.

106
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,750
How about you?

107
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,750
Well...

108
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
"Norio Tokuyama (51)" -I bought a can of coffee from a vending machine

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,950
and was returning to my seat.

110
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,750
At that time, I heard that there was a bomb in one of the restrooms.

111
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,150
I never thought that somebody got killed.

112
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,750
The next person.

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,050
"Akira Akashi (29)" -I got scared about the bomb

114
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,250
and moved to the train car ahead.

115
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,750
I have been told that Mr. Akashi and Mr. Iwakuni

116
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,350
were both holding newspapers in your hands when you passed by.

117
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,650
Yes.

118
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,550
Yes, I did, too.

119
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,650
Talking about newspapers, this guy was reading one, too.

120
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,350
-Right? -Well, yes.

121
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,150
Then, could all three of you bring the newspapers?

122
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,450
Also, don't forget to bring the can of coffee, Mr. Tokuyama.

123
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,250
So, all three of them boarded the train at Shin Osaka Station.

124
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,450
And before boarding, you bought newspapers at the kiosk on the platform.

125
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,150
Mr. Iwakuni had Keiba 7.

126
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,150
Tokuyama had the morning edition of Maicho Shimbun and a can of coffee.

127
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,450
Mr. Akashi got Nichiuri Sports.

128
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,850
None of these newspapers have the words "toilet" or "restroom"

129
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,550
written in large letters.

130
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,650
None of them have holes or traces of blood.

131
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,550
The same is true for the can.

132
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,650
There is no way a message to go to the toilet can be sent.

133
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,050
What? Wait.

134
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,150
This must be...

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,550
What? A man stabbed himself while sitting on the toilet?

136
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,850
Isn't that supposed to be suicide?

137
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,550
Well, that was a hoax to try to deceive us.

138
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,150
When we returned, the knife had been removed.

139
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,450
The blade of the knife was pointed the strange way.

140
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,650
Then...

141
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,350
Because it was hard to remove the knife,

142
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,050
he may have tried to stand up and pull it out with both hands?

143
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,550
He is right!

144
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,350
If he had pulled out the knife standing up,

145
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,650
you'll never know which way the knife will turn.

146
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,350
You mean to tell me that you suspect us just because of that?

147
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,950
Well...

148
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Anyway, I refuse to remain after the train arrives in Tokyo.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Me, too.

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Same here.

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,100
Pops.

152
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,200
What is it?

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,900
Do you remember what newspaper you bought

154
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,200
at the platform kiosk in Shin Osaka Station?

155
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, let's see...

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's "Keiba 7",

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,100
"Nichiuri Sports" and canned coffee.

158
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,200
And I think, two packs of cigarettes.

159
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
What's that has to do with this?

160
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,100
Well, nothing.

161
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,600
My hunch is right.

162
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,200
The culprit said something strange.

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
That person...

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,300
How he made Ogura come to the restroom...

165
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,100
How he killed him...

166
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,800
I got it all.

167
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Even something that you missed.

168
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,710
Suicide, of course! It was suicide, all right?

169
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,060
If it is not murder, we have nothing to do with it.

170
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,960
Well...

171
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,760
There's nothing more to talk about.

172
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,460
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for boarding the Nozomi.

173
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,060
We are now arriving at the terminal Tokyo Station.

174
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,960
It's time to leave, bye.

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm leaving too, I need to pack my things.

176
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,360
Wait...

177
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
We're in trouble,

178
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,160
getting our man killed on the train,

179
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,960
and if we let the killer go,

180
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,260
we're seriously in trouble.

181
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,160
Especially you, Takagi, having been by his side.

182
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,360
You're really gonna get it.

183
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,260
No way.

184
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,460
Well, not to worry!

185
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,660
If you get fired, you can become

186
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,960
my assistant at the detective office.

187
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,760
Mr. Mouri?

188
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,560
Well, just a fleeting thought,

189
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,960
I can't make you my assistant just yet.

190
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,960
Whether or not I will hire you as an assistant,

191
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,660
depends on whether you go through with your job as a police officer.

192
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,160
I need you to see the man behind you.

193
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,960
You fulfill your duty and arrest the man as the murderer.

194
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,360
-What do you mean that man? -You found the murderer?

195
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,660
The problem was

196
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,960
how the culprit communicated the message to go to the toilet

197
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,260
without Officer Takagi noticing.

198
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,660
This is where attention is directed to.

199
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,560
When the three suspects passed by Ogura,

200
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360
carrying newspapers and a can of coffee.

201
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Do you get it, Officer Takagi?

202
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,260
There you see the characters suggesting the toilet.

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,360
But where?

204
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Where can I find such characters?

205
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,060
There, can't you see that?

206
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,860
Title characters suggesting toilet...

207
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,260
The letters WC, meaning "water closet"...

208
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,860
in there.

209
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,260
Takagi!

210
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,060
You mean to tell me...

211
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,560
The World Cup?

212
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,660
Yes.

213
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,360
He carried the newspaper to make the headline clear to see.

214
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,860
When he passed by Ogura's seat,

215
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,260
he pointed to the letters WC to tell him to go to the toilet.

216
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,560
Isn't that right?

217
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,960
It was the man carrying this sports newspaper,

218
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Mr. Akira Akashi?

219
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,860
What?

220
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,560
You must be kidding...

221
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Don't try to make me the culprit just for carrying a sports newspaper.

222
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
You're right.

223
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,460
Associating the toilet with the letters WC

224
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,360
appears to be a bit unconvincing in logic.

225
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
That is why Mr. Akashi placed the bag

226
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,460
in the toilet cubicle in the bomb scare.

227
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,160
He made the train personnel

228
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,860
report this to the police officer right in front of him

229
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,660
in order to emphasize the word "toilet" to Ogura.

230
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,660
If he points to the letters W

231
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,360
and then points to the car ahead of him,

232
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,260
Without saying a single word,

233
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,660
Ogura will most certainly go to the toilet in the car ahead of him.

234
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,760
Probably...

235
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Mr. Akashi was watching Officer Takagi

236
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,560
buy the tickets at the station on that day.

237
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Boarded the same Shinkansen train

238
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,060
and executed his plot to kill...

239
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Stop playing with me...

240
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
Oh! I'm sorry!

241
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,260
I thought you were asleep.

242
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I have heard of you before,

243
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,560
but it was my first time seeing "Sleeping Kogoro" in action.

244
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Sleeping Kogoro?

245
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,660
You mean the famous detective?

246
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,860
I don't care what kind of sleeper he is,

247
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,360
but there is no proof that I'm the killer

248
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,760
and you accuse me of the murder.

249
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
It is murder.

250
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,960
The knife we found inside the toilet was very unnatural.

251
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,160
Did you hear what I said before?

252
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
He tried to pull out the knife but couldn't.

253
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
So, he stood up and pulled it out with both hands.

254
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Well...

255
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,860
Why do you have to stand up to pull out the knife with both hands?

256
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,260
Are you fool?

257
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,660
You need to stand up to reach for the knife with your left...

258
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,160
That's right.

259
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,660
Certainly, Ogura was chained to the hand bar at that time

260
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,260
and could not have used both hands unless he stood up.

261
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,460
What is strange is that

262
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:50,060
you have never seen the site of the murder. Why do you know?

263
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,960
Just my imagination.

264
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,860
When the man stabbed himself,

265
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,060
I heard that the police officer went to call the other officer.

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,960
So, I imagined that the handcuffs were chained to the hand bar.

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,660
Well, how did you know that the man had been in handcuffs?

268
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,260
When I pass by the seat of this police officer

269
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,960
that man was sitting beside him with both hands covered with cloth!

270
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,560
Then, how did you know that the victim was the same man?

271
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,260
Well, just from the course of developments...

272
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,160
Anyway, if you have so much to complain about me,

273
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,160
show me the proof!

274
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,760
Did you find my fingerprints on the weapon?

275
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,160
Do you see blood on my body?

276
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,860
Of course, there's no blood on you.

277
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,060
You have the victim hold the newspaper.

278
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,660
And then, you stabbed him through the newspaper...

279
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,060
The proof is seen in the bloody right hand of the victim.

280
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,560
A newspaper article was printed on the palm of his right hand,

281
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,660
since he was grabbing onto the newspaper.

282
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,060
I see.

283
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,860
That way, the killer won't get blood on his clothes.

284
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,760
What are you saying?

285
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,760
There is no hole or blood on my newspaper!

286
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,060
That's why you bought two copies.

287
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,760
What?

288
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,960
The same Nichiuri Sports that I bought at the station.

289
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,260
Right, Conan?

290
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,910
See? This is the same newspaper you have!

291
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,260
What proof is there that I bought two copies?

292
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,060
Look. This newspaper looks strange.

293
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,460
Look, the newspaper that Pops bought and a newspaper that you bought.

294
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,360
They looks similar, but the words are different.

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
You're right.

296
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,060
The headline on Father's copy says, "World Cup Hero Arrested",

297
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,160
but here, it says "World Cup Hero Interrogated".

298
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,760
That's the difference between newspapers sold at stations

299
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,860
and those sold elsewhere.

300
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,060
Unlike newspapers sold at convenience stores or delivered to homes,

301
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,460
Newspapers sold at railway stations are delivered late.

302
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,960
That's why, they can switch headlines at the last minute.

303
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
Because this is big news,

304
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,760
the headlines for newspapers sold at stations had been replaced.

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,160
Then, the newspaper that Mr. Akashi had...

306
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,760
He must have bought it at a convenience store.

307
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,360
It must have been very convenient to get Ogura to go to the toilet.

308
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,160
He probably bought another copy of the newspaper

309
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,660
while he waited for him to arrive at the station

310
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,860
to use to keep blood for soiling his clothes.

311
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,860
He bought the same sports newspaper,

312
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,960
just in case people suspect him

313
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,460
for not having the newspaper after the murder.

314
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,660
No! I just bought the same newspaper

315
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,060
because I found the difference in headlines interesting.

316
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,460
Then show me

317
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,260
the Nichirui Sports copy that you bought at the station.

318
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,360
It's...

319
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,660
I bet it's been flushed away in one of the toilets on the train.

320
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,060
We'll find out when we check the septic tanks.

321
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,560
Thank you for boarding the Shinkansen...

322
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,160
Darn it!

323
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,760
I'm not gonna...

324
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,060
let you get away.

325
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,760
You...

326
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,160
Now! You can't get away!

327
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,960
That was fantastic, Officer Takagi!

328
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
Fastball was the solution.

329
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
Oh, nothing...

330
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,460
Immediately after that,

331
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,760
Inspector Megure who had been waiting in Tokyo Station

332
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,860
arrested the killer

333
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,060
and he was taken away to the Police Agency.

334
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,060
The motive of the murder was to seal the lips of the victim

335
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,860
regarding that drug trade route.

336
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Ironically, the killer confessed,

337
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,760
and the route was uncovered and destroyed successfully by the police.

338
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,060
Thanks to this contribution,

339
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,560
Officers Sato and Takagi managed not to get fired.

340
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,160
And Officer Takagi escaped the fate of becoming Pops' assistant.

341
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
And...

342
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
A pay cut! We got a pay cut!

343
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,560
On top of the measly pay we are getting in the first place.

344
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,060
Isn't that horrible?

345
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,260
Take it easy.

346
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,860
Actually, a pay cut affects promotion, doesn't it?

347
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,360
True.

348
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,060
Don't take it too hard.

349
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,660
You're a girl and you can always find a way out through marriage.

350
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,960
I'm not interested in marriage.

351
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,260
I want to work for the peace and security of the people of Tokyo.

352
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,060
Actually the problem is Takagi.

353
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,960
He's never gonna make it beyond the post

354
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,660
of deputy inspector until retirement.

355
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,710
By the way, Yumi.

356
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,910
Do you like Takagi?

357
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,210
What?

358
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,810
What?

359
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,810
What's that surprise on your face?

360
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,810
As a veteran officer in the same section,

361
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,810
I must know about my colleagues.

362
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,610
Yes...

363
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,910
So, what do you feel about him?

364
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,510
Do you like him or not?

365
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,110
Are you in love?

366
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,610
Not really...

367
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,110
I knew it.

368
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:55,910
He looked excited receiving a ticket from you. Poor boy.

369
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,810
You shouldn't be teasing a boy like him.

370
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,110
You should find the right person.

371
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,610
Well, okay.

372
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,010
Miwako has fallen.

373
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:10,310
She's fallen for Operation Ticket Chase.

374
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:16,110
I'd better call the other half of the pay cut pair about the good news.

375
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,110
You should find the right person.

376
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,310
Why should I be doing this? This waste of time.

377
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,610
Thank you very much for taking your time for coming here.

378
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,810
-No problem. -Don't take it too hard.

379
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,210
You can make it up with another successful arrest!

380
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,910
Officer Takagi, what's with you? Straighten up!

381
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,310
Straighten up?

382
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,010
We're going after the case on 4th Street!

383
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,910
Yes!

384
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,210
Officer Sato is as energetic as ever.

385
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,310
She also got a pay cut.

386
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,210
Something nice must have happened to her.

387
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,940
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,660
"Red, White, Blue"

389
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,400
Next time...

390
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,800
Another story about me....
 - Wrong, it's about me!
