1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,840
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,640
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,440
Today, we must all change our way of thinking.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,940
What should be on, isn't?

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,340
His name is Detective Conan.

9
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,390
"A Mysterious Gunshot Echo In The Darkness"

10
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,490
So many handsome actors star in those Monday night mystery shows.

11
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,890
I'm so excited, I wonder what kind of stories we'll get to hear.

12
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,090
Good grief.

13
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,990
Just because our client's the president of some company produces movies,

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,990
this kid insisted on tagging along.

15
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,690
I think I already told you

16
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,890
but my job is to protect the client's mother!

17
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,090
I know that.

18
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,490
But she was injured when she was attacked 3 days ago, wasn't she?

19
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,290
Is being the president of a finance company such a dangerous job?

20
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,590
Well, I've heard she can be pretty vicious.

21
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,290
So that means she's got a lot of enemies, right?

22
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,490
I guess you could say that.

23
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,890
Yes?

24
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,390
My name is Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private investigator.

25
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,990
I have a 7'o clock appointment to see Ms. Etsuko Furukawa.

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,690
Yes, you're expected.

27
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,690
I'll unlock the gate now. Please come in.

28
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,590
This way.

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,790
Conan, we're going.

30
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,590
Okay!

31
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,490
Please have some coffee...

32
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:22,590
I'm terribly sorry about this, Ms. Furukawa is usually punctual.

33
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,190
No, don't be bothered.

34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,290
-Excuse me. -Yes?

35
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,690
If it's alright with you, while we're waiting,

36
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,190
could we watch the television?

37
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,190
I'm sorry. That TV's been on the brink since this morning.

38
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,990
Nothing shows on the screen.

39
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,890
I see.

40
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,390
Idiot, you have some nerve asking like that.

41
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,590
Well...

42
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,990
Excuse me, Miss.

43
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,890
But the window on the far left on the 2nd floor facing the street was open.

44
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,290
That room belongs to the owner of this place,

45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,590
Mrs. Katsue Furukawa, president of the Furukawa Finance.

46
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,090
Pardon me for asking, but who are you?

47
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,590
Kohji Furukawa.

48
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,290
I'm her son.

49
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,190
"Kohji Furukawa (22)" -That window is always open at this time of day

50
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,090
to air out the room.

51
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,290
Isn't that right, Azusa?

52
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,290
Yes.

53
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,290
You're that detective my sister hired, aren't you?

54
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,190
I pity you.

55
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,290
She's just going to use you.

56
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,990
You say use me?

57
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,390
I'm sure that's her now.

58
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,990
Yes?

59
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,590
"Etsuko Furukawa (40), Eldest Daughter TV Producer" -It's me, Etsuko.

60
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,190
I'm late. Hurry & let me in.

61
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,990
Yes, right away.

62
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,090
Mr. Mouri, I'm terribly sorry.

63
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,090
I had some last minute businesss to take care of.

64
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,390
Kohji?

65
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,690
Hi, sis, long time no see.

66
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,090
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,690
Didn't mom ban you from this house the last time you were here?

68
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,490
Shut up, this is my house.

69
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,290
And by the way, what's with that watch?

70
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,890
You said digitals were cheap stuff

71
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,090
and you wouldn't be caught dead with one.

72
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,790
Oh, I get it!

73
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,190
You had to pawn that Swiss watch you were so proud of

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,890
to pay for your debts.

75
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,190
That's none of your business!

76
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,590
By the way, Kohji,

77
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,390
I'll bet you're here to get mom to pay off your debts again, aren't you?

78
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,490
Shut up!

79
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,390
And what about you sis, hiring a private detective to butter mom up?

80
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,890
-It's so obvious. -How dare you!

81
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,490
Things seem pretty messy around here.

82
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,490
Sort of.

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,890
Ms. Etsuko's company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

84
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,090
And it seems Mr. Kohji has a lot of gambling debts

85
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,090
and some mobsters are after him.

86
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,490
But their mother Katsue has a lot of money.

87
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,790
Unfortunately, Mrs. Furukawa never lends money to those

88
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,390
she feels cannot repay her, regardless if they're her children.

89
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,190
In the past though, she did lend Kohji a lot of money

90
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,390
but it got out of hand

91
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,490
so she finally banned him from the house.

92
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,990
Azusa, what is wrong with you?

93
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,090
Yes, what is it?

94
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,090
What are you telling them?

95
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,690
I'm going to get mother!

96
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,790
She's alseep in her room, isn't she?

97
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,090
-Yes, she is. -Hey, Azusa!

98
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,490
Instead of doing everything my sister tells you,

99
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,690
you should go out with me sometime!

100
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,790
If I ask, I can get mom to forget

101
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,890
about all the money you owe her.

102
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,590
Kohji, if you have nothing better to do,

103
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,690
why don't you go out and buy something to give mom?

104
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,490
Let's go, Azusa.

105
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,490
Yes.

106
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,490
Darn.

107
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,190
About Azusa's debts...

108
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:39,090
Oh, I heard she made a stain on mom's Persian rug today.

109
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,890
Just for that, she's not getting a bonus this year.

110
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,290
And since that wasn't enough,

111
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,990
my mom made her write an IOU for the rest.

112
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,590
It's happened several times before,

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,290
One of these days, I'm sure she's going to blow up.

114
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,590
Oh, well, I guess I'll go and buy mom a little something.

115
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,690
I just hate taking sis's advice though.

116
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,790
What's with this family?

117
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,390
Mother.

118
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,990
Mother, wake up.

119
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,690
That's odd.

120
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,090
She usually gets up right away.

121
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,590
It's locked.

122
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,590
Maybe she took some of the sleeping pills the doctor prescribed and fell asleep.

123
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,290
But it's still so early.

124
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,890
-And it certainly is hot. -It is?

125
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,690
I'm sweating.

126
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,390
Oh, my goodness.

127
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,590
What was that sound?

128
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,690
Mother! Mother!

129
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,290
Mother, open this door!

130
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,490
Is something wrong?

131
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,490
Mr. Mouri, something's wrong.

132
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,090
It came from mom's room.

133
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,090
Sis!

134
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,390
Didn't you hear a weird sound from mom's room?

135
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,890
I heard a gunshot in mom's room!

136
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,290
It's locked. Do you have a spare key?

137
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,990
The key was a special order item

138
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,790
and my mom has the only one.

139
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,790
There's no other choice, we've got to break the door down.

140
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,090
Right.

141
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,090
One, two!

142
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,990
One, two...

143
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,390
It's so dark, you can't see a thing.

144
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,090
Where's the light switch?

145
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,090
On the wall to your left.

146
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,890
Mother?

147
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,990
-Mother! -You mustn't go in there!

148
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,190
But...

149
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,490
This is a murder. We have to preserve the crime scene.

150
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,890
Mother...

151
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,790
-Ran, call the police. -Alright.

152
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,490
She's been shot in the forehead.

153
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,390
She died instantaneously.

154
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,890
There're no signs of a struggle.

155
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,390
Footprints lead to the window.

156
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,490
The killer must've used that ladder.

157
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,690
But the position of the body.

158
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,690
Why you! How many times do I have to repeat myself?

159
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,390
I'm sorry!

160
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,790
Come on and get out of here!

161
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,290
The victim is Katsue Furukawa,

162
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,990
64 years old, president of a finance company.

163
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,090
The footprints around the body

164
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,590
match those we found around the ladder outside.

165
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,890
I see.

166
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,090
The victim was attacked just 3 days earlier.

167
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,890
Maybe it was the same assailant.

168
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,490
Oh, officer.

169
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,690
If someone you didn't know came in through the window,

170
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,090
wouldn't you run for the door?

171
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,590
You little brat! I told you to stay out of this!

172
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,590
No, Conan's right.

173
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,690
Since the body was near the window,

174
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,990
we can assume the victim noticed the intruder

175
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,690
and approached the window.

176
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,390
Which means the intruder was probably someone the victim knew.

177
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,190
Let's question everyone who was in the house when the murder occurred.

178
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,190
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,790
About when you discovered the body,

180
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,290
Ms. Etsuko Furukawa and Ms. Azusa Machida,

181
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,290
you two went to the victim's room on the 2nd floor to wake her up,

182
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,390
and heard the gunshot.

183
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,890
So Mr. Mouri and Mr. Kohji Furukawa

184
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,490
broke the door down and then discovered the body.

185
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,190
Am I correct so far?

186
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,190
Yes.

187
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,390
When you heard the gunshot, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?

188
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,690
I'm very certain it was when Ms. Etsuko bent down

189
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,790
to pick up the handkerchief she dropped, that's when we heard the gunshot.

190
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,890
What about after the gunshot?

191
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,590
No, nothing.

192
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,390
Inspector, just a moment!

193
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,790
How long are you going to keep us here?

194
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,990
That's right!

195
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,490
It's obvious she was killed by the same person who attacked her 3 days ago.

196
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,290
Put out an all points bulletin, do something.

197
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,990
That's already been taken care of.

198
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,890
However, judging from the position of the body,

199
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,690
there's a good chance she knew her killer!

200
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,790
She knew the killer?

201
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,590
Are we suspects?

202
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,290
I left this morning and haven't been in mom's room!

203
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,790
Inspector Megure.

204
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,190
Thank you.

205
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,590
Azusa Machida.

206
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,090
Yes.

207
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,690
It seems the victim treated you quite badly.

208
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,590
According to your neighbor, you were complaining about it this evening.

209
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,490
You said, "I'll get back at her for this!"

210
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,790
I...

211
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,390
Azusa, you didn't...

212
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,290
You finally lost your temper, right?

213
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,590
No, you're wrong. I didn't do it!

214
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,690
It's true, I did say that,

215
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,990
but let me explain.

216
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,990
I spilled some tea in the madam's room this evening.

217
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,290
I wiped everything that got wet.

218
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,590
The clock, the remote control for the television, even the rug!

219
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,490
But madam insisted I stained the rug

220
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,890
and she said she wasn't going to give me a bonus this year.

221
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,090
Then on top of that, she made me write an IOU.

222
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,490
And that's why I said what I did.

223
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,290
But like I said before, when the gunshot went off,

224
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,990
I was outside the door with Ms. Etsuko.

225
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,790
Is that correct?

226
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,490
Yes.

227
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,190
Which means you two have an alibi...

228
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,890
And Mr. Furukawa, where were you then?

229
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,390
That's a good question.

230
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,190
Kohji, as soon as your sister and Azusa went upstairs,

231
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,990
you left the living room.

232
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,190
After the gunshot, you took some time before joining us upstairs.

233
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,590
-Didn't you? -Hold on just one minute.

234
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,190
I didn't kill her.

235
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,390
Then where were you?

236
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,290
I was going to go buy mom a gift.

237
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,990
And just as I was going out the gate,

238
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,890
I heard a strange sound so I rushed back.

239
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,290
Which means you have no alibi.

240
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,090
That's...

241
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,290
Why don't we just talk about this a little more?

242
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,590
The way things stand now,

243
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,390
Kohji does seem the most suspicious.

244
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,790
But something just doesn't seem right.

245
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,090
Alright.

246
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,690
-Please go and... -Mr. Tome!

247
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,290
Hey, there you are, kid!

248
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,490
Are you here to help that famous detective again?

249
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,690
Yeah, sort of.

250
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,090
He told me to ask you if there was a cassette radio

251
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,490
or something with a timer in the room.

252
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,190
I get it, if you set the timer, you can pre-set the gunshot, right?

253
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,890
Unfortunately, we didn't find anything like that,

254
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,990
the TV's an old model and it doesn't have a timer either.

255
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,490
I was wrong.

256
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,190
Thank you, Mr. Tome.

257
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,490
Okay.

258
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,890
Good hunting, little detective!

259
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,790
I was so sure there was a trick behind t that gunshot.

260
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,590
A blue-white light?

261
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,590
What nonsense are you talking about?

262
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,090
It's true!

263
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,690
Just before the gunshot, I happened to look up at mom's room.

264
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,290
And her room was lit up with a blue-white Iight

265
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,590
but it got dark right after that again.

266
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,390
You've got to believe me!

267
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,490
A blue-white light?

268
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,890
But Mr. Tome just told me...

269
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,390
What's going on here?

270
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,390
I've got it.

271
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,890
You can do it that way.

272
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,790
That's why that thing was there.

273
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,790
Hello.

274
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,890
Yes. Is it?

275
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,790
Thank you very much.

276
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,690
I knew it.

277
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,890
You're smart to pick up on that, kid.

278
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,690
That struck me as strange, too.

279
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,790
Now I have got all the evidence.

280
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,890
That person is the killer!

281
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,260
Hey, Conan!

282
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,460
Good grief, where's this solid proof you were talking about?

283
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,560
Here it comes.

284
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,860
It's happening again.

285
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,660
I'm counting on you, Pops.

286
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,260
Mouri!

287
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,760
Is it true that you know who the killer is?

288
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,060
Hey, Mouri...

289
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,160
I know that look!

290
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,060
Yes, Inspector Megure, I've figured everything out.

291
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Have everyone come here to this room, please.

292
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,160
You've got it!

293
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,960
So everyone's present?

294
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,460
First of all, Inspector Megure, judging from the position of the body,

295
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,760
you've deducted the victim knew the killer, didn't you?

296
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,960
But when we broke the door down and entered the room,

297
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,760
the lights were all off.

298
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
What?

299
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,960
Then how did the victim see the killer's face?

300
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Wait, you mean...

301
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
That's right.

302
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Mrs. Furukawa was killed earlier in the day

303
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,760
while there was still sunlight.

304
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,860
Are you sure?

305
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,760
But what about the gunshot we all heard?

306
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,060
That gunshot was staged by the killer to be used as an alibi.

307
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,260
The killer took the remote control for the television

308
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,660
and switched it on later to play the television.

309
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,460
But Mouri,

310
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,960
doesn't that mean the killer had to have prior knowledge

311
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,260
of the exact time the gunshot would be heard on television?

312
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,260
How could anyone...

313
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Sis.

314
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,060
That's right, there's only one person here

315
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,460
who would know the exact time

316
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,260
a gunshot would be heard on the television.

317
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,860
The gunshot was heard at about 7:30.

318
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,760
7:29 and 32 seconds to be exact.

319
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,660
It's the exact time a gun is shot

320
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,460
in a show Ms. Furukawa's company produces.

321
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,260
Yes, Ms. Etsuko Furukawa, you are the murderer!

322
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,060
The crime probably took place like this.

323
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,160
In the evening,

324
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,960
Ms. Furukawa climbed in through the window.

325
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,060
Her mother sees her and goes to the window.

326
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,760
And is shot by a gun with a silencer.

327
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Ms. Furukawa then changed her clothes

328
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,660
and came to meet with us, acting as if nothing had happened.

329
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,060
Then calculating the time,

330
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,160
she took Azusa, who would act as her witness, upstairs

331
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,460
and deliberately dropped her handkerchief.

332
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Then pretends to pick it up as she presses the remote control button.

333
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,260
Did I made any mistakes anywhere?

334
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,560
I see.

335
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,160
So the blue-white light Kohji was talking about was from the television.

336
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,960
If even a second was off

337
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,460
from the timing of switching the remote control on,

338
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,060
other noises would have been heard and the trick wouldn't have worked.

339
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,860
That's why you wore a digital watch today, isn't that right?

340
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,860
And it was also you who broke the TV in living room, wasn't it?

341
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,060
When the gunshot was heard upstairs, it would've been suspicious

342
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,460
if the same sound came from the television downstairs, wouldn't it?

343
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,960
Can... can you prove any of this?

344
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,260
Do you have any proof I did it?

345
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,160
Of course, I do!

346
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,960
When the body was found, you pretended to cry and crouched down.

347
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,860
When no one was looking, you took the remote control out,

348
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,760
then slid it on the rug

349
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,460
and returned it under the table, didn't you?

350
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,860
But you put a little too much strength into it,

351
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,760
it was supposed to look Iike it fell from the table.

352
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,760
But it slid under the legs instead.

353
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,060
Your fingerprints were on that remote control.

354
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,460
Of course, they would be!

355
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,960
I go in and out of this room practically every day!

356
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,560
But earlier you said you left the room this morning and never returned.

357
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,860
I was talking about today.

358
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,960
But I was in here yesterday and the day before, too.

359
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,060
Oh, really?

360
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,360
By the way, Azusa.

361
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
Yes?

362
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,560
What did you do with the remote control when you spilled the tea?

363
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,760
I told you, the tea spilled on it,

364
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,860
so I wiped it clean.

365
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,360
You're lying! I bet you forgot to wipe it!

366
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,860
I did not forgot! I wiped it absolutely clean!

367
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,460
That's enough, this argument is getting us nowhere.

368
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,960
Tome, please explain to everyone!

369
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,660
Yes, sir.

370
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,560
Can I begin?

371
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,360
Anytime.

372
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,860
We found two sets of fingerprints

373
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,160
on the remote control found on the scene.

374
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,460
One, the left hand print of Ms. Etsuko Furukawa,

375
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,260
including the thumb to baby finger and palm print.

376
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,660
Second, the left hand print of Ms. Azusa Machida

377
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,760
including the thumb to baby finger and palm print.

378
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,460
See, what did I tell you?

379
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,860
Your prints are on it, too.

380
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
But, I...

381
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Is that all, Mr. Tome?

382
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,160
That's all.

383
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,460
Then that settles it.

384
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,560
What do you mean by that?

385
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,460
Azusa didn't forget to wipe the remote control.

386
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,760
But just now...

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Something was missing!

388
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,960
If she had forgotten to wipe the remote control,

389
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,560
something else had to be on it.

390
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,460
Katsue Furukawa's fingerprints, it was her room

391
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,360
and since she's always handling the remote control,

392
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,860
her prints should have been on it.

393
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,260
It was all her fault...

394
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,660
She knew I was having financial problems

395
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,960
but she wouldn't lend me a single cent.

396
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,260
Yet she'd pay off all of Kohji's gambling debts.

397
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,360
It was always that way!

398
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,560
It was always Kohji this, Kohji that.

399
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,360
She pampered him because she gave birth to him in her later years.

400
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,160
Kohji was everything.

401
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,860
Sis.

402
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,660
Ms. Furukawa.

403
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,860
It's not that I don't understand how you feel.

404
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,160
I do, but think about it,

405
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,060
you've just committed a murder!

406
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,860
You've killed your own mother!

407
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,760
I want you to think deeply about what you did.

408
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,060
There, that should do it.

409
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,660
It works.

410
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,760
Thank you so much.

411
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,160
It was nothing.

412
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
He may not flook it but Mr. Takagi's a video freak.

413
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,260
He s goes to rent videos every night, he's addicted...

414
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,760
Gunshots!

415
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,360
Look out!

416
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I've got a case to solve.

417
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,760
Somebody tell him it's already over.

418
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,200
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,260
"Stray Bullet"

420
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,680
The next episode is the part of a special series.

421
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,860
Watch all the episodes and maybe you'll meet "you know who".
