the best time is before you get married.

15
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,117
Cut it out, dad.

00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:21,369
Come on, Dad. Hurry up and get ready.

Huh? Wasn't dinner supposed to be at 10:00?

It's still 6:30.

So, let's leave early and go pick mom up.

20
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:33,369
Pick her up? You mean at her office?

21

No, at the beauty shop.

just so that she could go have her hair cut?

What's the problem?

After all, she's trying to look nice for you, dad.

Cut out the crap! There's no such side to her!

Is that why you're cutting my hair in the bathroom instead of your shop,

41

so you can avoid the eyes of other people?

Yes. I just need you to cut the ends of my hair evenly.

Okay, I'll start by washing your hair then,

No big deal. After all, you've nothing to do, anyway.

Mom was saying her appointment is at 8:00,

to the point of getting sick of it when I was young!

77
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,669
But you sure decided quickly to go and pick her up, Pops.

78
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,969
Okay, hair dye all done!

79

Yes. I'm going to drop by at the convenience store

83

84
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,327

00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,169
so I guess I'll go get some good stories from him.

92
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,369
Then I've got to set your hair nicer than usual tonight!

93
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:12,969
I'll hear you out on your love stories about your husband

94
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,169
while I'm cutting your hair.

95
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,469
It's not lovey-dovey stories that I want to talk about, but complaints.

96
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:21,769
If I remember correctly,

97
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:25,669
the beauty shop was somewhere right up this slope.

98
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,069
It's been a while since you've both met,

99
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,369
-so talk nicely, okay, dad! -Yeah.

100
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,369
I'll make sure that I give it to that old lady tonight.

101
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,375
What was that?

102
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:37,969
Not again?

103
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,383
What was that sound all about?

104
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:48,387
It sounded like something bump into something then, dropped.

105
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,669
But nothing looks to have been dropped anywhere.

106
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,393
It doesn't seem like anything hit a car either.

107
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,769
Maybe it's that.

108
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:00,069
Look, on top of the trash below in the trash dump.

109
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,969
What is it?

110
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,769
Hey, isn't that the body of a person?

111
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,411
Call an ambulance and the police right away.

112
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,069
What? What's that sound?

113
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,421
How do you like it?

114
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,425
Thank you, it's perfect!

115
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,427
Thank for waiting.

116
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,431
Doesn't it sort of sound noisy outside?

117
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,969
It seems as if something has happened.

118
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,869
The sirens of police cars can be heard, too.

119
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:39,669
Would you like to go take a look?

120
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,369
Yes, I guess so.

121
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:44,769
But if it's a crime, it's more my husband's job than mine.

122
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,445
I guess so.

123
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,969
No. What I need is

124
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,469
to be defended by you, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

125
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,969
Back down, back down!

126
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,769
From the driver's license he had on him,

127
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,369
the victim is Mr. Shiro Eisaku, age 28.

128
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:09,369
The cause of his death is loss of blood from being slashed in the neck.

129
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,869
If we take into account, Mr. Mouri's story saying

130
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:14,469
that he coincidentally heard something drop,

131
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,269
after the victim was slashed in the neck,

132
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,769
his body was thrown over that guard rail on the road above over there,

133
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,769
then fell in here.

134
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:26,069
But when we heard the sound from the road above,

135
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:28,969
there was no one in sight.

136
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,369
-Is that true? -Yes.

137
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:36,069
It could be that the body was thrown from the bed of a vehicle

138
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:40,069
with a high body like a truck.

139
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:43,969
But I don't think I heard sounds of a truck.

140
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:45,469
Right.

141
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,505
What we heard were three sounds,

142
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,769
the sound of something bumping into something,

143
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,269
the sound of something falling

144
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,669
and a rattling sound like something was being rolled along!

145
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,569
So, you heard a crash, thud and rattling sound?

146
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,269
Well, so much for the sound,

147
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,669
but if a body were to be thrown over,

148
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,069
the culprit would most likely have had to be a man.

149
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,869
Right. And not just an ordinary man,

150
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:11,269
but a strong and stout wrestler or something.

151
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,869
A wrestler?

152
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,533
Inspector, don't you know?

153
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,969
The victim is Shiro Eisaku, a wrestler

154
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:21,269
who was scheduled to challenge the champion!

155
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,269
He was famous for not letting his opponents attack him from behind,

156
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,545
and weighed 90 kilograms.

157
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,969
Anyone who could've slashed the throat of this man,

158
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,549
then throw him over ever so lightly,

159
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,969
has to be someone who is nimble as well as super muscular.

160
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,569
No.

161
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,869
A woman could've slashed his throat too, don't you think?

162
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,269
Although that depends on the condition this man was in

163
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,769
during the time he was killed.

164
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,669
You!

165
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:48,169
Eri, why are you here?

166
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,069
That's for me to say.

167
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,969
I mean, the cafe that we were going to eat at

168
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:54,573
is not in this direction, is it?

169
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,575
Well...

170
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,969
We just happened to be here!

171
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:03,269
Well, at any rate, if the victim is a wrestler,

172
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,969
let's investigate all the wrestlers

173
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,585
that may have had a grudge against him to start!

174
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,869
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,869
How stupid can the police get.

176
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:14,593
They can go snooping around all the wrestlers they want.

177
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,169
No matter how hard they check,

178
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,597
they'll probably never track the culprit down

179
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,869
to a nobody beautician like me.

180
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:27,269
You live in the neighborhood, don't you?

181
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:29,569
Yes, I guess.

182
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:32,611
Do you know of any barber or beauty shop near here?

183
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,369
Conan, why are you asking her something like that?

184
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:42,369
Because, when I looked at the throat of the man who died,

185
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:46,625
I saw a lot of small cut strands of hair mixed with blood!

186
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,169
What? Really?

187
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,069
You're right!

188
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:59,069
I just thought that

189
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:03,469
maybe he went to get his hair cut before he was killed!

190
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:04,643
I see.

191
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:07,869
Besides, the blood flowing from his neck

192
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,649
has a strange looking uneven spot to it.

193
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,653
Now that you mentioned it!

194
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,669
Isn't this because when he was slashed in the throat,

195
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,669
he had a cape or towel on?

196
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,169
I see!

197
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:24,663
If the culprit is a barber or a beautician,

198
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,869
be it that the victim is a super strong wrestler,

199
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:30,669
it would be easy to poke a sharp object

200
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,169
from behind him without being suspected!

201
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:39,669
What's up, Takagi?

202
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:43,869
Well, Conan happened to notice something strange just now.

203
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,769
I see. In other words,

204
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:54,693
it is most likely that the barber or beautician is a super macho guy.

205
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:55,869
Yeah.

206
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:59,869
A man who could carry this man ever so lightly.

207
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,169
I'll go check to see

208
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:05,569
if there's such a person in this neighborhood then.

209
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,569
If so, why not ask her?

210
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,569
She may know somebody

211
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:14,069
because she's also a barber or beautician herself.

212
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:17,069
Right, Miss?

213
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,717
What the?

214
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,719
What is it?

215
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,721
This boy...

216
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,069
What's with him anyway?

217
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:33,877
She's also a barber or beautician herself.

218
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,077
Right, Miss?

219
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:39,677
You are?

220
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,739
Yes.

221
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,177
Yes!

222
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:45,777
She was cutting my hair for me till just a while ago.

223
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:47,777
Which means that the beauty shop

224
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:49,077
that you had an appointment at today was...

225
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:52,077
Yes, at Ms. Hasaka's shop.

226
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:55,777
I hear that this shop is originally her late father's shop, though.

227
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,277
Conan, it's amazing

228
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,177
that you figured out she was a beautician.

229
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,277
Her hands!

230
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:03,677
She has a corn on the second joint

231
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,477
of her ring finger of her right hand, doesn't she?

232
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:09,777
Excuse me, please show me your right hand.

233
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,177
Yes.

234
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:13,977
Excuse me.

235
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,277
Yes, she does.

236
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,777
That's corn was made because she has to let her ring finger

237
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,377
through the loop of the handle of the scissors all the time!

238
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,777
I see.

239
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:24,177
And if you look even closer,

240
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:27,577
the color of her nails are kind of brownish too, right?

241
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:30,577
That's because she's always using chemicals to dye

242
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:33,477
and shampoo the hair of her customers.

243
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:37,277
How come you know all this stuff?

244
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:41,177
I saw it on a TV special on beauticians.

245
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,577
TV again. You're watching too much TV!

246
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:47,677
It's way better than you watching the horse races, dad.

247
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:50,177
The horse races are a must for men!

248
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,177
Is that so?

249
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:57,877
Well, then how many barbers and beauty shops are there

250
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,177
in this area, do you know?

251
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,177
Well, you see, Mr. Shiro Eisaku who was killed

252
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,577
is a wrestler who weighed 90 kilograms!

253
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,827
Mr. Mouri and his party here, who happened to pass by

254
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:12,177
heard the sound of something falling.

255
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:16,377
Moreover, a lot of cut pieces of his blonde hair

256
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:19,677
was mixed in the blood around his neck.

257
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:20,839
And considering that

258
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,577
there was an uneven spot in the blood around his neck,

259
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,845
it can be deduced that Mr. Eisaku was having his hair cut

260
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,847
when he was slashed in the neck with a sharp object,

261
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,851
then thrown out from somewhere.

262
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,177
Will you please help us and tell us

263
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:37,777
if you know of any barber or beautician in this area

264
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:42,877
that would be able to carry a guy like him up?

265
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:46,865
Yes. Well, there are 2 or 3 others besides this shop here,

266
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:50,277
but I don't know if there's anyone that strong in any of those shops.

267
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:53,577
You're pretty mean, aren't you?

268
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,377
Because when I asked you a while ago

269
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,877
whether you knew of any barbers or beauty shops near here,

270
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,577
you didn't answer me!

271
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:04,377
Why didn't you tell me back then

272
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:06,477
that you owned a beauty shop too?

273
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,887
-That's because... -You're meaner,

274
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,377
asking her that question, despite already knowing all that!

275
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:13,577
But...

276
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:15,377
No buts!

277
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,897
Now, keep an eye on him

278
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,377
so he doesn't go running here and there!

279
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:22,477
Yes.

280
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:25,277
I couldn't answer you right away

281
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:27,877
because I was a bit flustered, you see.

282
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:30,077
-Flustered? -Yes, sir.

283
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:33,677
I came and found out that the victim was him, so...

284
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:37,777
Do you know the victim Mr. Eisaku?

285
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:40,177
I know you'll find out later anyway,

286
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:41,977
so let me tell you from my side.

287
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:44,923
We used to be classmates in high school.

288
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,577
There was a time when I used to go with him too.

289
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:50,929
Then, Mr. Eisaku used to come to your shop too?

290
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,577
Yes, he used to come here often to get a hair cut

291
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,277
until he got engaged.

292
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:56,935
Engaged?

293
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,877
Come to think of it, I saw an article in the sports newspaper!

294
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,477
If so, there could be a motive here too.

295
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:04,943
Ms. Hasaka.

296
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,947
You could also have a motive for wanting to kill Mr. Eisaku!

297
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:13,677
Hold it!

298
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,177
What a thing to say out of the blue, just like that?

299
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:21,477
If a woman lives near the place where her ex-boyfriend is found dead,

300
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:23,777
it's only natural to suspect her, isn't it?

301
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:26,965
How can you jump to such illogical conclusions?

302
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,277
-Officer Takagi. -Yes?

303
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:32,377
What is the estimated time of his death?

304
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:38,977
Mr. Mouri found the body at about 20:30.

305
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:42,577
So, it was probably about 20 minutes before that.

306
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:45,477
If so, she couldn't have committed the crime!

307
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:50,989
Because she was doing my hair all the while from 20:00 to 21:00!

308
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,993
Are you sure she was with you, right through?

309
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,677
Yes, she was beside me, practically the whole time through.

310
00:16:57,677 --> 00:17:00,999
Well, she did leave to attend to some matters in between,

311
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,277
but that was just for about 10 minutes.

312
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:06,277
Then, she could've used those 10 minutes to...

313
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,377
No way!

314
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:11,377
Her beauty shop is farther up above this slope, you know!

315
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,177
It's too far a place for her to slash the throat of a big man,

316
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:15,877
then carry him over here!

317
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:18,077
But...

318
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:20,077
But what?

319
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:28,077
Oh no. Mom and dad are glaring at each other again.

320
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:34,577
But, if what Eri said a while ago is true...

321
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:39,877
Would you like to come to my shop?

322
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:50,677
I guess this kind of thing off and on is not bad.

323
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,077
Turn left at that intersection over there.

324
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,477
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

325
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:03,061
When making a turn at the intersection,

326
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,077
you're supposed to turn on your blinkers early, and check both sides!

327
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:07,077
Keep to the traffic rules, will you?

328
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:10,477
Oh boy. Then, why ride with me?

329
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,071
That's my shop over there.

330
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,377
What?

331
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:21,877
Conan!

332
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,083
What a terrible driving!

333
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,877
It would've been better to walk here than take the car!

334
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:32,477
-Are you all right? -Yep.

335
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,077
I see.

336
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,577
Ms. Kisaki, you were sitting here,

337
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:39,577
having your hair cut by Ms. Hasaka?

338
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,577
Yes.

339
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,977
She always cuts my hair for me after work,

340
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:47,105
and today I had an appointment at 20:00.

341
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:49,107
I got to the shop at 20:00.

342
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:52,677
She started then and shampooed me for 10 minutes.

343
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,113
Dying my hair took 20 minutes.

344
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,877
Shampooing me again took 10 minutes.

345
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:59,117
Giving me a perm took 10 minutes,

346
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,119
she shampooed me again for 10 minutes.

347
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,121
Then cutting my hair took 15 minutes.

348
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,123
Then the last shampooing took 10 minutes.

349
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,077
Finally, blow drying and setting my hair took 10 minutes.

350
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:11,477
It took about an hour to finish everything, didn't it?

351
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:12,677
Yes.

352
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,133
You sure have fantastic memory.

353
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,477
She always does it for me,

354
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:21,139
and besides, I was supposed to go out to dinner with somebody afterwards.

355
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,877
So, I kept glancing at the clock.

356
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:27,145
And? When and where did you go off to attend to your matters?

357
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:28,677
During the waiting time for the color

358
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:31,177
to set into my hair after she dyed it.

359
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:34,377
If I remember correctly, I think it was

360
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:36,577
for 10 minutes between 20:20 to 20:30.

361
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,277
Yes.

362
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,477
For 10 minutes, between 20:20 to 20:30...

363
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:46,477
Then, she probably used that time to kill him!

364
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,377
By car, it doesn't take 3 minutes

365
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:50,377
to get from the scene of the crime to here.

366
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,877
You know...

367
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,977
I don't have a driver's license,

368
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,777
and all I did was throw out the trash and go to the convenience store.

369
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:00,077
-Throw out the trash? -Yes.

370
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:02,177
I threw the trash out at the trash dump

371
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:03,181
beside the convenience store where I went shopping.

372
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,183
-The convenience store? -Yes.

373
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,377
It's close by, so shall we go there too?

374
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,077
Please come this way.

375
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,461
-A back road. -Yes.

376
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:18,267
This way is faster than taking the main road.

377
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,067
Whose scooter is this?

378
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:23,967
It's a keepsake of my late father, and I'm riding it now!

379
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,467
I used it when I went to the convenience store a while ago too

380
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,667
because I bought a bag of rice.

381
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,767
Then, you placed the body in the back of the scooter and...

382
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,267
-Idiot! -What?

383
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,267
It's more than difficult trying to just put a person

384
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,567
weighing 90 kilograms in the back of a scooter,

385
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,267
and you're saying that she fixed the body on

386
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:43,221
and moved it some place without anybody noticing? No way!

387
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:47,767
Just how do propose she threw the body down from that position?

388
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,967
That's why, I was just stating a possibility.

389
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:55,233
And how do you get to the convenience store?

390
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:58,067
Yes. If you take that side road over there,

391
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:00,567
it takes you to the road in front of the convenience store.

392
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,241
Hey!

393
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,567
Is that way the direction where the trash dump

394
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,245
that the body was found is?

395
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:08,467
Yes.

396
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,167
Hey, Conan.

397
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,257
Just as I thought.

398
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,967
The trash dump where the body was found

399
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:23,967
is two stories below right up ahead.

400
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:28,167
But, unless you use a crane or something,

401
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,467
it would be impossible to throw a person over into the trash dump.

402
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:35,667
A popular wrestler Mr. Shiro Eisaku is killed

403
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:39,067
and his dead body is found in a trash dump.

404
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,967
Back then, we heard three sounds.

405
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,767
I wonder what that sounds were of?

406
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,767
Mr. Eisaku was killed

407
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:55,767
when he was getting his hair cut at a barber or a beauty salon.

408
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:59,567
If so, the most suspicious person would be Ms. Minayo Hasaka

409
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,299
who runs a beauty shop in the neighborhood.

410
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,867
Minayo also used to be Mr. Eisaku's ex-girlfriend.

411
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:10,567
However, Minayo was doing Eri Kisaki's hair from 20:00 to 21:00.

412
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,311
Minayo was away from Ms. Kisaki

413
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,867
only for 10 minutes from 20:20.

414
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,867
If Minayo is the killer,

415
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:21,319
how did she take Mr. Eisaku's body which is 90 kilograms

416
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,867
to the trash dump in a matter of 10 minutes?

417
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:29,327
Is Minayo really the killer?

418
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,467
And, what exactly were causing

419
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,767
the three sounds that we heard back then?

420
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,060
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,300
"A Motor Scooter"

422
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,610
This case is totally Greek to me.

423
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,424
Are you into greeking (gibberish) or something?

424
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:10,932
-Why? -You always look puzzled.

425
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:11,860
Hey, you!
