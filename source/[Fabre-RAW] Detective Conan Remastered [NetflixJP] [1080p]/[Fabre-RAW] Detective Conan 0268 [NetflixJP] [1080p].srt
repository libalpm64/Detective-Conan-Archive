1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,920
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,220
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,920
It has been three days since the murder case happened.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,820
What's the destiny of Ran and Sonoko?

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,420
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,420
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,620
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,080
We all came to a lodge called Suito Mountain Lodge

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,980
located in a remote mountain area

10
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,780
together with Sonoko who invited us.

11
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,480
However, one of the guests staying at the lodge,

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,880
a journalist named Yoshitaka Nigaki

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,380
fails to return to the lodge

14
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,480
after going into the woods despite a violent blizzard.

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,880
After a while of searching for Mr. Nigaki in the woods,

16
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,880
we found him dead.

17
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,580
Just as I thought.

18
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,280
I've figured out the case.

19
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,380
Now I know why there were black pictures

20
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,980
taken before the blood-stained picture.

21
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,080
Who took the chocolate out

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
and why it was put near the corpse.

23
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,880
And who killed Mr. Nigaki.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,180
It's that person!

25
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,380
"Bloody Valentine (Case Solved)"

26
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,680
Now, all I need is the evidence.

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,780
The evidence of the one who took the chocolate out of here.

28
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,680
So long as I can get some evidence

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,980
of the one who killed Mr. Nigaki...

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Sonoko's chocolate is the one in the foreground.

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,580
The checkered one next to it is Mika's chocolate.

32
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,380
Then, Ran's is...

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,980
Ran.

34
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,780
Hey, what are you doing?

35
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,280
Huh?

36
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,080
How come he's here?

37
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,880
What?

38
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,980
You found out who the killer is?

39
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,780
Are you serious, sonny?

40
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,580
So, who is it?

41
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,180
Is it that man with the black knitted cap?

42
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,580
Well, Pops says he'll explain all that

43
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,980
in the kitchen to you from now.

44
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,080
All right. We're here, Mr. Detective.

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,680
Now that you know who the killer is...

46
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,780
Does that mean that you've figured out

47
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,680
the identity of the man wearing the black knitted cap?

48
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,280
No, there is no need to check on the identity of that man.

49
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,580
Because the one who killed Mr. Nigaki is right here.

50
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,780
What?

51
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,280
Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,180
I thought we already told you that it was impossible for us

53
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,480
to put the chocolate near the corpse

54
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
under the situation we were in!

55
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,980
Right, the chocolate.

56
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,780
The key to solving that mystery was not us,

57
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,280
but him.

58
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,680
Saburo?

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Then, you mean the one who is holding the case

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,980
is Saburo?

61
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,880
Yes. Thanks to him,

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I've figured out the mystery of

63
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,780
why the chocolate was near Mr. Nigaki's corpse.

64
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,980
Are you saying that the dog was the one

65
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,080
who brought the chocolate out here?

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,780
After you guys left the chocolate here

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,880
and went to look for Nigaki,

68
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
that dog was brought outside by the boy with glasses, right?

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,380
If the boy who was together with the dog

70
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,080
was the first to find the corpse,

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
how did the dog get the chocolate?

72
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,580
Yes, it's true that the dog was with Conan.

73
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,080
This Saburo definitely was.

74
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,280
This Saburo?

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,480
Yes.

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,680
I realized this when I saw Saburo liking round things

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,080
to the point of playing with the daruma

78
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,780
showed no interest at all in the video that we watched last night.

79
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,680
When I heard that the previous owner used to take

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,780
Saburo and go visit the grave everyday,

81
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,980
and taking into consideration that

82
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,980
only specific graves were not attacked by wild animals.

83
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,780
This assumption was easy to come by.

84
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,280
The previous owner probably made Saburo keep watch over

85
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,880
his wife's grave all day.

86
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,880
Just what are you talking about?

87
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,780
How did the dog that was being put back in his cage every night

88
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,880
watch the grave?

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,480
It is impossible as you say.

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,980
If there is only one dog.

91
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
-What? -What?

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,480
You know about it, granny, don't you?

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,180
About the dog that your husband told you died 12 years ago.

94
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,580
Saburo and the existence of Jiro who had two nails.

95
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,880
Well, I should've realized it

96
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,480
when I saw the dent on the chocolate and the melted part of it.

97
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,380
The fact that there were two Saburos,

98
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,680
and that the marks on the chocolate

99
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,380
was made by a dog holding it in its mouth.

100
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
What?

101
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,280
To put it accurately, one of them is Jiro.

102
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,580
Each time they went to the grave,

103
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,080
they watched over it alternately.

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,680
The previous owner probably lied saying that Jiro had died

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,680
out of his consideration for granny.

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,180
I see.

107
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,580
If that's how he was trained.

108
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,380
Then he would eat only every other day.

109
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,780
That's why he didn't eat when he couldn't go out on stormy days

110
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,280
and change places.

111
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Then, the wolf that Mr. Nigaki said he saw in the woods was...

112
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,980
Probably either Jiro or Saburo.

113
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,580
They were also delivering chocolate to the victims of accidents.

114
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,980
That's ridiculous!

115
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,080
Why would a mere dog carry off chocolate?

116
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,280
They are not "mere dogs".

117
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
They are life saver rescue dogs,

118
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,680
efficient enough to win awards for saving lives!

119
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,480
It can all be explained if they were trained to give chocolate

120
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,580
that is highly nutritious to accident victims.

121
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,980
And that the actions of the dogs doing so

122
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,880
was limited to this time of year

123
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,280
when a large amount of chocolate was stocked.

124
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,480
The blood on Mr. Nigaki's face was wiped off part way

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,580
because the dog thought he was a victim of an accident

126
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,280
and tried to lick him to wake him up.

127
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,780
Hey, wait!

128
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
If the dog was the one who took the chocolate,

129
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,980
then anybody could've committed the crime.

130
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,480
Just what are you talking about?

131
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,880
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

132
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,180
The blood stained picture I showed you during the day!

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,380
In other words,

134
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,580
the killer is one of you two who have no alibi

135
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,180
during the day to back you up.

136
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,280
Don't you think there's something odd about that picture?

137
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Huh?

138
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,280
That picture was the last one in the film

139
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,780
and it was wound after that.

140
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,780
The killer would've most naturally heard

141
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,980
the sound of the buzzing sound of the film being wound.

142
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,280
But the killer did not take that film away.

143
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Despite the fact that the killer might be in the picture.

144
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,680
True.

145
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,280
But, why?

146
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,080
That's because that picture was not taken at the time of the crime.

147
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,480
It was a picture that Mr Nigaki had casually taken during the day.

148
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,580
Unaware at that time that his blood stains

149
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,280
were already on the lens from the night before.

150
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,780
Last night? You mean the night he cut his finger with the knife?

151
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,080
Yes. The blood that stained only the stomach part of the parker

152
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,180
he was wearing back then is the evidence.

153
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,080
It's most likely that the blood stained

154
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,280
the camera lens that was hanging from his neck.

155
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,480
Yes.

156
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,280
The killer made Mr. Nigaki take pictures with the camera

157
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,380
with blood stains on its lens during the day,

158
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,280
and promised to meet him that evening.

159
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,180
Hit and killed him then put his sunglasses back on him.

160
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,980
This way, the killer made it look like Mr. Nigaki

161
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,380
was killed during the day.

162
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
In other words,

163
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,380
no one else other than you can be the killer.

164
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,080
In other words,

165
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,980
no one else other than you can be the killer,

166
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,480
Ms. Ako Amari.

167
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,580
Huh?

168
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
It can't be.

169
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,680
How can Ako be the killer?

170
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
It can't be!

171
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,680
Because we went to look for him after the blizzard started,

172
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
and the sun was still high!

173
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,680
That's why you went to get him earlier.

174
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,980
Because if the blizzard got worse

175
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,480
and he decided to return to the lodge

176
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,180
before the time he promised to meet her,

177
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,880
everything would be in vain.

178
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,080
By the way,

179
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,880
the reason why there were two black pictures

180
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,680
before the picture with the blood stain on it

181
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,180
was to leave room for just one mere picture.

182
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,280
If space for three more pictures are left,

183
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,680
then the other two pictures would also have blood stains on them,

184
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
and the pictures would turn out strange.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,380
She probably switched all the other films and video tapes

186
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,180
to unused ones for the same reason.

187
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,280
But I could've used the same trick too if I wanted to.

188
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,680
No, only Ms. Ako could've done it.

189
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,180
In order to keep the blood stained film inside the camera

190
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,080
after the crime was committed,

191
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,280
the trick wouldn't work unless all the films

192
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,680
that he had in his backpack are completely were moved beforehand.

193
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,080
If there are other used films in his knapsack

194
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,380
after the crime is committed,

195
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,780
it would be impossible to tell

196
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,580
which film is the one with the blood stain.

197
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,080
That's right.

198
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,180
Since you were with him taking care of his wound,

199
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,580
you're the only one who could've removed the films

200
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,780
without being suspected at all.

201
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,880
Would you like to take a look at them?

202
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,980
The tapes that you collected and disposed of

203
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,680
after committing the crime?

204
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Huh?

205
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,880
A picture of you that Mr. Nigaki took

206
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,080
when you went to meet him in the blizzard.

207
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,480
He delivered it to us.

208
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,880
He probably thought that you had forgotten it

209
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,380
and brought the bag with lots of video tapes in it back here.

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,080
I haven't confirmed the contents of the tapes yet,

211
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,380
but tapes from four years ago are among them, too.

212
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,080
That is most likely...

213
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,280
That's right.

214
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,580
It's the scene of the previous owner

215
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,780
trying to help my older brother who was hurt and couldn't move

216
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,680
get buried under an avalanche.

217
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,580
It's a cruel tape

218
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,380
that was being filmed from the woods in the distance.

219
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,680
Don't tell me that Mr. Nigaki kept rolling the film

220
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
without going to help at all?

221
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,880
Yes.

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,380
Because my brother was against me going steady with him.

223
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,280
I found that tape when I was looking for clothes for him

224
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,080
to change in after Yoshitaka got hurt.

225
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,680
After seeing the date of four years ago,

226
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,780
I figured that this was the present he was going to give me

227
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,580
and watched it in secret.

228
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,580
That's why you were crying.

229
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,580
I didn't think that Saburo was going to take my chocolate to him.

230
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,680
Maybe Saburo already knew what I was going to do.

231
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,480
He probably knew that I was the killer, too.

232
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
As well as the fact that I really did love Yoshitaka.

233
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,280
What a stupid thing to do.

234
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,580
You don't even know if Mr. Nigaki really filmed it either.

235
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,280
I know he did.

236
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,480
There was some loud sound before the avalanche came,

237
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,280
and his voice was in the tape too.

238
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,880
He said, "Sorry, Natsuya. I'll be taking your little sister."

239
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Some loud sound?

240
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,880
Hey, wait a second. That's...

241
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,480
It's this sound that you heard on the tape, isn't it?

242
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,180
Right.

243
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,180
We're the ones who caused that avalanche.

244
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,080
We mistook her older brother for a wolf and shot him.

245
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,480
We were called out here

246
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
by Nigaki as he wanted to blackmail us.

247
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,680
He told us that

248
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,480
if the whereabouts of the corpse was found through the video

249
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,280
and a bullet is found in his body,

250
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,380
we would be finished.

251
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,780
Thanks for getting rid of him for us.

252
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,180
Either way,

253
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,480
we were going to cause an avalanche

254
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
to stall him and kill him slow and easy.

255
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,280
All of you, line up beside the detective!

256
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,680
Hurry up!

257
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,780
What do I do now?

258
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,580
I've already used the anesthesia gun

259
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
and I don't have my super kick shoes either.

260
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,180
So, how shall we cook you guys?

261
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,080
Somebody... somebody, please help us.

262
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,880
Otherwise, I won't be able to give him this chocolate.

263
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,180
Okay, the girl with the brown hair!

264
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,080
Stab your friend with the knife that's behind you!

265
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,180
What?

266
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,480
Come on, quit stalling!

267
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Who is it?

268
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,180
Hey, go take a look!

269
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,880
Okay.

270
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Hey, is anybody there?

271
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,980
Who are you?

272
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Stop!

273
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,980
Don't move!

274
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,280
Hey, I'm telling you, don't move!

275
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,380
Don't move.

276
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,780
Don't worry.

277
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,080
If I concentrate on the direction of the gun barrel

278
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,580
and his finger on the trigger,

279
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,380
I can dodge the bullet.

280
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,080
Darn you! Don't take me lightly!

281
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,780
I'm not taking you lightly.

282
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,380
I was just stating fact.

283
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,880
Darn it!

284
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,480
If you think you can dodge my bullet, go ahead and try!

285
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,780
See?

286
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,380
Makoto.

287
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,780
You rat!

288
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,280
Over here!

289
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,480
Over here!

290
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,580
That must've hurt.

291
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,980
Makoto, what brings you heme?

292
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,880
I came to check out the man you car for.

293
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
To see if he is really good for you.

294
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,180
Huh?

295
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,980
Please don't play dumb with me!

296
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,080
The one that you made the hand knitted sweater for,

297
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,380
the one you bought the tea cup for,

298
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,180
and the guy's whose going to receive the chocolate you made.

299
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,780
Where is that lucky guy?

300
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,580
It's you.

301
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,680
Huh?

302
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,980
See.

303
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,880
By the way, although Sonoko quit knitting the sweater half finished,

304
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,880
she did send you the tea cup.

305
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,580
Oh, I thought that was a flower vase.

306
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,380
Is everything clear now?

307
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,980
Oh, yes.

308
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,080
I guess I'll be on my way, then.

309
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,580
Hey, wait a minute!

310
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,880
You've come all the way out here,

311
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,580
so please take this with you too!

312
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,680
Here.

313
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,380
Thank you so much.

314
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,580
Amazing.

315
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,280
Her love strategy is really working out well.

316
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
By the way, Sonoko,

317
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,880
I wonder about that animal pattern outfit that you're wearing.

318
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,580
Really?

319
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm happy for you, Sonoko.

320
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,180
The police arrived after day break.

321
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
The horror of the snowy mountain passed over

322
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,580
together with the blizzard.

323
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,380
Then, February 14th finally comes.

324
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,280
Hey, why didn't you write anything on your chocolate?

325
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,180
I was going to write something later secretly.

326
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm going to the airport to see Makoto off then, okay?

327
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,280
Good luck!

328
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,780
Bye!

329
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,080
Sonoko.

330
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,980
I can't write anything on it.

331
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,080
Your feelings don't reach the one you want to give the chocolate

332
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,180
if you give it after Valentine's Day.

333
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,780
I can't make myself write the name of someone

334
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,080
who don't even know the whereabouts of.

335
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm home.

336
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,380
Maybe I should give this chocolate to dad.

337
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,880
Ran, you sure are strong.

338
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,980
I really wish I were all that strong.

339
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,680
Don't cry, you fool.

340
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
Don't cry.

341
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,880
Huh? I wonder who put the coat over me.

342
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,580
Oh, it's snowing!

343
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,080
Oh, no! It's this time of night already!

344
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,080
I better hurry and get dinner ready.

345
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,880
I got a mail.

346
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
There's an image attached to it?

347
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,680
Huh?

348
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,380
Hey, what's this?

349
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,580
Isn't that me?

350
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,780
"I got a shot of you sleeping, Detective Kid".

351
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,380
Oh, yes!

352
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,480
Good evening, this is Detective Kid.

353
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,380
Shinichi?

354
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Shinichi, you're here?

355
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,380
Yes, until just a while ago.

356
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,280
If you had time to do a stupid thing like this,

357
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,680
you should've woke me up!

358
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,780
I'm sorry. But you were fast asleep while drooling, so...

359
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,980
Drooling?

360
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,680
Oh, right. While I was waiting for you to get up,

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,480
I got hungry.

362
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,380
So I ate the chocolate that was on the desk.

363
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,680
What?

364
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Well, talk about rare,

365
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,380
I mean a peach shaped chocolate.

366
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,780
Peach shaped?

367
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,280
Well, it didn't taste like peach, but it sure was good.

368
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
Really?

369
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Yes, it was the best I've eaten so far.

370
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,080
Where'd you buy that chocolate?

371
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,680
No! I can't tell you.

372
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,980
It's a great store that only I know of.

373
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,480
But, Shinichi,

374
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,880
calling yourself "Detective Kid" is kind of dorky.

375
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,980
Yes, I thought so.

376
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,000
Next Conan's Hint:

377
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,940
"Wristwatch"
