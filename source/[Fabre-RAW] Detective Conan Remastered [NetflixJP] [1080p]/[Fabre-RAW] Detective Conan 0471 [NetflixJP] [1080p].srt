1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,270
Speed!

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,370
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,070
Our car with three of us inside was rigged in a way that

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,770
it would explode if the speed is reduced!

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,170
What're you going to do, Pops?

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,370
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,969
"Chasing rabbits in the mountains"

10
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,869
"of my homeland."

11
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,869
"Fishing on a small boat"

12
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,069
"in the river of my homeland."

13
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,069
Ran. How much more is there to go

14
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,469
before we reach the hot spring we're headed for?

15
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,369
Just about 100 km more.

16
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:26,069
We've only driven 10 km so far.

17
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,969
Dad! You've been asking the same question every five minutes.

18
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,669
I don't mind you being super happy.

19
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:33,169
But please watch out not to speed so much.

20
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,169
I know. Today sure is a nice day.

21
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,369
Bathing in a hot spring.

22
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,469
Delicious food, good liquor.

23
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:46,669
Moreover, we get to enjoy all of it at half price!

24
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,469
I'd like to speak to Inspector Megure

25
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:59,769
of MPD First Investigation Division.

26
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,369
Dad...

27
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:05,869
-Ran, will you answer it. -Okay.

28
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:06,969
Who is it from?

29
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,469
Let's see. Inspector Megure?

30
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,469
Inspector Megure?

31
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,769
-Hello. -Mouri! Where are you now?

32
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,269
In Takaoka-cho.

33
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,469
This is Ran.

34
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,769
I'm in the car together with Conan and dad.

35
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,169
Ran? Takaoka-cho?

36
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,469
Their present location is Takaoka-cho!

37
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,569
What does the Inspector want?

38
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,869
Well...

39
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:31,269
Listen, Ran.

40
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,469
Yes.

41
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,569
Stay calm and listen.

42
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:37,369
The car that you're riding in now is...

43
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,669
An explosive device is rigged onto it!

44
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,869
An explosive device?

45
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:45,869
What?

46
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,569
Ran!

47
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,069
If the car that you're in now go further than 10 km,

48
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,269
the switch of the explosive device will turn on.

49
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,269
Ten km?

50
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,769
Then the switch has already...

51
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:07,869
The car...

52
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:10,269
Don't stop the car!

53
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,669
Keep going the way you are!

54
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,169
Once the car reduces speed to below 20 km/h...

55
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,869
it'll explode!

56
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:21,369
It seems that a device that works that way is rigged to the car.

57
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:29,569
"Rental Car Goes Out of Control"

58
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:39,069
But, Inspector, maybe someone's just playing a prank.

59
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,869
The culprit says that he will first blow up the water tower.

60
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:51,769
So as long as we haven't confirm whether or not this warning is true,

61
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,269
it's better to think that a real explosive device is attached.

62
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,369
An explosive device.

63
00:04:58,369 --> 00:04:59,869
A bomb.

64
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,369
A time bomb is rigged so that when Pops goes by, it will explode.

65
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,569
This is a demonstration to show.

66
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:11,869
That was done to prove this wasn't a lie.

67
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,769
It's a demonstration

68
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,569
from the culprit who set the bomb to this car.

69
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:29,969
Mouri?

70
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,669
Mouri!

71
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:33,969
Don't worry.

72
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:35,569
Just stay calm and drive on.

73
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,369
I've deployed an emergency squad just now.

74
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,569
We're counting on you.

75
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,469
We'll catch up with you soon too.

76
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,469
And Inspector, about the culprit...

77
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:14,169
All right, I'll tell you now.

78
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,569
Just a while ago, I got a call from a man who called himself Sugiyama.

79
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,469
It's most probably an alias, though.

80
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,969
He said that he rigged an explosive device

81
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,069
to the car that Kogoro Mouri rented.

82
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,069
Do you have any idea who this Sugiyama could be?

83
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,269
Sugiyama.

84
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:37,869
The name of the worker at the rental car company was called Sugiyama.

85
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:40,969
That man introduced

86
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,269
this half price discount hot spring campaign we're headed for today.

87
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,169
But why me?

88
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,369
He says that if he kills you, a famed detective,

89
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:52,069
he would be famous as well.

90
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:53,969
I thought it may be a prank.

91
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,269
But he's aware of your moves.

92
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,269
And he did blow up the water tower.

93
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,969
So, we've no choice but to subject to his orders.

94
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,469
Orders?

95
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:04,869
Sugiyama is saying

96
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:07,369
he wants you to take the expressway.

97
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,769
Expressway? What's his purpose?

98
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,069
I don't know.

99
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,469
Until we get a hold of the situation,

100
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,969
please do as he says.

101
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:15,569
All right.

102
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,269
The culprit disclosed his name

103
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:20,569
and ordered the car to take the expressway.

104
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,269
Could there be a reason for the culprit having chosen today too, then?

105
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,669
Report on the circumstances on the road block

106
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,469
near the Takaoka ramp of the expressway.

107
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,669
The east intersection of the expressway toward Takaoka is now closed.

108
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,869
Likewise, roads leading to Takaoka-cho have been blocked.

109
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,869
Route eight leading to the Takaoka ramp has been blocked

110
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,369
and a detour has already been secured.

111
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,369
All the sidewalks near the respective roads have been blocked off.

112
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,669
Confirmation of all roads that have been blocked is completed.

113
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,069
The detour to the expressway has also been set.

114
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,269
Roger.

115
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:10,469
Mouri! We have visibly confirmed your car.

116
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,169
Starting now a speed cop on a white motorbike will lead your car along.

117
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,569
Got it!

118
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,469
Ran, Conan.

119
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,669
The Inspector come to help us.

120
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,869
The police will handle this matter for us.

121
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,169
So don't worry.

122
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,869
Okay.

123
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:37,669
Kogoro Mouri. Writhe in agony!

124
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,369
I'll watch you suffer for a while, then kill you.

125
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,369
You gotta be kidding!

126
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,169
What's up, dad?

127
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,769
Gas.

128
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,369
We only have less than half left!

129
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,969
I'm sure it was on full when we rented this car.

130
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,169
Darn it!

131
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,369
He made us confirm the tank once

132
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,469
and after we checked, he drained the gas out just before we left.

133
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:07,769
Don't worry! I'll get you two out of this car

134
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,369
before we run out of gas.

135
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:13,069
Mouri, let's get the two out of the car first.

136
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,369
Open the window, please.

137
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:16,969
It won't open!

138
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:20,469
The door won't open either!

139
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,469
Ran, what about that side?

140
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:23,969
This side is no good either.

141
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,869
Darn it! He broke it beforehand.

142
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:35,069
The gas is less than half.

143
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,369
If we go at 20 km/h which is the minimum speed,

144
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,369
we've got to maintain we may at most keep for an hour.

145
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,869
Once we run out of gas, the car will stop and explode.

146
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,569
The windows and doors cannot be opened from inside.

147
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,669
What now?

148
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:51,969
This is Megure.

149
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,869
Officer Takagi, where are you now?

150
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,469
I'm approaching the merge!

151
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:59,069
Inspector Megure, sorry to keep you waiting!

152
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,869
I'm counting on you, Takagi.

153
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,069
Good! Keep this position!

154
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,169
Roger!

155
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,069
I'm counting on you.

156
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,269
Takagi.

157
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,769
Conan. Let's back off from the window.

158
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,369
Even if the glass is successfully cracked

159
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,569
and Ran and I get to evacuate from the car.

160
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,869
What about Pops?

161
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,369
If he takes his foot off the accelerator when escaping,

162
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:43,969
the car will reduce speed.

163
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,569
What should I do?

164
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,669
While maintaining the speed at over 20 km/h,

165
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,069
will anything work?

166
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,269
The position of the tires!

167
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,569
The position of the tires are falling out of line!

168
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:02,169
Back the car off a bit!

169
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,169
Okay!

170
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:06,869
Tires...

171
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,169
Spin.

172
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,069
Tires!

173
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,469
Stop without stopping.

174
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,369
That's it!

175
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,369
Yes, we've got to do it. In order to do it...

176
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,369
Ran! Conan!

177
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,869
Officer Takagi, hurry and help us! I'm scared!

178
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,469
Hold on, Conan.

179
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:33,769
Okay!

180
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:36,269
I'll pull you out right now!

181
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,269
Darn it!

182
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,469
Conan!

183
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:53,269
Are you all right, Conan?

184
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:55,469
Okay, once more!

185
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:58,069
-It'll be okay. Stay calm. -Okay.

186
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,969
They rescued one person.

187
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,669
Well...

188
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:15,169
Only 10 minutes before the car runs out of gas.

189
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,669
That's the time Mouri dies.

190
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,169
We've safely secured Conan!

191
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:23,969
Next, we'll work on getting Ran out!

192
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:26,069
Oh, no! Inspector Megure!

193
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:29,869
Bad news! The car is approaching a jammed area several km away.

194
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:34,169
A space enough to let one car through has been secured

195
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,869
but going pass while moving is impossible.

196
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,969
We may have to drop rescuing while the car is moving!

197
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,469
Please stop the rescue procedure!

198
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,669
Ran! Hurry!

199
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,669
-Ran! -Quick!

200
00:12:58,469 --> 00:12:59,769
Ran!

201
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,469
No good, can't do!

202
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:03,869
No good!

203
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,669
Takagi, get way! Hurry!

204
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,869
Ran.

205
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,569
Mouri.

206
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,869
Inspector!

207
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,269
Pops said...

208
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:47,641
Ran.

209
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:51,341
Cover your head with my jacket.

210
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,941
And after you jump out, get down right away.

211
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:57,341
You may get hurt but it's better than losing your life.

212
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,241
You can do it.

213
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,941
But what about you, dad?

214
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,241
First priority is for you to be saved.

215
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:06,841
Listen to me, I'm your parent.

216
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,041
Mouri?

217
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,841
Can you hear me, Mouri?

218
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,741
Just a while more.

219
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,341
Just a little while more, big brother!

220
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:25,441
Ichiro Matsumiya?

221
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,641
Yes.

222
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:29,341
The case that you and I were after.

223
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,641
The culprit who killed his girlfriend who fell out of love with him.

224
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,441
He was being pursued by us

225
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,441
and sped his motorbike along the expressway.

226
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:40,441
He crashed into a fence at the turn off and died

227
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:42,141
three years ago today.

228
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,041
But, didn't he commit suicide?

229
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,841
Matsumiya had a younger brother that was staying in the U.S.

230
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,341
as a student back then.

231
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:52,941
If he thinks that we were responsible

232
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:54,841
for his older brother's death

233
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:57,641
without knowing of all that happened then...

234
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:01,141
No. He has a grudge against us because of a misunderstanding?

235
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:04,741
We're looking for the whereabouts of Matsumiya's younger brother now.

236
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,041
We'll take custody of him soon.

237
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,441
And...

238
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,241
how's the gas tank?

239
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:14,041
It's practically on empty.

240
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,241
I wonder how much longer it's going to hold up.

241
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,241
Ran.

242
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,441
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,741
I got you messed up in this because of me.

244
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,741
You can do it.

245
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,341
Hurry up and go!

246
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,841
Dad.

247
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,341
Stupid! Get out of my way!

248
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,941
Don't come near me!

249
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,941
Kogoro Mouri.

250
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:55,141
The time for us to part is about to come.

251
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:58,241
That tunnel will be your grave!

252
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,741
I did it...

253
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:55,241
I killed Kogoro Mouri.

254
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:56,941
I avenged my brother's death.

255
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,241
Big brother!

256
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:07,641
Where are you going?

257
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:12,241
I'm Megure from the Metropolitan Police Department.

258
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,841
You're Mr. Jiro Matsumiya?

259
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:22,341
I checked the cases having to do with the expressway

260
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,841
three years ago today that involved Kogoro Mouri

261
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:29,741
and found the case involving your older brother, Mr. Ichiro Matsumiya.

262
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,041
And thus, found you, Mr. Jiro Matusmiya.

263
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,041
That's how we got to you.

264
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,741
So, what?

265
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:40,941
There is suspicion that the Public Roads Administration's security

266
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:44,041
was hacked by the computer at your residence today.

267
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,641
We'd like to ask you questions on it.

268
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,641
So please come with us to the station.

269
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,541
What's the matter?

270
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,741
Mr. Sugiyama...

271
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,041
No, Mr. Matsumiya.

272
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,941
You look like you've seen a ghost or something.

273
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,341
Why?

274
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,541
Why are...

275
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,241
why are you alive?

276
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:11,341
I'm alive and kicking as you can see.

277
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,341
It was set to explode when the car stopped.

278
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:18,841
The car's still running while gas is being pumped into it.

279
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:19,841
It's only a matter of time

280
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:22,141
until the bomb disposal squad removes the explosive device.

281
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,241
How?

282
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,141
The device is on the back of the body of the car!

283
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:28,141
There's no way it can be removed!

284
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,641
The car isn't stopped but still running.

285
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:48,541
They're working to remove the explosive device right now.

286
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,841
The speed is being maintained at 20 km/h.

287
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,341
When on earth...

288
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:58,741
What about that explosion?

289
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:02,541
Yeah. In that tunnel...

290
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,941
On the bed of a large truck

291
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:15,641
and by the bomb disposal squad that was in the tunnel beforehand.

292
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:18,641
A slope was used, a net was hooked up.

293
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,341
All set!

294
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:29,041
The car that I drove was lead onto a large truck.

295
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,041
The car that is on the truck was stopped by the net

296
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,041
and the tires are still spinning on rollers.

297
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,241
Afterwards, the bomb disposal squad were able to move in and rescue Ran

298
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:48,341
and keep supplying gas to the car.

299
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:51,341
They opened the door on my side

300
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:53,641
and fixed the accelerator in place.

301
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:03,441
Like so, the car is stopped but the tires are still spinning.

302
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:07,041
Thus, the explosive device can be removed.

303
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,241
A smoke candle and fireworks were used...

304
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,641
Fire!

305
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,241
We rigged it so that it would look like the car exploded.

306
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:17,041
No way.

307
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,141
It can't be.

308
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,541
Darn it!

309
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,841
If you guys didn't chase my brother too far.

310
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,641
He didn't have to die.

311
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,441
Just what're you talking about?

312
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:31,441
Your brother committed suicide.

313
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:32,741
Wrong!

314
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:35,941
Brother was killed by all of you!

315
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:39,041
My older brother was not such a weak person that would commit suicide!

316
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,641
There were no brake traces at the scene

317
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,541
where your brother crashed.

318
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,341
Moreover, he took off his helmet and threw it down

319
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,641
just before crashing into the fence.

320
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,541
He was determined to die.

321
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,841
No.

322
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,141
Matsumiya.

323
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:56,141
It's your biased perception.

324
00:20:56,141 --> 00:21:00,441
Besides, do you think your dead brother is happy about what you did?

325
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,141
Shut up!

326
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:06,441
Matsumiya. Unlike your brother, you're a lucky guy.

327
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:09,241
Nobody's dead.

328
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:13,941
You're not a killer.

329
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,641
Mouri.

330
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:21,641
Well, lucky you found out the truth. I'm glad.

331
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,241
Mr. Mouri.

332
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:07,041
Well, it sure was a surprise.

333
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:11,241
That the driver of that huge truck was Officer Sato.

334
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,641
Yes, it was me!

335
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,241
There's nothing to be surprised of, is there?

336
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:22,041
After all, you're the one who gave us order of what to do through Conan.

337
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:26,441
What's the matter, dad?

338
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,741
We've got to hurry to the hot spring!

339
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,841
Why don't you go again some other day?

340
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:34,541
No, the half price discount sale is just for today!

341
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:39,641
Maybe that was just a made-up story to get us to ride the car.

342
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,141
No way!

343
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:44,841
Maybe only that part is true.

344
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:47,141
So, Inspector Megure.

345
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:49,541
Could you lend us a police car?

346
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,141
You idiot! Just what're you talking about?

347
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,841
Well, you know...

348
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:57,341
You've really got a great personality, Pops.

349
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:48,441
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,841
"Shinichi Kudo's younger brother"

351
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:52,141
The next episode will be about 10 years ago.

352
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,641
Which means you're not in it, right, Conan?

353
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,841
-But Shinichi was. -Right?
