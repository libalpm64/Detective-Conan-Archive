1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,740
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,240
A quiet village is in an uproar.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,140
Like the case, the bus is also out of control.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,090
Ran, Mr. Mouri and I are being rocked in a nostalgic bonnet bus

9
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,590
on our way to Kagekuwa Village to do some hiking.

10
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,090
But a murder takes place on the bus we're on.

11
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,090
The victim is Deputy Mayor Okumura who is the leader of the group

12
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,390
against using the bonnet bus to promote tourism

13
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,090
because it is a vital means of transportation for the villagers.

14
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,490
The police take Mr. Yabe, who is for promoting tourism,

15
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,290
into custody and things in the village begin to heat up.

16
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,390
To complicate matters,

17
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,690
a bus accident that happened seven years ago is involved in some way.

18
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,090
While that murder remains unsolved,

19
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,790
Mayor Funaki who is also for tourism promotion,

20
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,190
is attacked on the grounds of the shrine

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,190
and Ran is also in danger.

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,190
"The 10th Passenger (Part 2)"

23
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,990
-Ran! -Conan?

24
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,290
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

25
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,290
No, I'm fine, I just got run into someone.

26
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,690
Never mind me, I think there's somebody lying over there.

27
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,990
Mayor Funaki!

28
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,690
Stabbed once in the chest!

29
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,490
Death was almost instantaneous!

30
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,090
Ran, did you see the killer?

31
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,490
I don't know if it was the killer,

32
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,890
but I did see who rammed into.

33
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,290
Who is that person?

34
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,990
What does that person look like? Any outstanding features?

35
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,990
Well, actually...

36
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,290
It was Mr. Yabe, the head of the Youth Association.

37
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,790
What?

38
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,390
What? Mr. Yabe killed the mayor?

39
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,390
No, it's too early to tell...

40
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,490
Take me to his home!

41
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,790
"Patrolman Hitoshi Shinkai (28)" -I contacted the district station

42
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,290
and we'll have to wait until one of their investigators arrives.

43
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,690
Listen! Ran could have ended up like the mayor!

44
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,090
Now take me to his home right now!

45
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,690
Yes.

46
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,590
Yabe!

47
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,990
-Come out here! -Mr. Mouri! We don't have a warrant...

48
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,090
Darn it!

49
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,090
Yabe! Come on!

50
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,490
Darn! He got away!

51
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,490
The evening paper's still in the mail slot.

52
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,590
I don't think he came back here.

53
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,390
That means he called the mayor out

54
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,890
as soon as he was released and killed him!

55
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,790
And now he's on the run.

56
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,690
He planned this.

57
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,690
Mr. Mouri!

58
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,690
Listen! Have road blocks set up!

59
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,890
Yes, sir!

60
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,990
A bank passbook.

61
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,290
There's 200,000 yen being deposited every month starting two years ago.

62
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,290
But why is he using a bank

63
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,890
that is not even in the village.

64
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,390
I wonder if this money's...

65
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,390
The next day, the search for Mr. Yabe

66
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,590
was about to start.

67
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,090
"Shohei Hino (41), Detective" -Well, it looks like we're after prey.

68
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,490
Mr. Private Detective.

69
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,590
I don't want to work with you

70
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,190
but we can't let a dangerous man like him remain on the loose

71
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,690
so I'll join in the hunt.

72
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,290
The villagers are also joining the search

73
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,090
but the tension between the two factions was reaching its peak.

74
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,090
Did the killer count on the villagers to cause a commotion

75
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,090
or was he planning something else?

76
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,990
In the first place though, is the killer really Mr. Yabe?

77
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,590
If these murders were premeditated,

78
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,890
he'd have taken his passbook!

79
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,090
There are other things I don't understand.

80
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,490
The look of fear on the innkeeper's face when she dropped the food!

81
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,690
And the reason she was crying in front of the memorial tower.

82
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,090
And why was Ms. Toko watching her?

83
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,090
I'm pretty sure all of this has something to do

84
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,090
with the bus accident seven years ago!

85
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,090
Darn!

86
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,290
The one million yen the mayor promised to pay me is gone!

87
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,290
Yabe, you jerk! You won't get off!

88
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,190
Hello? Shinichi?

89
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,590
It seems you're involved in a big case there.

90
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,290
Yes, and I need you to look through some articles from seven years ago!

91
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,990
Sure, I can access the newspaper company's homepage for that information.

92
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,090
There he is! Over here!

93
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,790
Wait! You're not getting away!

94
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,090
Give my one million yen back!

95
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,690
Let's see. Seven years ago...

96
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,690
This is it!

97
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,890
"Bus Accident"

98
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,390
The bus falls off the cliff.

99
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,490
Two are killed. Eight people are injured.

100
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,690
Does it list the names of the deceased?

101
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,390
Yes, it's a local paper so they've listed all the names!

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,590
First, the ones with minor injuries...

103
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,390
I've got you, Yabe!

104
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,190
Don't fight it!

105
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,990
"Takuro Yabe (32)" -It wasn't me!

106
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,290
"Head of the Youth Association" -I didn't do anything!

107
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,590
You ran, that proves you're guilty!

108
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,590
Takuro Yabe, you're under arrest for suspicion of murder!

109
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,090
What did you say?

110
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,490
Deputy Mayor Okumura's name wasn't on it?

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,290
No, I don't see that name on the list.

112
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,490
Then, maybe Deputy Mayor Okumura...

113
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,790
Here're the names of the two men who were killed.

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,890
Yoichi Tezuka, 28 years old

115
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,590
and Kohei Moritsugu, 55 years old!

116
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,290
Dr. Agasa! I need you to locate

117
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,090
the relatives of those two men right away!

118
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,990
No! You're wrong!

119
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,890
When I got to the shrine, I heard the mayor scream

120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,390
so I ran over to see what happened,

121
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,890
that's when your daughter came!

122
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,290
I knew that if I stayed there everyone would think I did it,

123
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,890
I got scared and when I tried to get away,

124
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,990
I bumped into your daughter.

125
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,290
Don't lie! Then tell us why you went there in the first place!

126
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,790
The mayor called me and told me to meet him there.

127
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,690
He called you?

128
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,290
Why would he want to meet you at such an isolated place?

129
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,390
Well, it's...

130
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,990
Listen carefully, you don't tell us anything

131
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,390
and yet you want us to believe you,

132
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,690
don't you think that's asking a little too much?

133
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,090
What is this?

134
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,590
It's a bank passbook we found at your place.

135
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,390
200,000 yen is being deposited every month for the past two years!

136
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,990
And you're using not the post office savings or the Farmer's union,

137
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,090
you're using a bank that's not in this village.

138
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,290
Which means, it's money

139
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,090
you don't want anyone in the village to know about, right?

140
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,990
I was leaking information!

141
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,990
Information?

142
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,990
Were you a spy? For the opposition?

143
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,990
Yes, deputy mayor, the man who died in the bus

144
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,890
was the leader of the opposition, he was paying me

145
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,790
and I've been telling him what Mayor Funaki was planning and his schedule.

146
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,390
But why was it so important that Mr. Okumura went to so much trouble?

147
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,390
If there was a new project in the works,

148
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,990
then the village funds would be paid

149
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,390
to companies Mr. Funaki favoured and naturally,

150
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,890
the companies the deputy mayor and people in the opposing faction

151
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,390
were connected with would be excluded,

152
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,990
that's why they had to crush the plans for the project before it started.

153
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,290
The mayor found out about it

154
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,690
and told you to meet him at the shrine, is that right?

155
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,190
Yes.

156
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,390
It seems when I was being questioned the first time,

157
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,690
he went into my home and found the passbook.

158
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,790
That means you killed Mr. Okumura so that you wouldn't be caught

159
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,290
and then you killed Mr. Funaki because you were!

160
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,390
No, that's not it!

161
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,790
I didn't do it!

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,290
Ma'am, would you mind explaining things to me?

164
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,790
What if these murders that are supposed to look like it has to do

165
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,090
with the fight between the two opposing factions in the village,

166
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,890
is really connected to the bus accident seven years ago?

167
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,690
The bus accident seven years ago?

168
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,990
That's impossible!

169
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,790
If that's the case, then Mr. Yabe's innocent!

170
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,990
Because on that day seven years ago, he was on that bus!

171
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,690
And Ms. Komai, so were you!

172
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,090
What in the world happened?

173
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,090
What happened on that bus?

174
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,290
All clear.

"Mamoru Kajita (35), Bus Driver"

177
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,790
That's the truth behind that accident seven years ago.

178
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,290
I knew it!

179
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,090
That's why Mayor Funaki was so afraid the truth would come out,

180
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,290
he offered to pay Kogoro all that money, so he could control the situation!

181
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,490
Hello?

182
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,790
I've located the relatives of the two bus accident victims!

183
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,990
It was on a follow-up article!

184
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,790
What was that? That person's...

185
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,890
I understand! Thank you!

186
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,690
Ms. Komai! If I want to take the bus at the same time of the accident,

187
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,690
what time does it leave the station?

188
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,690
If it's that bus, it's left already.

189
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,890
Oh, no!

190
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,390
Ms. Komai, I'm counting on you!

191
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,390
You've got to catch up with that bus!

192
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,390
I don't want that person to kill any more people!

193
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,790
Please, let us make it in time!

194
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,890
This can't be happening!

195
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,490
The brakes don't work!

196
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,690
What?

197
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,790
Are you kidding me?

198
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,390
That's ridiculous! It's all downhill from here!

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,580
What? Mr. Yabe killed them?

200
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,580
Yes, he's going to be transferred to the main precinct this afternoon.

201
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,080
Does that mean your job is...

202
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
It's over.

203
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,880
Not only did I lose out on the money,

204
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,480
I had to work for no pay on top of that.

205
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Good grief, what a hiking trip this turned out to be!

206
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,580
Oh, my! I just realised, where did Conan go?

207
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
I see it! There it is!

208
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,180
Kajita, do something!

209
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Engine brake! I'm already doing that!

210
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,880
The wire's cut from the emergency brake!

211
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,280
The bus's brakes aren't working!

212
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,180
Ms. Komai, by this car alongside the bus!

213
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,280
What're you going to do?

214
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,980
I'm going to get on the bus!

215
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
Wait, kid!

216
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,580
It's too dangerous! Don't do it!

217
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,280
This is just like what happened seven years ago.

218
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,480
What?

219
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,980
That's right, even the passengers are the same.

220
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,680
That's impossible. This is just coincidence, isn't it?

221
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,280
No! This is no coincidence!

222
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,780
Conan! When did you get on?

223
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,880
A certain person told me the story!

224
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,580
Seven years ago, all of you were on this very bus!

225
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,880
Even Mayor Funaki who was killed

226
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,580
and Mr. Yabe who is suspected of killing him were on board,

227
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,580
a total of ten passengers!

228
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,180
You all remember what happened, don't you?

229
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Ms. Komai, the innkeeper of Komai Inn

230
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,380
was the bus guide then.

231
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,680
Come on!

232
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,880
"Yoichi Tezuka (28), Passenger" -Come and drink with us!

233
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,180
"Kinu Komai (35), Bus Guide" -Somebody help me!

234
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Don't be so unfriendly!

235
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,280
-Somebody stop him! Help! -Come on!

236
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,980
-Please help me! -You!

237
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,080
"Kohei Moritsugu (55), Passenger" -Stop that immediately!

238
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,980
She doesn't want to drink with you!

239
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,580
What'd you say?

240
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm just trying to have some fun,

241
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,380
don't interrupt!

242
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,080
The two people that died in that accident

243
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,780
were the man who was bothering Ms. Komai

244
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,980
and the man who tried to save her

245
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,180
and miraculously, the eight villagers survived.

246
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,480
In the end, you all kept your silence!

247
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,280
And you made it appear the accident was caused by the two men fighting!

248
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,480
You people caused the death of one brave man

249
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,280
and you hid your guilt deep in your hearts.

250
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,580
After everything I've said, you should have come to realise

251
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,880
the two murders were committed by a member of that brave man's family,

252
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,480
one of Mr. Moritsugu's children,

253
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,280
the motive is revenge!

254
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,680
Isn't that right, Ms. Toko?

255
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,980
Natsume is your mother's maiden name, isn't it?

256
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Your real name is Toko Moritsugu!

257
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,080
What? Ms. Toko is...

258
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,680
She is his daughter!

259
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,580
What did you say? The killer is on the bus?

260
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,980
And who is it?

261
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,980
I don't know! But the bus has no brakes

262
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,480
and it's out of control!

263
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,980
Hey! Call the main precinct!

264
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Yes, sir!

265
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,180
And that kid is also on the bus.

266
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,180
What? How did Conan get on the bus?

267
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,880
Ms. Toko wanted to know how her father died

268
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,380
so she moved here and began investigating,

269
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,680
then she found out the truth!

270
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,280
She probably heard it from Mr. Kajita

271
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,880
who worked with her and befriended her, right?

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,780
Ironically, one of the men she wanted to take revenge on,

273
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,080
Mr. Yabe was arrested because he and the victim

274
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,080
were on opposing factions in the village dispute.

275
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,380
Ms. Toko knew all of you would be on this bus today

276
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,380
going shopping and running errands,

277
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,480
she meddled with the brakes, so you'd all be killed!

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,580
At the same spot seven years ago!

279
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,380
"Memorial Tower"

280
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,180
Isn't that right, Ms. Toko?

281
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,380
I don't believe it.

282
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

283
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,380
It's no use to pretending.

284
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,680
Why are you so calm then?

285
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,280
Because you're about to commit suicide, aren't you?

286
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,380
You're going to die along with everyone else.

287
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,680
Good grief! What a bothersome child!

288
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,280
Get off of this bus, Conan!

289
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,780
The bus will slow down on the next curve,

290
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,280
if you're careful, you'll just get a few bruises!

291
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,980
So are you admitting I'm right? You're behind all of this!

292
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,580
Yes! I confess!

293
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,680
I killed both Deputy Mayor Okumura and Mayor Funaki!

294
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,680
When the bus was crowded,

295
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,880
I put the poison in the deputy mayor's drink!

296
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,280
I waited in the dark and stabbed the mayor on the shrine grounds!

297
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,880
That's right! I came here to get revenge

298
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
on the people who were on this bus seven years ago!

299
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,480
My father was a very righteous man!

300
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,180
He only did what was natural,

301
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,180
when he saw someone in trouble, he went to help!

302
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,180
But that day...

303
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,180
if even one of you had backed him up!

304
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,380
Hurry! Conan, you've got to jump now!

305
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,980
It's too late.

306
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
Even if you let me go,

307
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,980
it still won't change the fact that you killed the wrong person!

308
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,380
What?

309
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,880
Deputy Mayor Okumura, the first victim,

310
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,380
wasn't on this bus seven years ago!

311
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
What did you say? That can't be!

312
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,280
As the bus guide, you've seen him every day

313
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,580
so you know what he always says...

314
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,980
This has been my seat for 40 years!

315
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,680
When someone has continued to say that

316
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,580
and if you were to ask him about that incident seven years ago.

317
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,880
You did ask him about it, didn't you?

318
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,780
Of course, I asked him personally!

319
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,680
Seven years ago?

320
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,680
No mistake, I was sitting right here in my own seat!

321
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,980
He was very clear about it!

322
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,780
But Deputy Mayor Okumura had a cold and his fever was very high that day,

323
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
so he was in bed!

324
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,080
His name wasn't in the newspaper either!

325
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,980
You're lying. I read the newspaper myself.

326
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,380
He was probably so convincing,

327
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
you just thought you saw his name listed.

328
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,680
But, then... who was the 10th passenger?

329
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,580
That person died two years ago from an illness.

330
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,280
So you see, Deputy Mayor Okumura had nothing to do

331
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,680
with your father's death!

332
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
That... That can't be.

333
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,180
You forgave Ms. Komai, didn't you?

334
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,380
Yes, she...

335
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,180
I'm sorry...

336
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,680
When I saw her like that,

337
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,080
I just couldn't bring myself to kill her.

338
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,180
She's not the only one,

339
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,580
I believe all the people who were on that bus that day

340
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,380
have been carrying a heavy burden in their hearts.

341
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,180
Please forgive us, Toko!

342
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,480
We were cowards!

343
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,880
Please accept our apologies...

344
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,980
If we crash at the same place,

345
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,880
then maybe Toko's father will forgive us and rest in peace.

346
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,680
No! Conan has nothing to do with this!

347
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,980
Do something!

348
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,280
There's nothing I can do.

349
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,780
I may be able to make the next curve

350
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,880
but there's no way I can make the curve at the scene of the accident.

351
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Don't give up!

352
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,680
There's bound to be a way to stop this bus!

353
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,380
There's a ditch! Get your tires into the ditch!

354
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,980
It's no use! I can't keep the tires down!

355
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,180
That's it! The suspenders Dr. Agasa invented

356
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,880
they're stretchable and snap back to its original length!

357
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,180
"Elastic Suspenders"

358
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,180
Oh, no!

359
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,380
Darn it! Maybe it won't hold a 10-ton bus!

360
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,680
We've... stopped.

361
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Conan, who are you anyway?

362
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm just a busy body private detective!

363
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,980
Thank you, little private detective.

364
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
That's for making us worry!

365
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
It hurts!

366
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,180
The case is solved,

367
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,480
and the bonnet bus continues to run

368
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,380
carrying its passengers and the memories they keep inside.

369
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,280
Slowly, into the greenery!

370
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,260
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,240
"Lunch box"

372
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,220
The next episode is another original made for TV.

373
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,740
That means the culprit is also original.

374
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,320
Well... It is.
