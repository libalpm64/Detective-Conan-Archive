1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,240
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,640
No one knows what will happen to the couple nor the outcome of the crime.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,940
Words are not necessary for feelings are conveyed.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,590
While exploring a limestone cave,

9
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,090
I am shot by a gang of bank robbers.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,190
Ran's blood is used for my transfusion and it saved my life.

11
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,690
This makes me decide to tell Ran about everything.

12
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,190
But then Haibara points a gun at me.

13
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,890
Later at Teitan High School

14
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,590
on the day of their school festival,

15
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,090
during the play in the gymnasium,

16
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,190
a murder is committed right among the audience.

17
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,790
Haibara mixes up a potion that restores me to my old body,

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,090
and I solve the case immediately.

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,690
Thankfully Ran's suspicions are dispelled.

20
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,690
The next day I ask Ran to have dinner with me

21
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,690
at the roof top restaurant in the Beika Center Building.

22
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,490
But once again, we were caught up in another murder case.

23
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,390
I leave Ran waiting

24
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,490
as I go off to investigate.

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,790
I quickly deduce who the killer is.

26
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,990
I was right.

27
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,290
He killed Mr. Tatsumi after all.

28
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,290
It was Mr. Oba, no doubt about it!

29
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:16,490
"Perilous Return: Place Where Vows Are Made"

30
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,790
I wonder what it is.

31
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,590
What does Shinichi want to tell me?

32
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,090
What could it be?

33
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,490
A proposal, he's going to propose!

34
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,290
What?

35
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,790
I don't believe it, it can't be.

36
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,290
I mean, we're still in high school.

37
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,590
I wish Shinichi would hurry and come back.

38
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,690
I'm absolutely sure Mr. Oba shot Mr. Tatsumi,

39
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,890
but I have two unanswered questions.

40
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,590
I can't explain the strange actions Mr. Tatsumi took in the elevator,

41
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,190
and the lack of powder burns.

42
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,890
Seeing how confident he acted,

43
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,690
I'm sure he did something

44
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,390
so we wouldn't find any powder burns on him.

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,990
I know, maybe that's how he did it.

46
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,390
Mr. Oba was wearing an animal costume at the party, wasn't he?

47
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,890
Oh, that's right.

48
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,690
He could have changed his clothes!

49
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,690
Are you sure about that?

50
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,990
Yes.

51
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,290
Tonight's party was in part,

52
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,090
to celebrate the unveiling of our new company mascot,

53
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,190
and the character was on stage all night.

54
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,390
We were shocked when we found out Mr Oba was inside it!

55
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,990
We really were.

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,390
I see.

57
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,190
So if he had another set of the same outfit,

58
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,090
he could have switched it with the one

59
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,890
with the powder burns on them.

60
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,290
But he couldn't have.

61
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,490
Before he change into his costume,

62
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,290
Mr. Ooba handed us his jacket and slacks.

63
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,490
But...

64
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,290
He is suspicious, isn't he?

65
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,990
You shouldn't talk like that.

66
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,490
He worked really hard to make us laugh.

67
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,890
Are you talking about that character winking?

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,490
Sure, it was funny at first.

69
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,890
But that's the only thing he did.

70
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,790
So after a while, it got pretty stale.

71
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,390
Excuse me.

72
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,790
If you don't mind, may I take a look at that costume?

73
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,090
So, this is it.

74
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,590
The design's very surreal, isn't it?

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,790
Isn't it adorable?

76
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,290
Who was in charge of the party?

77
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,590
Mr. Ooba.

78
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,990
I've got it.

79
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,990
So that's how he did it.

80
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,590
So did you figure it out?

81
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,390
Yes, most of it.

82
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,490
Isn't it getting hot in here?

83
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,190
You must be kidding.

84
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,090
It's freezing, the cooler's on so high.

85
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,690
Huh? Then, why am I perspiring so much?

86
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,190
This can't be happening.

87
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,390
I don't believe it.

88
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,790
No, not now.

89
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,390
Not here...

90
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,390
Not on this important day.

91
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,190
Darn it.

92
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,790
Hey, are you all right?

93
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,890
Kudo?

94
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,290
Inspector Megure.

95
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,290
We found no traces of powder on Mr. Ooba.

96
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,590
I see.

97
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,290
Then, was it a hold up after all?

98
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,290
All right, then.

99
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,390
Let's ask around if anyone suspicious was seen going in

100
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,590
or out this building while the party was in progress.

101
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,990
-Yes, sir. -Wait.

102
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,490
There's no need for that.

103
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,090
The killer is already among us.

104
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,690
So, shall we step up to the stage, where the truth awaits us?

105
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,490
Hey! What's the meaning of this?

106
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,590
You already checked me out.

107
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,990
They didn't find anything!

108
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,490
So, why're you treating me Iike I'm the killer?

109
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,890
Now, just calm down.

110
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,890
You tell them that I couldn't have done it.

111
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,790
Yes, I'll swear to it.

112
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,890
Mr. Ooba was with me the whole time!

113
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,790
Naturally, I wasn't with him when he changed into his costume,

114
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,790
but the dressing room was locked.

115
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,690
Besides, there were other people with him,

116
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,590
so he couldn't have slipped out

117
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,690
or switched places with someone else.

118
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,690
Or are you implying that I'm lying?

119
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,290
No, we don't suspect you of anything.

120
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,690
You believe you were with Mr. Ooba through it all.

121
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,690
Even while the murder was taking place.

122
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,390
Wait a second.

123
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,490
Are you saying I helped a him kill my father?

124
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,990
No, I'm saying that the murder took place near you.

125
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,690
It's just that you didn't notice it.

126
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,790
Because at the time it happened, you had your eyes closed

127
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,990
and your back was facing the elevator

128
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,490
because you were kissing Mr. Ooba.

129
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,590
They were kissing?

130
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,090
Kissing? You mean...

131
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,390
That's right.

132
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,890
He cradled your head in his left arm like this,

133
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,390
covering your ears

134
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,190
and while he was kissing you,

135
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,190
he pushed the elevator call button.

136
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,890
And as soon as the door opened,

137
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,590
your father was shot

138
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,790
by Mr. Ooba.

139
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,490
But even if he covered her ears

140
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,090
and used a silencer on the gun,

141
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,590
wouldn't she have heard something

142
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,190
when the body fell to the ground?

143
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,490
Yes, believe she would have heard a faint sound.

144
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,590
That's why Mr. Ooba had the poppers go off just before the party.

145
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,690
When he moved his arm away from her ears,

146
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,090
just as the loud party poppers were going off,

147
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,590
the poppers would have made her forget

148
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,990
about the faint sound she had heard previously.

149
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,490
Of course, he would have made sure the elevator door closed

150
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,790
before he lowered his arm.

151
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,890
That's a very interesting story.

152
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,790
But there's one big hole in your theory.

153
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,190
Mr. Tatsumi left because he wasn't feeling well,

154
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,490
so he got into the elevator going down.

155
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,590
So, why was he still inside?

156
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,990
You aren't saying that

157
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,690
he was waiting inside for me to kill him, are you?

158
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,890
That's exactly what happened.

159
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,590
He never left, he was waiting inside all the time.

160
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,690
Waiting for you to come while wearing your costume.

161
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,490
You probably told him

162
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,590
to pretend you've gone home and change in here,

163
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,990
then you can return to the party and surprise everyone.

164
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,690
Isn't that right?

165
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,190
So what you're saying is,

166
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,890
the victim's clothes were scattered because...

167
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,790
Yes, he was getting ready to change.

168
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,190
Now, I understand.

169
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,390
The elevator's bell won't ring when the elevator is on hold.

170
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,790
On top of that, this is the company's private elevator.

171
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,890
Mr. Ooba planned this knowing no one would use it

172
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,690
until the party ended.

173
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,590
What about the powder burns?

174
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,890
If I was the killer, you would have found traces of it on me.

175
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,390
I understand that you winked.

176
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,790
I beg your pardon?

177
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,090
One of the girls told us

178
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,090
that while you were in the costume, you kept winking.

179
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,390
That made a light go off in my head.

180
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,890
You weren't winking to make them laugh.

181
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,890
You hid something inside the eye.

182
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,090
That's why it wasn't working properly, isn't that so?

183
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,890
You already wore gloves on your right hand

184
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,090
and you put a plastic bag over the gun,

185
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,690
closing it with rubber bands.

186
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,590
Then you put it in the inside pocket of your jacket,

187
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,290
making it portable

188
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,390
and when the gun is fired,

189
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,790
the powder wouldn't get onto your clothes

190
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,090
and the empty casings wouldn't fall on the floor.

191
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,690
But she was close to him,

192
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,890
wouldn't she have noticed him taking the gun out?

193
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,790
Of course, it would have been obvious if things were like it is now.

194
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,490
Please turn off the lights.

195
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,690
If the lights were dim like this,

196
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,890
the risk becomes far less.

197
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,390
And if he gives her a necklace while they were here,

198
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,290
she'll lead him to the restroom where she'll put the it on,

199
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,190
then he can toss the gun down the dust chute near the restroom

200
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,490
without leaving her side.

201
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,490
When Mr. Ooba covered her ears and touched her earring,

202
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,990
his left hand wasn't gloved.

203
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,290
That means we should find some very nice prints

204
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,790
from your fingers on this plastic bag.

205
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,590
My fingerprints on the plastic bag?

206
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,390
Of course, they would be.

207
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,090
I touched that plastic bag too, you know.

208
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,090
Along with the other people who helped me out of the costume.

209
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,190
What?

210
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,090
What does that mean?

211
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,490
-Isn't that right, guys? -He's right.

212
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,590
One of eyes wouldn't close,

213
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,190
so I opened it up and that bag was inside.

214
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,490
Mr. Ooba said it might be some important part of the costume,

215
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,890
so we should leave it inside.

216
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,390
This is my theory.

217
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,790
Someone who held a grudge against me

218
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,190
went down to the next floor and shot Mr. Tatsumi

219
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,690
while Ms. Sakurako and I were at the restroom.

220
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,390
And then to frame me for it,

221
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,090
the killer put that inside the costume.

222
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,690
It would have been easy

223
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,690
since the costume was in the dressing room until I put it on.

224
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,590
I think my theory sounds more realistic than your accusation

225
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,890
that I shot him while engaged in a kiss is absolutely silly.

226
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,590
Hey, Kudo...

227
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,890
So, fresh out of school detective, what's next?

228
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,890
You don't seem so cocky now.

229
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,290
What's the matter, run out of ideas?

230
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,390
Well, it doesn't matter. Because for every one of your questions,

231
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,490
I have a reasonable answer.

232
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,080
So, fresh out of school detective, what's next?

233
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
You don't seem so cocky now.

234
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,180
What's the matter, run out of ideas?

235
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,480
Pink pearl.

236
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,080
Mr. Ooba, when you gave her the necklace,

237
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,980
you said this to her, didn't you?

238
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
"It's a pink pearl necklace

239
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,580
matching with the earrings you're wearing tonight."

240
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,680
Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?

241
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,980
How did you know that?

242
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,880
How did you know she had pink pearl earrings on?

243
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,680
You're really grasping for straws, aren't you?

244
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,580
Well, it's obvious that...

245
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,480
She told me

246
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,880
that she bought those tonight on the spur of the moment

247
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,480
just before meeting you here tonight.

248
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,980
Which means, you couldn't have seen them until you saw her here.

249
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,280
And in this spot with the lights down so low,

250
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,680
those pink pearls look like mere dark balls.

251
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,880
There's no way you could tell that it was pink.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,980
That's right. Not unless...

253
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,580
you opened this door of light

254
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,580
while you were kissing her.

255
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,580
Mr. Ooba, you couldn't have...

256
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,280
Mr. Ooba, why don't you answer me?

257
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,680
Tell us why you opened the door.

258
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
You're asking me why?

259
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,580
The answer is simple.

260
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,380
Because I made a promise to my father.

261
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,780
That I would avenge his death.

262
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,780
Avenge your father's death?

263
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:42,480
Yes. My father also had a rather big game company.

264
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,980
That was until 20 years ago

265
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,480
when her father suggested their companies merge.

266
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
He suggested they open an office in the Beika Center Building.

267
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,680
But he wasn't planning a merger, he was planning a take over.

268
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,580
All the game creating know-how my father constructed was stolen

269
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,580
and all the employees in my father's company were laid off.

270
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,280
And my father...

271
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,480
who was vice president in name only,

272
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,980
was so full of despair, so he killed himself.

273
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,880
But papa took such good care of you.

274
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,180
Yes. I think it was because he felt guilty.

275
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,180
That's why he kept promoting me.

276
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,880
Me, the man who planned to kill him,

277
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,280
marry his daughter and take over the company.

278
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,380
No way...

279
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,480
It was all a game.

280
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,880
The story line was the hero uses the powers of evil

281
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,480
to overthrow the demon.

282
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
But who would have thought it would end the same way.

283
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,680
What do you mean by that?

284
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,580
My father was murdered, but it was made to look like a suicide.

285
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,880
He was killed 20 years ago,

286
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,180
right here in this very building by Mr. Tatsumi.

287
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,180
But someone saw through the crime.

288
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,780
It was a young man like you,

289
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,480
he figured it out just like you did tonight.

290
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,780
I guess when you borrow the powers of evil,

291
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,180
you have to pay the price.

292
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,680
Yes, that's it! I remember it now!

293
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
It was Yusaku!

294
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,180
Yusaku Kudo butted in when we were investigating the case

295
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,780
and he solved it for us!

296
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,580
Oh, you're talking about that mystery writer.

297
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,580
Which means the son solved the crime which arose

298
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,480
from the crime committed 20 years ago which the father solved.

299
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Isn't that ironic? Don't you think, Kudo?

300
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
Kudo?

301
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,280
Please. I need a little more time.

302
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,180
She... she's waiting for me.

303
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,580
I can't turn into Conan again now.

304
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,080
Haibara?

305
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,880
You...

306
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,380
why...

307
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,180
24 minutes over time.

308
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,980
I guess that's the maximum tolerance level.

309
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,780
I'll consider this a loan.

310
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,980
Edogawa.

311
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,880
Hey, did you hear? The murder's been solved.

312
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,380
Is that true?

313
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,680
You're finally going to get to see him, aren't you?

314
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,180
I mean, your boyfriend.

315
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,880
For goodness sakes. He is not my boyfriend.

316
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,980
Conan?

317
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,380
Here, take this card.

318
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Shinichi told me to give it to you.

319
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,380
Uncle Kogoro told me to come check up on you,

320
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,280
and I ran into Shinichi.

321
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,880
Is dad here, too?

322
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Yes. He's waiting in the parking lot downstairs.

323
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,780
Gosh, what's taking that kid so long?

324
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,080
It's already been one hour!

325
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,380
I can't wait anymore, I'm going to go have a look myself.

326
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,080
No, I better just wait.

327
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,580
That wouldn't be adult of me.

328
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,180
Darn it.

329
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,680
So, where is Shinichi?

330
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,880
Well...

331
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,480
It's like this, he got a call on his cellular,

332
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,680
it was about a case he worked on recently

333
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,580
saying something terrible happened

334
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,480
and so he ran off.

335
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,780
I see.

336
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,080
Shinichi is stupid, isn't he?

337
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,980
Leaving you all alone like this.

338
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,080
So, he left me behind again.

339
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,680
You know,

340
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,280
Shinichi told me that...

341
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
No! Stop it!

342
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,780
I don't want to hear it!

343
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,580
I don't want to hear it.

344
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,080
No more excuses from him.

345
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,080
Shinichi told me...

346
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,080
that one day...

347
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,480
One day, for sure...

348
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,480
He'll come back even if it kills him.

349
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,580
That's why...

350
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,180
That's why...

351
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,180
He wants you to wait for him. That's what he said.

352
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,480
That's why...

353
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,280
You're so silly.

354
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,180
Conan, you don't have to put on such a serious face.

355
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,080
It's all that eager beaver detective's fault,

356
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,680
he drops everything and runs off at the mere mention of a case.

357
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,880
Eager beaver detective?

358
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,580
Oh, I almost forgot! Conan, would you like some dessert?

359
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,780
Yes, sure.

360
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,580
Excuse me, dessert menu please.

361
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,180
Here you go.

362
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,780
Good grief.

363
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,880
He has some nerve, asking me to wait for him!

364
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,680
Who does he think I am, his mother?

365
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,480
That makes five desserts.

366
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,980
But I'd still like to know what he wanted to talk to me about.

367
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,480
Conan, aren't you curious too?

368
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Huh? No, not really.

369
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,980
Well, since he ran off without telling me,

370
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,480
I guess it wasn't very important.

371
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,780
I just don't understand

372
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,980
why he picked such an expensive restaurant

373
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,680
What a fool.

374
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,080
Making such a big deal when he had nothing important to say.

375
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
I don't know how to tell her.

376
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,680
I picked this place for good luck...

377
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,980
since dad proposed to mom here.

378
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,380
What's taking so long?

379
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,100
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,900
"Haru-yo-koi"
