1
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:04,969
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,269
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,269
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:09,769
Get to the truth of a case

5
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:11,769
that even a fortune teller cannot see through.

6
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:13,169
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,969
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,769
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,741 --> 00:02:00,541
"Shattered Horoscope".

10
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,441
The essential thing for a detective to do

11
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:11,241
is to grasp the case objectively.

12
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,541
And to be able to make logical deductions

13
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,841
without getting carried away by emotion, I guess.

14
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,119
Oh, does that mean you do not believe

15
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,641
"Reika Shijo (38)" -in things like astrology

16
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,541
"Astrologist" -that I work with, Mr. Mouri?

17
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,125
No, that's not what I mean.

18
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,541
Although it's a bit different from astrology,

19
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:33,541
the sixth sense and inspiration are needed to solve cases.

20
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:39,241
Inspiration to see through the truth of the cases intuitively that is!

21
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,241
Then, are there times that you think about fortune telling?

22
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:45,641
Well, I guess I do at times.

23
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,941
A whimsical publisher

24
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:53,741
has brought together the now famous astrologist, Reika Shijio

25
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,241
"Kensuke Katsuragi (45)" -and famous detective Kogoro Mouri,

26
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,941
"Starry Sky Weekly's President" -for a discussion,

27
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,541
so we all came to Reika Shijo's residence.

28
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,161
"Masao Tamura (32), Editor"

29
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:06,541
I guess I was born with the talent to be a detective

30
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,541
because at times, cases are solved without my being aware.

31
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,173
Oh, my. You've got to be kidding.

32
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:19,741
Ms. Reika, you have a call from Mr. Nakame of Tohto TV.

33
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,041
"Yuka Shiraishi (26), Reika's apperentice" -It seems to be an urgent call.

34
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,941
I'm in the middle of work now,

35
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,841
-later, okay? -Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:30,841
Okay, I'm going to start taking pictures!

37
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:36,195
Mr. Mouri, you don't have to make forced smiles.

38
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:39,041
What a lovely place.

39
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,541
It used to be the villa of a certain person of financial standing

40
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,241
but Reika bought it from him.

41
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,203
Reika?

42
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,941
I mean...

43
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,207
Ms. Reika.

44
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,541
Stained glass.

45
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:56,641
Yeah. Ms. Reika herself designed it and had it made.

46
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,941
You can find it in various places inside this mansion.

47
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:05,141
Her guardian star, Scorpio, is placed over her profile.

48
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:08,941
I'll go get the door.

49
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,341
Bitter!

50
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:14,741
This tea is too strong,

51
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,941
that there's practically no aroma to it!

52
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,541
I... I'm sorry.

53
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,239
I'll make another cup of tea right away!

54
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,841
You're...

55
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,941
"Clara Midorikawa (28), Actress" -Actress Clara Midorikawa!

56
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:33,741
I didn't know you had a guest.

57
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,255
This is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

58
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:38,941
This is something that a publisher planned and we're having a talk.

59
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,259
How do you do?

60
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,841
It's an honor to get to see you.

61
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,641
Ms. Reika, could I have a minute with you?

62
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,741
This is the last time, don't bug me anymore!

63
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,641
I've paid you more than enough, haven't I?

64
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,041
Are you sure that's what you want to say?

65
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,641
If I spill out what I know,

66
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,279
you're finished, you know.

67
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,341
But if things continue the way they are,

68
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,441
I've got no choice but to hang myself.

69
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,841
If you want to pull free of me,

70
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,641
go find someone else to take your place.

71
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,941
Someone else?

72
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:13,941
Yes, someone to take your place.

73
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,841
Anyone will do.

74
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:19,841
Anyone with money and troubled with scandals.

75
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:24,741
Introduce someone else and you can go free.

76
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,241
Who's this handsome guy?

77
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,841
What're you talking about?

78
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:38,317
Mr. Mouri, I will read your horoscope.

79
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,741
I think it will only take about an hour.

80
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,841
Please help yourself to some wine while you wait.

81
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,341
Clara, please come to my room at 5:00.

82
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:47,641
Okay.

83
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,941
Ms. Reika!

84
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,841
Oh, Ran.

85
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,351
Is there anything I can do for you?

86
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,941
I'd like you to give me a reading.

87
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,341
That's why I begged dad to bring me along.

88
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,441
It's something I'd really like to know about.

89
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:28,141
It's something that's really bothering you, isn't it?

90
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,341
Okay.

91
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:30,741
I'll give you a reading.

92
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:33,141
-Really? -Yes.

93
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,041
But I can't access the information now.

94
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:40,379
There are many others who are waiting to be read.

95
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,381
I see.

96
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,341
I'll give you this instead.

97
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,141
A lucky charm.

98
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,641
I can't accept something so expensive!

99
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,941
I'll let you keep it for me then,

100
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:55,341
until the day that I get to tell your fortune. Okay?

101
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,541
Yes!

102
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,741
I'll try to make time for you as soon as possible.

103
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,441
Thank you very much!

104
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,419
That can't be!

105
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:26,425
Didn't you promise to let me write this corner next time?

106
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,341
I was planning to let you too.

107
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,541
But Reika says no.

108
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,041
She wants to do

109
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,041
a fortune telling corner that is totally different from astrology.

110
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,841
It's not that you're not good or anything like that.

111
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,841
That's only a facade.

112
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,741
Ms. Reika doesn't like me!

113
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,441
Tres bien! (Excellent)

114
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,641
What's wrong, Yuka?

115
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:59,941
Were you scolded by Ms. Reika again?

116
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:06,741
I feel sorry for her because she's always being scolded by Ms. Reika.

117
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:10,469
Yuka is Ms. Reika's niece, but just because she's her niece,

118
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,041
Yuka is treated like a housemaid.

119
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,241
Well, I guess that's part of training too.

120
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,241
Excellent!

121
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,741
Yeah, it's me.

122
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:36,041
About that special...

123
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,497
Which way is the restroom?

124
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,141
Go left and straight ahead all the way down.

125
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,501
Thanks.

126
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,503
Left. Left.

127
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,141
I should've played soccer with Genta and the others

128
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:59,141
rather than come here.

129
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,641
It's a red-flanked blue-tail.

130
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,541
I wonder if they come all the way down here.

131
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,041
How rare.

132
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,541
Ms. Reika, dinner's ready.

133
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,041
Ms. Reika.

134
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:30,141
There's no answer no matter how many times I call.

135
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,241
Maybe she's asleep.

136
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:37,741
She's not the type to keep her customers waiting though.

137
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,041
Let's go see!

138
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,441
Mr. Mouri, will you please come with me?

139
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:43,741
Okay, if you want me to.

140
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,941
Ms. Reika! Ms. Reika!

141
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,841
Reika, is anything the matter?

142
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,571
The door's locked!

143
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,841
This is strange. Maybe there's something wrong.

144
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,441
Let's go check from the veranda.

145
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:58,577
Okay.

146
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,141
Reika! What's wrong? Reika!

147
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:14,941
No good!

148
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:17,641
Right, maybe we can crack the skylight.

149
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:19,441
I'll climb up there.

150
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,941
Will you hold the door for me, Mr. Tamura?

151
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:22,941
Yes, sir!

152
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,605
Please unlock the door as soon as you get inside!

153
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,241
Hold on, Reika.

154
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,941
Reika...

155
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,141
Please open your eyes, Reika!

156
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:02,241
The only way in and out of the room was locked.

157
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,041
The window is a non-opening window.

158
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,441
In other words, this is...

159
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,541
a locked door murder!

160
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:22,457
The victim is Ms. Reika Shijo, an astrologist.

161
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:26,957
It looks like she's been dead between three to three and a half hours.

162
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:28,157
The estimated time of the murder

163
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,669
is probably some time a little before or after 17:00.

164
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,957
You went in by cracking the skylight

165
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:36,675
because the door was locked?

166
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:39,457
And where was the key found?

167
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,457
It was on the floor around there.

168
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:45,157
Mr. Katsuragi picked it up and opened the door.

169
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,057
Do you have a spare key?

170
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:50,689
Yuka, her disciple may have the key.

171
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,057
A bird feather is on the floor.

172
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,257
The feather of a red-flanked blue-tail!

173
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:05,257
I saw it on the roof about 5:30!

174
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,257
If the feather back then fell from the cracked skylight,

175
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:11,557
isn't it strange that it's underneath the shattered glass?

176
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:13,157
Hey!

177
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:16,157
Don't go here and there on your own at the site of the murder!

178
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,457
Ms. Shiraishi.

179
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:20,719
Do you have the spare key to Reika's room?

180
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,957
No.

181
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:26,725
The key that Ms. Reika had was the only key to that room.

182
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,457
Yuka, being as near to her as you usually were,

183
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:34,733
wouldn't it have been quite easy for you to make a spare key?

184
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,957
Why would I?

185
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,457
Don't tell me

186
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,157
that you held a grudge against Ms. Reika

187
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,957
because she was against you writing a fortunetelling section in a magazine.

188
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,957
No way!

189
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,057
Now that Ms. Reika is passed on,

190
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:51,657
you'd be her only bereaved family, inheriting her entire estate.

191
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,157
I see.

192
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:56,157
The killer is you, Yuka!

193
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:57,157
What?

194
00:12:57,157 --> 00:13:00,457
You secretly made a spare key and...

195
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:03,157
Inspector, we got a verification as to the spare key.

196
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:07,057
-And? -Yes, sir.

197
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:10,257
This is a special type of key called dimple key

198
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:14,057
and only the manufacturer of this key is able to make a spare.

199
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:15,157
Moreover,

200
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:18,157
when you make a spare you've got to get credit card authorization too.

201
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:21,257
That's why it would be almost impossible for anybody but the victim

202
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:23,557
to make a spare key.

203
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:25,457
We confirmed with the manufacturer

204
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:27,457
that this is the one and only key to her room.

205
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,357
No... no way.

206
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:32,057
If so, this case is quite complicated.

207
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:36,457
Yes, since the only key there is was inside the room.

208
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:38,797
A locked room murder case.

209
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,757
Hold on! What if Mr. Katsuragi switched keys

210
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:45,857
from the one he had hidden to the real one when he unlocked the door?

211
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:47,657
What a thing to say.

212
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:50,809
No, I was watching him from beginning to end,

213
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,557
but he did no such thing.

214
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:55,657
Right. I was watching too.

215
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:56,815
Ms. Shiraishi.

216
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:00,557
When did you last see Reika?

217
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,357
When she left the living room

218
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:04,823
and headed to her workshop.

219
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,457
Where were you after that?

220
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:09,357
After talking to Mr. Katsuragi for two to three minutes,

221
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:11,157
I was in the kitchen right through.

222
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:17,257
I was in the kitchen all the while, helping her make dinner.

223
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,357
And you, Mr. Tamura?

224
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:21,457
The same as Yuka.

225
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:24,857
After that, I was with Mr. Mouri in the living room right through.

226
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,457
And you, Mr. Katsuragi?

227
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:27,957
The same with me.

228
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:31,257
I made a business call from the guest room,

229
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:35,557
and from after 17:00, I was here talking to Mr. Mouri and Mr. Tamura.

230
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,657
What about you, Ms. Midorikawa?

231
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:42,157
The... the same as everyone else.

232
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:45,557
Come to think of it, when I went to the restroom at about 5:00,

233
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:48,157
you came down from the second floor, didn't you?

234
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:52,457
That's because I had an appointment to have my fortune told at that time!

235
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,157
Don't tell me that you, Clara, killed Ms. Reika at that time.

236
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:57,157
Don't be ridiculous!

237
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:59,257
Why would I killed her?

238
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:00,879
Clara.

239
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,257
When I came here last month on business,

240
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:08,887
I saw you come out of Ms. Reika's room.

241
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,857
I'll kill that woman one day!

242
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:15,957
Kill her? Why on earth?

243
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,257
Reika is an ugly woman!

244
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:21,357
At first, she approaches you like she's a nice person,

245
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:24,257
then she pries into your privacy, saying that it's for fortunetelling.

246
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,257
After she gets hold of your weak points,

247
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:28,907
she turns into a devil

248
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:32,257
demanding a large sum of money for the reading!

249
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,913
I tried to break off all ties with her,

250
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,357
but she threatened to leak my private information to the media.

251
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:40,157
I see. She threatened you.

252
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:42,921
So, you were cornered into killing Reika.

253
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,457
No!

254
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,957
I went up to her room but...

255
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:51,257
I'm in the middle of work now. Later, okay?

256
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:55,957
That's why I came back without going inside!

257
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,857
Can you prove it?

258
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,957
Well, I don't know how...

259
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,947
Conan.

260
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,949
Ran.

261
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:13,657
I thought she was a kind person,

262
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:16,257
and I didn't think she'd threaten anyone.

263
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:19,357
I wanted her to give me a reading,

264
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,657
but she told me that she couldn't do so right away

265
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:22,961
and gave me this.

266
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,457
She told me it was a lucky charm.

267
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:27,257
She had it on the key holder that her key was on.

268
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:28,967
What's that?

269
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,957
She gave it to me before I went into her room

270
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,971
to ask her to give me a reading on dad.

271
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,557
That's...

272
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:40,057
"I'm in the middle of work now. Later, okay?"

273
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:42,257
The remark sure sounds familiar.

274
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:46,985
The skylight was made with the same thing as this.

275
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:54,993
This is...

276
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:00,357
I get it. That's the story!

277
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,857
At any rate, everyone,

278
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:03,001
I know it's troublesome,

279
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,003
but I would like you all to come to the station

280
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,657
and give us the details.

281
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:09,357
-Oh, no. -Okay.

282
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,357
The wine's getting to me only now.

283
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,457
Please wait, Inspector.

284
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,457
The only one you need to take to the station is the murderer.

285
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:26,457
What? Then, have you figured out who the murderer is?

286
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:27,657
Of course!

287
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,657
The locked room trick is not all that difficult.

288
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:35,033
The person who killed Reika

289
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:37,035
walked out of the room with the key

290
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,857
and locked the door.

291
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,857
He then, climbed the roof

292
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:45,043
and cracked part of the stained glass, opened a hole in it

293
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,857
and dropped the key inside from there.

294
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:55,053
The feather of the red-flanked blue-tail that Conan saw at around 5:30

295
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,457
dropped into the room from the hole that the killer made.

296
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:02,657
That's why it was underneath the shattered piece of glass.

297
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:03,957
As proof of that,

298
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:08,457
there are no shattered pieces of red pieces of glass.

299
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:09,557
That is,

300
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,357
there are no pieces of glass that are part of the Antares of Scorpio.

301
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,457
But why did the murderer

302
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:17,075
go as far as to commit a locked room murder?

303
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:20,057
In order to make a scapegoat of Yuka.

304
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:26,157
The murderer probably thought that Yuka had a spare key.

305
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:29,087
But since no such key existed,

306
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,657
it turned out to be a locked room murder case.

307
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,091
I see.

308
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:36,257
If so, then the murderer is Ms. Clara Midorikawa after all.

309
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:37,095
No!

310
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:38,757
No.

311
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:41,099
When Clara went to the room,

312
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,957
Reika was already killed.

313
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,103
What?

314
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,657
But I'm sure that I heard her voice!

315
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:48,857
Mr. Tamura.

316
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:52,557
You recorded me talking to Reika, didn't you?

317
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:53,557
Yes.

318
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:56,357
There was a phone call part way through the talk, wasn't there?

319
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:59,457
Could we listen to that part of the conversation?

320
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:00,757
Sure.

321
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,057
It seems to be an urgent call.

322
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,757
I'm in the middle of work now.

323
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:08,857
Later, okay?

324
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,257
Ms. Reika, it's me, Clara Midorikawa.

325
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,457
I'm working now.

326
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,157
Later, okay?

327
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:23,957
Which mean that the murderer is Mr. Tamura since he has a recorder.

328
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,143
No way!

329
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:30,157
Anybody can have a recorder hidden in his pocket.

330
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:32,657
Right, Mr. Katsuragi?

331
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:34,557
What the?

332
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:37,857
The one who killed Reika is...

333
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,257
you, Mr. Katsuragi!

334
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:45,657
Don't be ridiculous!

335
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:47,165
You mentioned a while ago

336
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:51,457
that maybe Yuka had the spare key to the room.

337
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,757
If so, why didn't you call her

338
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:57,175
when you found out you couldn't go into the room?

339
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:00,057
It... it just didn't dawn on me

340
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,357
because I was in a rush!

341
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:04,657
No. In order to hide the hole that you made

342
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,857
to drop the key into the room,

343
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:09,757
you needed to crack the skylight!

344
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:10,957
Wrong!

345
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:12,957
Then, let me ask you.

346
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:15,957
When you broke the skylight and landed in the room,

347
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:18,857
there were many keys on the floor.

348
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:23,201
But you without hesitation picked up the key to the room.

349
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,357
How did you know that it was the key to the room?

350
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,957
The key holder!

351
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,657
It's because I knew from before

352
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,857
that the key holder with the sapphires

353
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,257
was the one with the key to the room!

354
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,357
That's strange,

355
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:39,857
because that key holder that the key was attached to

356
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:42,957
was switched just before the murder was committed.

357
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:46,357
When my daughter asked Reika to read her fortune,

358
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:50,457
she gave my daughter her key holder as a lucky charm.

359
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,957
Isn't that right, Ran?

360
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:52,957
Yes.

361
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:02,057
The room key was attached to the Sapphire key holder

362
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:04,357
after Reika entered her workshop.

363
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:09,247
How can you, who haven't seen or talked to Reika after that,

364
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,249
have known about this?

365
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:16,257
The only person who can tell that the key on the sapphire key holder

366
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:17,557
is the one for room,

367
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:19,257
other than Reika,

368
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:23,261
is the murderer who used the key to carry out the locked room murder,

369
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,457
Mr. Katsuragi!

370
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,357
That woman's to blame.

371
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:37,275
She suddenly demanded me to pay her back all the money that she invested.

372
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,357
She told me that if I can't pay her back,

373
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:42,157
she was going to sell my story of getting insider information from a printer

374
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:45,057
and sell it to the magazines.

375
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:23,857
Ran.

376
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:25,657
What did you want her to read for you?

377
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:26,857
What?

378
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,657
Where Shinichi is right now?

379
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:35,057
I'm right here.

380
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:37,395
I wonder...

381
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,397
if he's really doing okay.

382
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,357
Rather than worry about Shinichi,

383
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:49,157
I think first priority is how we're going to

384
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:51,409
take Pops home, don't you think?

385
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:58,757
I wonder if there's anyone who reads snores?

386
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,844
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,423
"Wet jacket".

388
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,782
The playboy, Officer Takagi!

389
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:08,672
Wild racket?

390
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:10,580
Next on Detective Conan is "Wild Cheating Racket".
