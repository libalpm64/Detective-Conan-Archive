1
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:04,698
In order to appear as guests on a travel program

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:05,985
to be aired on Nichiuri TV,

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,698
we headed off to Hiroshima.

4
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,498
Strange things begin to happen

5
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:13,698
one after the other to the TV staff.

6
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,698
We get to know a woman, Yayoi

7
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:17,298
who works for a long established shop,

8
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:19,999
Misenya that is known for their special maple buns,

9
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,098
and find out about the legend of the 7 wonders

10
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,001
that is known in the Misen area,

11
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,098
and the connection it may have to the strange things that are happening.

12
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:26,897
Moreover, we find that

13
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:30,009
the suspicious man that had been asking around about the TV staff

14
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,498
seemed to be Yayoi's older brother, Shinroku.

15
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,015
Could there be any connection

16
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:38,017
between the accident that happened two years ago,

17
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:42,021
of the parents of Yayoi and her older brother falling to their deaths

18
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,898
from the Misen and the TV crew?

19
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,798
Moreover, the director Mr. Koshiji is attacked

20
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,698
and Misenya catches fire.

21
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,698
Was Shinroku responsible for all this?

22
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,998
Or...

23
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,798
Brooding over passing seasons

24
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:18,057
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

25
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,598
The seven mysteries are solved.

26
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,697
At the end of the trip, an unexpected culprit is caught.

27
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,398
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,398
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:27,298
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:57,142
"Hiroshima, Miyajima 7 Wonders Tour (Hiroshima Edition)"

31
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,342
"Kenichi Miyamoto (55)" -I am Inspector Miyamoto

32
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:04,642
from the Hiroshima Prefectural Police.

33
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,342
How is Mr. Koshiji?

34
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,642
How's his condition?

35
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:11,042
He's unconscious and in critical condition.

36
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,642
-Oh, no. -How terrible.

37
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,442
I'm sure that guy's the culprit!

38
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:18,642
Right, Mr. Detective?

39
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:20,942
No, no decisive conclusion yet.

40
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,042
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

41
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,942
I've heard of your great reputation many times.

42
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:26,185
Hello.

43
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,342
As to the culprit

44
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:31,042
are referring to Mr. Shinroku Ayase at Misenya here?

45
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,191
What?

46
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,242
Excuse me, but you're Mr. Ayase's younger sister?

47
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,842
Do you remember seeing this?

48
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,542
This is... My older brother's!

49
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,642
It seems to have been found

50
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,442
at the site where Mr. Koshiji was attacked.

51
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:44,842
Am I right, sonny?

52
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:46,842
Yep, that's right.

53
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:49,042
And, what was the cause of the fire?

54
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:52,211
Although it's not conclusive yet, the fire started

55
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,642
most likely by the boundary between the shop next door and here.

56
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:55,842
Since there was nothing to start the fire,

57
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,217
the possibility of arson is high.

58
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:02,221
Inspector!

59
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,542
When the fire broke out,

60
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,642
it seems that a person who resembles your older brother

61
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,542
was seen in the vicinity.

62
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,542
What?

63
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,042
Then, it's true...

64
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:15,042
That her older brother...

65
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,235
He attacked Mr. Koshiji,

66
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:17,742
and set fire to his own house?

67
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,942
No! It's a lie!

68
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:22,642
My older brother would do nothing like that!

69
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:24,243
Yayoi.

70
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,642
True.

71
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:27,942
If say, Shinroku were the culprit,

72
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:31,042
why would he set fire to his own house?

73
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,642
-What's up, sonny? -Huh?

74
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:35,342
Talking about fire...

75
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,942
could this be one of the 7 wonders,

76
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,842
inextinguishable fire, a symbol of it?

77
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,742
-True! -Another one of the seven wonders!

78
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,042
What's this about?

79
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,842
Well, I do think it's just a mere coincidence, but...

80
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,742
I see.

81
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:55,442
In other words, as to your parents' death,

82
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,342
at about the same time they got into an accident,

83
00:04:57,342 --> 00:05:02,281
your older brother had his doubts about the TV crew that were here,

84
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,242
so taking advantage of the seven wonders.

85
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,742
I'm just stating a possibility.

86
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,942
But...

87
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,842
I confirmed with Yayoi a while ago,

88
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:17,442
her parents got into the accident the day after we left.

89
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,297
Which means that

90
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:21,542
Mr. Koshiji has nothing to do with the accident of her parents.

91
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:25,042
However, Shinroku who didn't know about this, misunderstood and...

92
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:28,842
Either way, we, the police need to know

93
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:33,442
the whereabouts of Mr. Shinroku Ayase as soon as possible, too.

94
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:36,315
Where are you, Shinroku?

95
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:39,542
Although he's in hiding,

96
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:42,742
it can't be concluded that Shinroku is the culprit yet.

97
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,642
Somebody may be making it look that way,

98
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:49,442
so it could be that the culprit is among those people there too.

99
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:52,331
But, when Mr. Koshiji was attacked,

100
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,342
Mr. Hamada, Mr. Shimokura and Mr. Yatsukawa

101
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:58,342
were with us at the Ordination Platform.

102
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:00,642
Ms. Miyake was with Pops.

103
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:03,042
In the midst of the fire, Mr. Kitamura

104
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:06,345
called from his hotel, in Hiroshima.

105
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,742
It takes 10 minutes to Miyajimaguchi Station.

106
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:11,142
From there to Hiroshima Station where the hotel is,

107
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,042
it takes 25 minutes by train.

108
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,342
If he returned to the hotel after attacking Mr. Koshiji,

109
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,942
he wouldn't make it back in time.

110
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:21,842
Which means that the only one without an alibi is Mr. Kamisuwa.

111
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:23,442
Come to think of it, even back then...

112
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:26,742
Fire... He was there...

113
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:30,042
Bad news! Misenya's on fire!

114
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,742
What?

115
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:34,373
Fire, on that fire?

116
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,942
It seems he mistook fire to be something else.

117
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:39,242
Wait a sec.

118
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,642
Time wise there's no way

119
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,642
that Mr. Koshiji could've known about the fire.

120
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:46,385
In that case, the "kaji" blurted out by Mr. Koshiji was...

121
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:47,642
Could it be that...

122
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:48,942
"Misenya"

123
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,042
Sonny. Is this the picture you wanted?

124
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:54,742
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:58,042
I had one extra one left that I had printed.

126
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:02,042
The one that I had decorated in the shop burned.

127
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:07,542
Maybe the arsonist wasn't after Misenya, but rather...

128
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:11,542
"Atomic Bomb Dome"

129
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:15,342
The following day, we returned to Hiroshima,

130
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:18,417
and joined Mr. Kitamura who was resting at the hotel.

131
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,442
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you yesterday.

132
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,742
Are you okay?

133
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,042
Yes, totally recovered.

134
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,427
Do you have any idea who could've given you

135
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,742
the drink that gave you the stomachache?

136
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,942
You mean if it's symbolic of anything...

137
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,435
I heard about it a while ago, and was surprised.

138
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,437
Talking of ideas...

139
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,439
All I ate was the lunch box that was brought to us on the site.

140
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,942
Maybe somebody put something inside it.

141
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:48,042
So, what should we do from now?

142
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:52,042
After what Mr. Koshiji went through,

143
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,342
maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...

144
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,142
What is it, try me.

145
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:00,442
I don't think a chance like this comes by often.

146
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:03,442
"Renown Detective of Gourmet Tour Solves the Case!"

147
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,542
I'm sure we'll get high viewer rating!

148
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,442
I agree.

149
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:11,142
-I'd hate to back off like this! -Right!

150
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,342
I'm sure that Mr. Koshiji is also vexed!

151
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:17,342
I'd to clear my name too. Please!

152
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,342
Okay, I'll tell the higher ups.

153
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:26,485
Yatsukawa, you take charge of directing in place of Koshiji.

154
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:27,642
Yes, sir!

155
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:29,842
So, Mr. Mouri.

156
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,491
The contents of the plan may be a bit changed,

157
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:34,493
but we'd appreciate your cooperation.

158
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,842
You can count on me for things like that!

159
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:38,842
That's...

160
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:41,342
-All right! -Let's get to it!

161
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:43,542
We're counting on you, Mr. Hamada!

162
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,842
Will do!

163
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,542
Maybe...

164
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,242
Let's say that if Shinroku believed that

165
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:55,442
the TV staff who came here two years ago

166
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:58,517
had something to do with the death of his parents,

167
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,542
it's possible to think that he attacked the TV crew

168
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,142
taking advantage of the legend of the 7 wonders of Misen

169
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,842
where his parents' died!

170
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,842
But the people who came to Miyajima two years ago

171
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:11,442
are Mr. Koshiji, Mr. Kitamura and Ms. Miyake.

172
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,342
So, isn't it strange that salt would be inserted

173
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:16,535
in Mr. Yatsukawa's coffee, symbolizing the Ebb and Flow Rock,

174
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:17,942
despite he is not having been here?

175
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,742
That's true.

176
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:23,742
Well, it's probably because he's also a staff member.

177
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:27,342
You mean, he who hates Peter harms his dog?

178
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:29,542
Right! That's it!

179
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,342
Which means, I'm next in line as the culprit's target?

180
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:34,553
It could be me.

181
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,642
No matter who the culprit is,

182
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,561
it's for sure that he's going to do something

183
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:45,842
symbolized by the Dragon Fire Cedar of the 7 wonders!

184
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:51,442
We decided to visit Shinroku's friend who resides in Hiroshima.

185
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:54,142
Well, I haven't seen Shinroku

186
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,575
for more than half a year already, you see.

187
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:58,577
"Rainbow Arch Bridge" -After his parents' passed away,

188
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,242
Shinroku went bad,

189
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:03,742
and Yayoi who was going to a two year college in Osaka,

190
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:06,242
returned to Miyajima.

191
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,942
Is he really the culprit?

192
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,642
Come to think of it,

193
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,942
there was no condo.

194
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,342
Don't tell me that...

195
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:22,342
"Hiroshima Castle"

196
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:27,342
Shinroku?

197
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:30,609
I wonder, I have no idea either.

198
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,342
Hey, hey.

199
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:35,542
May I ask you something about 2 years ago?

200
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,142
Yep, about what?

201
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:48,627
I see. Just as I thought!

202
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,142
Shoots! Mr. Kamisuwa's gone!

203
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:56,942
Where is he? Where'd he go?

204
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,342
Yayoi?

205
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,189
Mr. Kamisuwa!

206
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:24,663
Yayoi?

207
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,665
Why...

208
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,189
A dragon pattern?

209
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,489
The last of the 7 wonders that's left.

210
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,589
This symbolizes the Dragon Fire Cedar?

211
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,489
Mr. Kamisuwa's cell phone.

212
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:43,089
Was he attacked from behind while he was on the phone?

213
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,889
Did you see the culprit?

214
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,389
No. When I got here,

215
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,489
Mr. Kamisuwa was already on the ground.

216
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,589
Then, what brought you here?

217
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,489
I got a call from someone

218
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,989
who said he was calling on behalf of my brother.

219
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:01,489
The person told me that my brother said

220
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,701
he wanted to tell only me about what really happened,

221
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,989
so for me to come to Hiroshima Castle.

222
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,989
Someone on behalf of your brother... Really?

223
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,989
-Huh? -Are you suspecting Yayoi?

224
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,789
If the motive of your older brother

225
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:15,389
was to avenge his parents' death,

226
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,717
the same would apply to you his younger sister as well.

227
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,719
Oh, no?

228
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,721
Next, it's me.

229
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,723
Mr. Kamisuwa who didn't come here together

230
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,489
with the staff two years ago was attacked too, so...

231
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,389
If the culprit is attacking at random,

232
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,731
we could be attacked again, too.

233
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,189
Are you saying that

234
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,989
I may not get away with plain salt the next time around?

235
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,737
Because the culprit's attacking at random, you see, at random!

236
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,739
Darn it! What a rat!

237
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:50,389
I'm not letting the culprit do as he pleases any further!

238
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,389
It's our turn next!

239
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,755
What?

240
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,757
Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa?

241
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,759
They passed away?

242
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,889
No joke?

243
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,389
We just got a call from the hospital.

244
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:07,389
Too bad.

245
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,489
Oh, no.

246
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:12,389
Was the killer that guy, Shinroku Ayase after all?

247
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,389
Yes. We got an arrest warrant for him just now.

248
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:17,189
That rat!

249
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:19,089
How dare he kill Mr. Kamisuwa too!

250
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,789
We have him in our custody.

251
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:48,489
It was just as Mr. Mouri had deduced!

252
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,589
He's the culprit!

253
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:53,889
-What? -Oh, no?

254
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:55,089
No way!

255
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,089
You...

256
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,789
Dad.

257
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:07,189
Well, I don't have the slightest idea what's going on either.

258
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,389
So, this is the much rumored Sleeping Kogoro!

259
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:20,839
Mr. Kitamura.

260
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,289
You're the culprit who caused all the incidents up to now!

261
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:27,389
You worked up an elaborate scheme,

262
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,189
which made it look as if Shinroku committed

263
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:32,189
the series of incidents involving the 7 wonders

264
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:34,853
in order to avenge the death of his parents.

265
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:38,389
Your purpose for doing what you did

266
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,889
was to kill the director Mr. Naoto Koshiji!

267
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,289
What?

268
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,289
What do you mean?

269
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,089
Let me explain.

270
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,889
First of all, what gave you the idea of

271
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,869
putting the blame on Shinroku?

272
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:54,873
It was because Mr. Kitamura, you were responsible

273
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:58,189
for his parents falling to their death!

274
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,289
No joke?

275
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,489
In autumn, two years ago,

276
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:01,889
after you finished the interview,

277
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,989
you alone decided to stay back in Miyajima

278
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:06,885
because your hobby was walking through the mountains.

279
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,689
I heard about it from Conan.

280
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,289
Isn't that right, Ms. Miyake?

281
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:14,089
-Yes. -When you climbed Misen,

282
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,895
you entered the off limits area

283
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:20,899
and the parents of Shinroku and Yayoi cautioned you for being there.

284
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,689
I don't know what happened there

285
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,289
but as a result, their parents fell to their deaths.

286
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:33,389
Shinroku searched the site and found an accessory

287
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,189
that turned out to be

288
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:38,489
the mascot on the zipper of the jacket you were wearing.

289
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:43,189
It's the same as the one you have on your bag right now!

290
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,923
Conan!

291
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,925
Yes!

292
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,489
Here you go.

293
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,931
The zipper of Mr. Koshiji's jacket...

294
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,933
Really! It's the same thing!

295
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:56,935
Back then, two years ago,

296
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,489
Mr. Koshiji happened to borrow your jacket and was wearing it.

297
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,941
I think he said, he had a slight cold and was a bit cold,

298
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:04,689
so he wanted to borrow it.

299
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,689
Shinroku found the zipper mascot

300
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:09,589
at the site where his parents fell to the death.

301
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,951
Mr. Kitamura, you're the one who dropped it, aren't you?

302
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,953
What on earth happened back then?

303
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,955
It... It was an accident!

304
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,089
We got into a slight argument and it happened...

305
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,689
I didn't think something like that was going to happen!

306
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,963
Let's have the police thoroughly check out

307
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,965
what really happened then.

308
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,689
Shinroku realized the meaning of the thing that he found,

309
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,289
only two weeks ago,

310
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:37,289
after seeing the photo taken two years ago that

311
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,979
the owner of the souvenir shop had decorated in a picture frame in his shop.

312
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,589
That's why Shinroku mistakenly thought that

313
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,985
Mr. Koshiji was involved with the death of his parents.

314
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,189
Right.

315
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:52,589
So, Shinroku went to Tokyo to confirm the truth of the matter.

316
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,789
Isn't that right, Shinroku?

317
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,389
Yes, sir. Exactly.

318
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,689
I went to Tokyo

319
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,389
and started to investigate the surroundings of

320
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,089
the director called Mr. Koshiji.

321
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,489
Then, I was told,

322
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:11,489
"I'll take you to see him. You can count on me."

323
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,013
Mr. Kitamura approached you.

324
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:15,989
Yes, sir.

325
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,489
You called Shinroku over to Hiroshima

326
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,289
when the crew came to film the program,

327
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,489
and confined him to this room all the while.

328
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,489
Then you attacked Mr. Koshiji taking advantage of the 7 wonders.

329
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:28,689
You also burned the photos that would serve as evidence

330
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:32,289
after disguising yourself as Shinroku, Mr. Kitamura.

331
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,689
Well, but...

332
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:37,035
Mr. Kitamura had an alibi, didn't he?

333
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,037
Mr. Kamisuwa called this hotel

334
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,039
and confirmed that he was sleeping,

335
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,589
and at the time of the fire, Mr. Kitamura himself called.

336
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:47,489
The person that the hotel maid saw sleeping in bed

337
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:50,789
when she checked the room

338
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:53,051
was actually Shinroku who was sleeping

339
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,053
under the influence of sleeping pills.

340
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,489
After shaving and matching the hairstyle,

341
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:00,289
it would be hard to correctly identify the person

342
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,789
even if the police were to confirm how he looks later.

343
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,689
In the meantime, Mr. Kamisuwa saw through Mr. Kitamura's trick.

344
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:09,889
The condo's not there.

345
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:15,889
Yes, he realized that the condo that is in view from this window

346
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:19,077
was not displayed on the screen of the telephone TV.

347
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,889
I confirmed what was going on.

348
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,589
Yes, true.

349
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:27,789
Near the Miyajimaguchi arrival and departure port of the ferry...

350
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:30,789
another chain of our hotel is there.

351
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:33,489
The interior is exactly the same as it is here.

352
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,389
The hotel was used as a stand-in.

353
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,097
He crossed the sea with the ferry,

354
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,689
checked in at the hotel that was nearby,

355
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,789
called Mr. Kamisuwa from there

356
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,289
and established an alibi.

357
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:51,109
But there was only one difference between the two guest rooms.

358
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,111
It's the color of the curtains!

359
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,889
The ones here are sky blue,

360
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,589
but the ones at Miyajimaguchi are peppermint green.

361
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:00,689
That's why he couldn't close the curtains.

362
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,121
But because of the difference in the night scenery,

363
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,989
Mr. Kamisuwa realized this.

364
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:07,889
So...

365
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:10,889
Hello. Is this the Red Leaf Hotel?

366
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,689
You broke the cell phone

367
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,137
because you wanted to hide the fact that

368
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,489
Mr. Kamisuwa called the hotel.

369
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:23,889
You were also thinking of putting the blame on Yayoi

370
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:27,489
who you called simultaneously, if you could possibly could.

371
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:29,147
What?

372
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,289
There seems to have been rumors from before

373
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:35,153
that someone was running an illegal casino.

374
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:39,157
Isn't that someone you, Mr. Kitamura?

375
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,689
Those words that Mr. Koshiji mentioned...

376
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:46,189
Kaji (Fire)... ita (He was there)...

377
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,289
He actually wanted to say,

378
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,889
"Casino... Kitamura was there"!

379
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:54,489
Mr. Koshiji knew what you were doing behind the scenes.

380
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:58,289
Didn't he try to convince you to turn yourself in?

381
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,389
But you went off and told Mr. Kamisuwa that

382
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,489
you thought Mr. Koshiji was doing something suspicious.

383
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:05,183
That's why during the shooting,

384
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,889
Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji were both acting awkwardly.

385
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:12,489
Weren't you also planning to frame Mr. Koshiji who had been killed

386
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:16,489
as the one who was running the illegal casino?

387
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:21,199
I started the casino just for fun at the beginning.

388
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,201
But I got stuck in it over time

389
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,989
and by the time, I realized what was going on, I couldn't quit!

390
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:28,989
I had no other choice!

391
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:30,389
Because you had no choice,

392
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:32,989
you attacked Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa,

393
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:35,213
then tried to put the blame on Shinroku

394
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,215
and tried to get rid of him too?

395
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:39,589
What makes you think that such a selfish justification

396
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:42,189
is going to get you through?

397
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:56,989
That's right, I forgot to mention that

398
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,239
Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa are not dead.

399
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,241
-What? -What?

400
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,389
We got word from the hospital that they got better

401
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,989
and that they've overcome the critical moment.

402
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:11,589
It was all done under my orders.

403
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:15,253
I apologize for ending up in somehow deceiving all of you.

404
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,689
But I thought that by doing this,

405
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,589
the real culprit would relax

406
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:22,589
and go on to try to get rid of Shinroku.

407
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:51,689
Later, Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa's wounds

408
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,789
were well on their way to recovery.

409
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,389
Shinroku also returned to stay with Yayoi

410
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:58,389
and they were safely reunited joyously.

411
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,589
It's hot!

412
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,689
Delicious!

413
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,789
Hiroshima Okonomiyaki is the best!

414
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:14,989
The beer is just great, too!

415
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:17,089
A second serving, please!

416
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,889
But, what's going to happen about putting the program on air?

417
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,189
Hey, hey. We're in trouble if they don't air it.

418
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:25,789
I mean, this is the first time

419
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,289
I'll get to see the fantastic deduction I made with my own eyes, you see.

420
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,789
True, because it's a fact that you're always asleep,

421
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,391
Sir Sleeping Kogoro.

422
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:36,189
By the way, I wonder what's up with Sonoko?

423
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,397
Speak of the devil.

424
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:41,889
Sonoko! What on earth...

425
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,789
Just what's taking you so long, Ran?

426
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,403
Hurry and come over here.

427
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,405
It really feels good this island!

428
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,189
Island?

429
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:53,189
Really, it's really great here in Miyakojima!

430
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:57,089
You made a mistake and went to Miyakojima.

431
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,889
Okay, cut!

432
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,018
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:05,914
"Fountain Pen"

434
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,425
Are you still drinking?

435
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,427
Just one more last drink!

436
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,120
-Let's go already, Ran. -Let's.
