1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,440
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,140
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,640
With the treasure and the girl's smile.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,140
The angel comes down to us at last.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,940
It is time for us to get them all.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,140
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,819
We, the Youth Detective Squad, got a client.

10
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,419
Her name is Yuriko Matsunaka,

11
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,619
a student in the other class of our grade.

12
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,119
She visited us

13
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,819
because her great-grandfather,

14
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,119
Gozo Isegawa, left a riddle and wanted Yuriko to solve it.

15
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,219
And so,

16
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,119
a mysterious guy named Clock took us

17
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,919
to a place called the Angel's Mansion,

18
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,719
to solve the riddle that Gozo Isegawa left behind.

19
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,019
Now it's time.

20
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,019
Here is the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

21
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,219
-What? -What?

22
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,319
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

23
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,619
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

24
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:45,119
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

25
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,119
What are you doing?

26
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,819
That's it! Guys, get off the floor...

27
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,319
Yuriko!

28
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:06,719
"Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 2)"

29
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:11,719
"South Angel Tower's Dungeon"

30
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,819
Hey, guys!

31
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,819
Are you guys okay?

32
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,819
Yeah, I'm okay.

33
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,019
Looks like we really fell down.

34
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,719
Genta...

35
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,319
Hey, something's wrong with Genta!

36
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,419
Hey! Genta...

37
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,419
Another grilled eel, please.

38
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,519
He hasn't slept since last night, right?

39
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,819
Genta!

40
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,719
There's only 9 hours left until the time limit!

41
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:47,819
Where is this? Where are we?

42
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,319
Remember what Mr. Clock said?

43
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,519
Keep in mind, this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

44
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,919
A labyrinth. A labyrinth?

45
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,319
What do we do?

46
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,019
There's nothing we can do but wait.

47
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,819
No way...

48
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,019
So we can't get out of here?

49
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,519
Mitsuhiko, it's all your fault.

50
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,019
What? It's not my fault!

51
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,019
Yeah, it is.

52
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,619
It's because you were trying to be cool in front Yuriko.

53
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,719
You're not that kind of guy. You shouldn't have acted like that.

54
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,419
Okay, but you were doing exactly the same thing,

55
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,219
saying "I'm gonna beat Conan", weren't you?

56
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,319
Haibara and Ayumi, you girls were too!

57
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,819
I just...

58
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,319
I just wanted to...

59
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,819
You too, Conan!

60
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,619
You ran into the Angel's tower, acting all self-righteous!

61
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:42,219
Isn't that why this happened?

62
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,719
You guys should've been waiting outside.

63
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,219
What do you mean by that?

64
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,119
You're saying Yuriko was kidnapped all because of us, not you!

65
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,219
-You wanna fight? -Why not?

66
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,219
It hurts...

67
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,019
Stop!

68
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:09,819
Guys, please don't fight! We're all friends, right?

69
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,319
Yeah, but they're saying it's all my fault.

70
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,619
Who else is going to get Yuriko back

71
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:17,919
if the Youth Detective Squad split up?

72
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,619
She's always alone.

73
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,419
Right now, at this moment too.

74
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,419
Sorry, I was wrong.

75
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,319
No, I was wrong!

76
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,319
No.

77
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,419
I was wrong.

78
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,019
Did Conan just apologize?

79
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,419
He did.

80
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,119
Well, everything's going be fine!

81
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,519
As long as the Youth Detective Squad is together,

82
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,619
this labyrinth is like nothing, right?

83
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:43,619
Yeah, that's right!

84
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,519
It's tough to motivate kids, isn't it?

85
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,219
Shut up.

86
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,619
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

87
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,719
Yes?

88
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,419
You found human bones in the East Mansion, right?

89
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,319
Which direction was the head facing?

90
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,619
The direction?

91
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,219
Let me think.

92
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:01,819
Here's the south,

93
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,319
and I went into the East Mansion one like this, so...

94
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,719
It's facing that way.

95
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,819
The dead man was lying on his stomach, facing the fireplace.

96
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:15,319
I guess that's where the thieves ended up, like Mr. Clock said.

97
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,319
When a man falls down on his stomach,

98
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,919
the head shows where he was heading.

99
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,419
Mitsuhiko already saw that the fireplace

100
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,819
was connected to where the bones were.

101
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,119
So, this labyrinth should lead us at least to the East Mansion.

102
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,919
Great! You're my man!

103
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,219
Yeah, but more important is how we get there

104
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,019
before we become bones, right?

105
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,219
The labyrinth of Minotaur.

106
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,219
What?

107
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:42,919
Hey, remember?

108
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,719
The half-man half bull monster in front of the mansion.

109
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,119
In the ancient Greek myths,

110
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,419
Minotaur is a son of a king, who incurred the God's displeasure,

111
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,219
and the God made Minotaur half-human half-bull.

112
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:59,619
Since Minotaur became awfully violent as he grew up,

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,819
the king decided to put him in a huge labyrinth,

114
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,519
so he could never come out.

115
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,219
So that monster is somewhere in this labyrinth?

116
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,719
Come on. No.

117
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,119
What's important is after that.

118
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:21,219
Every year, the king sent seven Athenian kids to the labyrinth as tribute.

119
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,819
When the hero of Athens, Theseus, heard of this,

120
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,419
he went to challenge the labyrinth and defeated the Minotaur.

121
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,619
He returned from that so-called "Labyrinth of No Return".

122
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,819
By using a ball of string.

123
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,019
-A ball of string? -A ball of strings?

124
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,019
A ball of string?

125
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,819
Right. He tied the string to the gate of the labyrinth,

126
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,719
and pulled it while walking inside.

127
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,219
On the way back, all he needed was to follow the string.

128
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,919
I see.

129
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,319
Then, we should do the same thing

130
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,919
Yeah, we should.

131
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,719
You ladies do not have to do it.

132
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,719
Right, Conan?

133
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:56,819
Right.

134
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,319
Hey look, I think we passed here once already!

135
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay, then I think we should've turned right on that corner, not left.

136
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:35,719
You're all right, Mitsuhiko?

137
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,319
Don't you worry.

138
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,519
I wouldn't catch a cold such an important time.

139
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,019
Don't know if this is enough, the yarns.

140
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,219
Well, I think it's showing how close we got to the exit.

141
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:58,919
Let me help you guys!

142
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,719
Sorry, guys.

143
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,219
Don't worry, man!

144
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,819
Our job is to find a way to get out of here.

145
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:23,819
Your job is to solve the riddle, so just keep thinking.

146
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,019
Genta.

147
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:31,219
That's right! Every man has his own specialty, right?

148
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,619
Mitsuhiko.

149
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,019
You guys...

150
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:39,119
-What's wrong? -The time is over now, isn't it?

151
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,719
No, I just solved the second riddle. But...

152
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,419
Hey, guys, look!

153
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,519
There, that guy.

154
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,019
It's just straight up ahead!

155
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,819
"East Mansion" -We're save.

156
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,219
That was scary.

157
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,919
Yuriko!

158
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,619
-What? -What?

159
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,719
Yuriko, are you all right? Are you hurt?

160
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,019
You jerk!

161
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,819
You planned to kidnap her from the beginning, didn't you?

162
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:16,919
Certainly not.

163
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,219
I just kept Ms. Yuriko away from the pitfall. That's all.

164
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:27,219
I just screamed because he grabbed my arms all of a sudden.

165
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,319
I'm so sorry for causing you trouble.

166
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,519
I really don't know what to say.

167
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,819
Actually, it was pretty fun, wasn't it?

168
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:36,819
Oh, yes.

169
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:40,219
It was just like a little adventure, you know.

170
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,119
Right, Conan?

171
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,819
Yeah, it was.

172
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:52,519
Edogawa, I remember you were saying you solve the second riddle.

173
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,419
Yeah. But we got only three hours or so.

174
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,219
We can no longer see the treasures.

175
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:58,719
-Why not? -Why not?

176
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,819
"The tail becomes the head"

177
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,519
is telling us to head towards that direction, which is north.

178
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,719
And also, "rat" means midnight.

179
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:08,019
So in order to open the North Angel Tower,

180
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:10,919
we have to wait until midnight tonight,

181
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,419
but our challenge ends at 9 pm tonight.

182
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:14,819
No way!

183
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,919
Mr. Clock, you knew the answer of the first part of the riddle, right?

184
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,919
What?

185
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,119
That's why you just saved Yuriko

186
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:25,119
and let the rest of us fall into the pitfall

187
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,419
after finding the black crystal.

188
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,319
No. You planned to get in our way, didn't you?

189
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,019
Less than 3 hours left,

190
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,219
I'm still hoping from my heart that you to solve the riddle.

191
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:52,752
"North Mansion"

192
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:58,452
Here.

193
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,052
One more hour left.

194
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:07,652
There must be a way to open the gate

195
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:09,452
of the North Angel Tower somehow.

196
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,752
Everyone is trying hard.

197
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,252
Think...

198
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:19,852
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

199
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,352
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

200
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,852
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

201
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,552
The angel is scary.

202
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,852
No way.

203
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,252
But if it's true, then...

204
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,052
I see. Now I get it!

205
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,252
A ladder!

206
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,652
Somebody, get me a ladder!

207
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,152
Excuse me, where's a ladder?

208
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:59,752
You need it at the North Angel Tower, the direction of "rat", right?

209
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,052
No, I need it in the East Angel. East!

210
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:03,152
East?

211
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:20,352
"East Angel Tower"

212
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:26,252
-Be careful, Conan! -Good luck!

213
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,252
As I thought.

214
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:52,552
The wait is over. Here comes the flute!

215
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:03,052
Now, what am I going to see

216
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:06,352
when this light hits the Angel in the direction of "rat".

217
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:12,252
An angel will come down and play the flute of the black crystal

218
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,452
to show us the treasures.

219
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,552
Hey, it's over there.

220
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,052
An angel has come down to the forest!

221
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:36,052
-What? -Are you serious?

222
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,352
It's the shadow.

223
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:39,352
The shadow of the angel, playing the flute!

224
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:42,052
"The song of the angel is my very treasure", right?

225
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:44,052
It's on the hill where the charcoal burner's lodge is.

226
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:47,952
That's where "the song of angel" came down!

227
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:51,452
I got it! We still got 30 minutes.

228
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,252
Now let's go!

229
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,652
Mr. Clock?

230
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:08,152
It is Yuriko's treasure!

231
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,852
You're an adult. Good adults don't steal things!

232
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,452
Mr. Clock.

233
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,652
No, it's not that. Yuri...

234
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:19,652
Do not interrupt me. There's no time.

235
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:36,652
Oh, no!

236
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,752
No more labyrinth, please!

237
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,552
-I can't see! -I can't see!

238
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:58,652
This is Mr. Gozo Isegawa's,

239
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,852
Yuriko's great-grandfather's treasures, isn't it?

240
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:05,552
What is that?

241
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:10,552
The game is over, Mr. Clock.

242
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,952
Tell us the truth.

243
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:16,452
I know you were trying to get these treasures from the beginning.

244
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:17,752
You were Mr. Isegawa's secretary.

245
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,652
You heard and solved the all the riddles

246
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,552
before anybody else, right?

247
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:22,752
Solved everything...

248
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:27,052
Yeah, but in the same way as I did, in the wrong way.

249
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,352
The fact that he told us the riddles in the evening shows that.

250
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:33,152
I'm sorry but it's not time yet.

251
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,152
If he presents the riddle at 9 pm,

252
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:36,652
the challenger has to wait until the noon of the next day,

253
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:39,452
to get into the North Angel Tower.

254
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:40,852
When the challenger realized the second question,

255
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:44,452
in which he has to go into the North Angel Tower

256
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:47,452
But the earliest he can get into the Tower is the midnight of that day.

257
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:48,852
So no matter how hard you try,

258
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:51,652
there's no way you can break it within 24 hours.

259
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,152
No! It wasn't me...

260
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:57,352
But if he really wanted the treasure,

261
00:16:57,352 --> 00:17:00,852
he could've tried his deduction

262
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,752
and realized the flaw in the riddle, don't you think?

263
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:07,152
Sure he could, but he didn't.

264
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,252
Because it would be a crime if he snatched the treasure!

265
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:13,852
He wanted to have the treasure officially.

266
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,652
Officially...

267
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:17,352
What I'm trying to say is

268
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:20,552
he is the one with the 18th right of inheritance.

269
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:26,552
It makes sense that he was watching us, interfering with us,

270
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,652
erasing all the clues the previous challengers left,

271
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,452
because he was waiting for his turn.

272
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:38,052
No! It was Master's, Mr. Isegawa's, will to set the riddle time at 9 pm.

273
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:40,352
Yeah, right. Who would believe that?

274
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,252
I would! Because...

275
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,252
Because that knife wasn't to hurt us,

276
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:47,452
but to make us realize the presence of the high-voltage current.

277
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:50,752
The footsteps sounded like it was an adult.

278
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:53,052
He is the only adult in here!

279
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,252
I don't think he was trying to monitor or interfere with us.

280
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,952
I think he was trying to protect Yuriko and us.

281
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,152
Now, please, be careful.

282
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:04,052
Some of the security systems are actually quite dangerous.

283
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:08,252
I think so too. Mr. Clock isn't a bad person.

284
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,452
Yuriko!

285
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:13,052
When I was in that room...

286
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:33,452
Okay, Fair enough.

287
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:36,352
Yuriko's parents gave up on their grandfather and left the house.

288
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,352
Ai, I don't think that's...

289
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,552
Because of his nature of hating people.

290
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,752
There's no way such person

291
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:44,952
would tell his secret to a stranger even if he's the secretary

292
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:47,752
So, my point is Mr. Clock is related to Mr. Isegawa.

293
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,752
He's related to my great-grandfather.

294
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,852
But at the same time, he was also someone Mr. Isegawa hated so much

295
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:56,052
so that he had to lose his name,

296
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,352
execute his master's will,

297
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:01,152
and remain in this mansion until someone solves the riddle.

298
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:04,652
There's only one person we can think of here.

299
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,452
Probably, you are...

300
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:08,952
Okay, that's enough!

301
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:12,252
It wasn't the gold blocks Mr. Clock was trying to reach!

302
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,352
It was that.

303
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:18,452
Yuriko?

304
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:22,052
No! It's Mr. Isegawa's granddaughter,

305
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,852
Which is also Mr. Clock's wife.

306
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:28,352
What? So that means Mr. Clock is Yuriko's...

307
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:29,852
He's Yuriko's father.

308
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:34,052
He's someone Mr. Isegawa hated the most but also related to him.

309
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:39,852
Yuriko's father must be the one because he ran away with his wife!

310
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:47,052
Mr. Isegawa loved his granddaughter, Yuriko's mother, so much.

311
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:51,152
He said she reminded him of his wife a lot.

312
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:56,252
So, he was desperate to get her back when we ran away from him.

313
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:57,252
"Grandfather"

314
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:59,752
Around that time, he had a lot of connections

315
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,352
with the underground community.

316
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:04,852
I didn't know what he would do if he got mad.

317
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:07,952
So I decided to leave my wife and Yuriko who was just born,

318
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,852
to protect them.

319
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,552
I made a deal with Mr. Isegawa.

320
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:16,152
I work for him so he leaves my family alone.

321
00:20:16,152 --> 00:20:18,352
To ease his anger, it was necessary to serve him

322
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,552
with all my heart and soul.

323
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:26,052
Master, it's getting windy now.

324
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:30,052
I know but I like doing this.

325
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:37,452
And one day I realized,

326
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,052
he truly loved his family

327
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:41,952
from the bottom of his heart.

328
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:45,052
He didn't know the way to show it well.

329
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,952
Raging Bull was a difficult

330
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:51,052
but kind old man who valued his family.

331
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:54,552
And it was last year that Mr. Isegawa suddenly started saying that

332
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:58,252
he wanted to settle with his granddaughter or Yuriko's mother.

333
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:03,752
So I looked for my family and found out about my wife's death.

334
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:06,552
Mr. Isegawa collapsed rapidly with disappointment

335
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:09,252
and died with the riddle.

336
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:12,352
Presentation of the riddle is 9 pm.

337
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:15,552
If the riddle is solved, you are free.

338
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:18,052
Forgive me, Matsunaka.

339
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:24,652
I'm Yoshito Matsunaka,

340
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:26,252
Yuriko's father.

341
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:32,052
Your mother made that riddle when she was a child.

342
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:33,552
Mom made it?

343
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:37,552
Yes. So great-granddad chose that riddle

344
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:39,652
because there was only one person who would know the answer.

345
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:43,852
It's you, because you're her daughter.

346
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,952
Dad!

347
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:51,552
Yuriko. Sorry.

348
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:53,852
I'm sorry. Yuriko.

349
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:30,952
Later, Mr. Clock decided to change the Angel's Mansion

350
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:34,452
into a theme park of bulls and labyrinth,

351
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:38,852
simply because Yuriko said it was her great-grandfather's dream.

352
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,152
Haibara.

353
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,652
I think so too.

354
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:47,852
Probably, Mr. Isegawa made that huge labyrinth secretly,

355
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:51,252
to please his kids.

356
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:54,352
And also, to rebuild his family relationship.

357
