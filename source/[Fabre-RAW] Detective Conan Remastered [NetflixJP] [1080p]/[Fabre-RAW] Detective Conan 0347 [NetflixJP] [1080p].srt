1
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,801
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:13,801
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,601
There's a strange mark on Ayumi and Genta.

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,501
The key to the case is in the car.

5
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,101
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,001
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,201
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,729
On the way back from school in the rain,

9
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,429
Ayumi bumps into a serial killer on the run.

10
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,729
She didn't get to see his face

11
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,729
but the mark of, probably, the belongings of the culprit

12
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,429
that resembled the number "5"

13
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,529
was left on the palm of her hand.

14
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:15,429
And the same mark was also found on Genta's buttocks!

15
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,529
Don't tell me that...

16
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,429
This! It's this mark!

17
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:25,329
The key-shaped bloodstain

18
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,529
was on the sleeve of Ayumi's clothes.

19
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:30,729
This serves as proof that the culprit grabbed the key

20
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:33,729
with hands soiled with the blood of the victim and fled!

21
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:37,529
This means that the culprit will not show the police the key,

22
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:40,629
which he knows will display haematological response!

23
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:50,429
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 2)"

24
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:52,029
"The Metropolitan Police Department, Beika Police Station"

25
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,529
Only three?

26
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:56,629
Are you serious, Inspector Megure?

27
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,729
Yes.

28
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,729
One that was stopped at the checkpoint

29
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,929
and two others that were driving around in the vicinity!

30
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,229
They're car owners who are nearby residents that have no alibi

31
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,629
and who are saying that they've lost their master keys.

32
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:10,729
At any rate,

33
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:15,129
I'm going to have the three people go over to you right now.

34
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,729
If you got a glimpse of the serial killer,

35
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,029
I'd like you to make a confirmation too!

36
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,829
Yes, sir! I understand!

37
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:24,929
The three suspects are on their way here right now!

38
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:25,929
Good!

39
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,329
It's as if we've already arrested the culprit!

40
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,429
Ayumi heard the culprit's voice.

41
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:36,529
So, he'll probably go pale when he sees her!

42
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,329
Yes, I'm sure!

43
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,929
I'll do my best!

44
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,829
I'm against it.

45
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:46,629
It the culprit is really among the three,

46
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:50,729
you meet him and he gets arrested, that's fine.

47
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,529
But what if he's acquitted because of lack of evidence?

48
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:58,529
The culprit's going to hold a grudge on you for putting him in a fix,

49
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:03,029
come after you and may take revenge on you one day!

50
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,429
Even more so if he's a serial killer who's killing people at random,

51
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,229
don't you think so?

52
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,829
You're taking your imagination too far, Haibara.

53
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,429
I'm trying to say don't go taking a reckless risk

54
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:16,029
when there isn't sufficient evidence yet!

55
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,029
But I'm the one who saw the culprit at the closest range,

56
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,029
so I may be able to tell who the culprit is

57
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,029
if you make them wear raincoats, right?

58
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,929
You can confirm that just looking at pictures too, right?

59
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:30,929
As for the voice, you can listen to the recorded voice.

60
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:32,929
There's no need to go any further

61
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,229
and leave a stronger impression on the culprit

62
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,229
than you already have.

63
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,329
Just as Haibara's pointing out,

64
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:42,229
it's too risky to meet the culprit directly.

65
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,929
But it's vexing to let the three suspects go off just like that

66
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,029
after questioning them too.

67
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,929
There's no guarantee that they'll be no more victims either.

68
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,329
Maybe it's better to just keep a distance

69
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,829
and peek in secretly for now, right?

70
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,229
Okay! This way...

71
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,329
Stop!

72
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:05,429
Please get out of the car one by one,

73
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,929
tell me your name and what you do.

74
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,529
Please also tell me where and what you

75
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:11,829
were doing at the time of the crime, around 14:00.

76
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,629
First, from you at the far left.

77
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:14,829
Geez.

78
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,429
I came here voluntarily

79
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,529
and you treat me like I'm the culprit.

80
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,029
"Hiroshi Enomoto (21)" -I'm Hiroshi Enomoto.

81
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,129
I'm a university student working part-time

82
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,329
at a sushi shop at Sanchome!

83
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,729
Did you buy this car with the money you made

84
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:26,929
from working part-time?

85
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:29,629
No. I leeched off my parents.

86
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,629
Is there a problem with that?

87
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,129
I see.

88
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,629
If through smoked glass,

89
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:37,229
they can't see us from their side.

90
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,929
And does the voice of that man sound familiar?

91
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,229
It sounds familiar and yet doesn't.

92
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,029
It's my day off today.

93
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:49,729
Last night my boss scolded me

94
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,729
so I was feeling bummed out

95
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,529
and decided to get it off my chest by going to the mountains,

96
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,329
when I was nabbed at the checkpoint.

97
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,929
You were going to the mountains to get it off your chest?

98
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,729
Well, the scenery in that area is nice

99
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,429
so I feel refreshed.

100
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:07,529
No wonder the body of the car is soiled and full of scratches.

101
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,029
Next! You, in the middle!

102
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,429
Oh, yes.

103
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:15,129
Hey! Don't you go banging my car around!

104
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,929
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:21,429
I'm not really good at driving

106
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,429
but I'm good at repairing.

107
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:25,529
Which means you work as...

108
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:26,829
Oh, yes.

109
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,129
"Naokazu Fukuchi (36)" -I work at an automobile repair factory.

110
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,429
My name is Naokazu Fukuchi.

111
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,129
The factory is closed today

112
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,729
but my car was not in the best condition,

113
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,329
so I was confined in the factory since morning repairing it.

114
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,229
But there are reports of you being seen driving around town.

115
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,029
I was just driving around the shopping arcade to check

116
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,329
if the car was totally repaired!

117
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:49,729
Is anything wrong with that?

118
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,129
No.

119
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,329
Next.

120
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,529
Yeah.

121
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,229
"Toshiaki Degawa (43)" -My name's Toshiaki Degawa.

122
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,629
I'm a locksmith and my shop's located on Ichome.

123
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,429
How wretched of me despite being a locksmith,

124
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,729
to lose the master key.

125
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,729
Your car, unlike the other two, is sure nice and shiny.

126
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,929
Yeah, I go get a car wash each time I go out.

127
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:21,129
This car is my heart and soul, you know?

128
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,829
Which means you went out this afternoon too?

129
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,029
I got a call saying that the client lost her house key

130
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,829
and wanted me to unlock the door.

131
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,929
But since she didn't explain her address very well,

132
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,729
I was going around in circles looking for the house.

133
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,629
However, I didn't get to see her at all.

134
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,329
She called again and say that her boyfriend who had a spare key came,

135
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:42,129
so that I didn't have to go.

136
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,429
Has anything dawned on you so far?

137
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,629
Nothing at all.

138
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,729
Besides, they're not shouting.

139
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,729
All three of them are about the same height and physique.

140
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,129
Hey, over there!

141
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,629
What're you whispering about?

142
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:55,929
Oh, well...

143
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,029
Hey.

144
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,429
Officer Takagi

145
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,629
I've got a little favor to ask you.

146
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:02,929
What is it?

147
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,129
What could it be?

148
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,029
You see...

149
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:10,129
I'll go see him, after all.

150
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,329
What?

151
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,429
If I go closer and take a look,

152
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:14,529
I may be able to figure out the culprit.

153
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,129
No! Didn't I just tell you that

154
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,029
if the culprit doesn't get arrested,

155
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,929
something terrible may happen to you.

156
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:24,129
But...

157
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,029
Not only you.

158
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,429
There's a possibility that the culprit would come

159
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:31,029
to take revenge on anyone who was involved with you too.

160
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,429
Although I know how you feel about wanting to punish the bad guy,

161
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,229
but to hold back your feelings no matter how strong

162
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,229
and keeping out of the picture also requires a lot of courage too.

163
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,029
Yes. This is the right thing to do

164
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,129
for yourself as well as for all the others.

165
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,229
That's the story.

166
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,329
What? You want me to call the forensic officer

167
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,529
and get a minus screwdriver?

168
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,629
Yup.

169
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:57,429
I think everything will clear up.

170
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,529
And we'll all find out who the big fat liar serial killer

171
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,329
that is resorting to cheap tricks to hide his crime is.

172
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:08,629
Yes, it's him.

173
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:10,129
Well, at any rate,

174
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,729
you're going to have to leave your cars

175
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,929
at the police station for a while.

176
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,929
There are a lot more things we'd like to check on.

177
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,029
Hey...

178
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,329
You got to be kidding.

179
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:22,429
I came here to Beika Police Station voluntarily.

180
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,429
Why are you taking things so far as to keep my car in police custody?

181
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,229
Please give us a convincing explanation too.

182
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:33,729
Why were we summoned here as suspects of a serial killer case?

183
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,029
If you called us in just because we don't have an alibi

184
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,029
during the time of the crime,

185
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:40,129
I'm sure there are a lot of other people too.

186
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,529
First of all, it's your car!

187
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,929
All of them are from the same brand and model.

188
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,129
Yeah.

189
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,229
Moreover, all three of you say you've lost your master key.

190
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,129
When the serial killer fled,

191
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,029
he dropped the car key of this car with the emblem of the brand on it.

192
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,429
We already have reports that the culprit picked the key up

193
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,929
with hands smeared with the blood of the victim.

194
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,229
We also know that he came back to the site of the crime to confirm

195
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,029
whether the police had a lead on him.

196
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,029
We also know based on the testimony of a witness

197
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,229
that the culprit is very likely a resident of this vicinity

198
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,929
who knows he'll be in hot water

199
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:19,229
once the police start checking on him.

200
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,929
The person who own this car model

201
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,429
have no alibi,

202
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,129
live nearby

203
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,429
and cannot show us your master key

204
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,829
because it is smeared with blood

205
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,429
are only three of you.

206
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:35,329
I told you I really just lost my key.

207
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,129
Well, a simple check by those forensic officers

208
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,029
will clear all of that in no time at all.

209
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,429
-Check? -What?

210
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,929
We're just going to check for luminol reactions.

211
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:50,629
Officer Takagi, please have them begin.

212
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,429
Yeah.

213
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,229
Please do as I told you over the phone then.

214
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:57,829
Yes, sir.

215
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,629
First, start from Mr. Enomoto's car on the far left.

216
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:01,729
Hey...

217
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,029
Don't tell me that you're going to search the inside of the car

218
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,829
for the master key?

219
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:07,029
Even if you're the police,

220
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,129
you couldn't possibly do something outrageous like that!

221
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,329
Don't worry. We won't check inside your car.

222
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,129
Hey, Conan?

223
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,529
What on earth are you going to check?

224
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,529
If I were the culprit,

225
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,129
I would've thrown the blood stained key away long time ago!

226
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,029
Silly. It's not the key that's being checked.

227
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:28,129
We're checking the keyhole of the door of the driver's seat side

228
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,829
that the culprit stuck the key in when he fled.

229
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,129
I see! Blood should be there too, right?

230
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,429
But even if blood were found there,

231
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:39,729
it would be a very small amount.

232
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,629
Will you really be able to make it out?

233
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:42,829
Of course.

234
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:45,429
Luminol reaction is very sensitive

235
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:47,629
and can detect the slightest amount of blood.

236
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,729
Yeah. The culprit went out all out as to think up a cheap trick

237
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:53,129
and lie in order to hide the fact.

238
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,929
A lie? Cheap trick?

239
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,829
Try and remember

240
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,529
what the three said about

241
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,729
what they were doing at the time of the crime.

242
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,129
Let's see.

243
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,929
Mr. Enomoto was headed for the mountains to take a drive.

244
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,829
Mr. Fukuchi drove around the shopping arcade

245
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,829
to check if his car was repaired.

246
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,429
And Mr. Degawa was going around looking for the house of the person

247
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,629
who said she lost the house keys.

248
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,029
Why does that make them liars?

249
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,829
Then, take a look!

250
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,029
The car of Mr. Degawa who says his car is his heart and soul

251
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,429
is sparkling clean.

252
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:28,929
Mr. Fukuchi who says he's a lousy driver

253
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:31,129
has his car parked really near the next car.

254
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,529
And the speed racer Mr. Enomoto's car

255
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,929
is full of scratches and soiled.

256
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,329
You understand, now, don't you?

257
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,929
Not at all!

258
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,129
Genta, how did you practice riding the bicycle?

259
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,929
I practiced together with mom

260
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,529
at a back road where not too many people were.

261
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,829
Because it'd be dangerous bumping into people.

262
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,329
Oh! I see!

263
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,229
Mr. Fukuchi is lying!

264
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:57,029
If he's not good at driving

265
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:58,929
he wouldn't even try driving through a shopping arcade

266
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,729
where there are a lot of people!

267
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,429
Besides at the time of the crime,

268
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,929
it was raining and his vision would be poorer than usual.

269
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,629
It's the worse course to try out a car

270
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,529
that you're not even sure is working right.

271
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,929
Moreover, Mr. Fukuchi parked his car completely parallel

272
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,829
to the car next to his.

273
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,529
That's only proof that he's an extremely good driver!

274
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,229
If he's not good, he's car would be a bit crooked.

275
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:24,529
Then, the culprit is Mr. Fukuchi and he's the liar?

276
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,729
Yes, he parked his car very close to the next car

277
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,629
to make checking the keyhole of the door difficult.

278
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,829
But, it's all over now.

279
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,829
Look, the car next to his was moved,

280
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,029
so the keyhole on the driver's seat side is in clear view.

281
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,929
I'm sure there'll be a response

282
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,429
if luminol is sprayed onto the keyhole.

283
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,929
A bluish-purple color should be emitted

284
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,129
when it chemically reacts to blood.

285
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,429
No reaction.

286
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,129
No way.

287
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:11,784
Really?

288
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,984
Hey.

289
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:15,184
Just what does this mean, Officer Takagi?

290
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:18,584
You said so confidently that this would specify the culprit.

291
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:22,684
Well, it was supposed to work out that way.

292
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:45,984
Excuse me, could you lend me a minus screwdriver?

293
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:48,684
A minus screwdriver?

294
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:50,484
Here you go.

295
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,484
Thank you.

296
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:55,384
So, are you satisfied now?

297
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:57,884
Since all three cars showed no reaction,

298
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,884
can we go now?

299
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,884
Now you know that we're not the serial killer, right?

300
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,984
Please calm down.

301
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,584
What's going on, Conan?

302
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,784
It's not like you said at all.

303
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:15,284
Where's Conan?

304
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:17,384
He went that way just now,

305
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,284
after taking a minus screwdriver from the forensic officer.

306
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,384
What?

307
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:30,484
This keyhole moves like a slime

308
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,084
when pushed from outside?

309
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:33,184
What?

310
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,284
I wonder what it is?

311
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:38,884
Oh, hey!

312
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,684
Hey, sonny!

313
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:59,984
The key cylinder is fixed in place with vinyl tape!

314
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,584
I see.

315
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,884
He changed it on the spur of the moment

316
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,984
with the cylinder of another car,

317
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,484
thinking that the police would check it out.

318
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,484
Which means that the real reason

319
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:11,084
why he parked his car really close to the next car is...

320
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:13,084
To hide this.

321
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:16,184
Unless you open the door this way and remove the cover,

322
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,284
you can't check how the key cylinder is on the inside.

323
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,984
Then, don't tell me that...

324
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:26,884
Conan had foreseen all this to begin with.

325
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:33,484
No. This key cylinder is really the one for this car!

326
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:36,484
I goofed when trying to set it up and broke it.

327
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:40,184
It's just a temporary measure until a replacement arrives.

328
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:43,784
Will you show us the key to this car, then?

329
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:46,984
As well as the car number that is carved into it!

330
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,984
You should know since you're an auto mechanic.

331
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:52,084
That there are numbers on the key cylinder

332
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:54,084
of the driver's seat side of the car.

333
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,284
If we compare the two,

334
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:57,884
we can tell whether it's the same key.

335
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:02,684
Or would you like us to spray luminol onto the key cylinder

336
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:05,084
of the ignition beside the steering wheel?

337
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,984
I'm sure blood reaction will be displayed,

338
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,984
because the key cylinder of the ignition is sealed

339
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:13,784
and cannot be changed in a short period of time.

340
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:18,184
Okay!

341
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,784
I'll show you the key number!

342
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:30,484
I'm sure the key is in the dashboard compartment.

343
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:36,884
Oh, hey!

344
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,784
Open the door, will you?

345
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,884
This guy confessed later that he did what he did

346
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:06,184
because he wanted public attention.

347
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:10,084
It seems he was just seeking stimulation in his mundane life.

348
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,884
However, since in this serial killer case,

349
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,684
there are no casualties...

350
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:16,684
No...

351
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,484
That doesn't redeem him at all.

352
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,884
It turned out that this stupid attention seeker

353
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:26,084
just jostled the area around the Beika Police Station a bit

354
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,184
and the case was closed.

355
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:35,284
I'm sure glad that the culprit was caught though!

356
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:38,984
We don't have to worry about Ayumi being pursued by the culprit anymore!

357
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,784
I don't mind being pursued!

358
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,684
Why?

359
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,984
Because I know Conan will protect me.

360
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,384
Hey...

361
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:56,584
Of course, I was counting on Mitsuhiko, Genta and Ai too!

362
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,384
I know I'd be totally fine!

363
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,484
Sorry.

364
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:12,584
I have something I have to do.

365
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:15,584
Bye-bye.

366
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:22,584
Bye-bye!

367
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,084
See you!

368
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,484
My, how nice of you.

369
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:03,684
To come visit me.

370
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,984
If I let time pass by,

371
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:11,084
I felt like I was going to change my mind, that's why.

372
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,984
So, you've made up your mind.

373
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:17,284
As to whether to accept the witness protection program or not.

374
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:18,984
Yes.

375
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:20,084
Of course.

376
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,684
Of course...

377
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:28,984
I'm declining.

378
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:33,584
It's probably true

379
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,084
that I'd be safe if I change my name and address

380
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,084
and become an entirely different person.

381
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:41,284
But I'd have to go over the same thing again anyway.

382
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:43,684
I'll be living a vicious circle of fear and hiding,

383
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:44,684
then becoming another person

384
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:48,384
when the danger of my identity being revealed comes around!

385
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:51,184
Besides, there is no guarantee that

386
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,484
I can completely trust you FBI agents.

387
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:56,884
And besides...

388
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,684
Although I know how you feel about wanting to punish the bad guy,

389
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:05,084
but keeping out of the picture also requires a lot of courage too.

390
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:06,884
But...

391
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,684
But I...

392
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,184
don't want to run!

393
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,784
I can't win just by running around!

394
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:15,184
I can never win!

395
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:21,184
I don't want to run.

396
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:27,884
So, you've decided against it after all.

397
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:29,784
You're not going to try to convince me otherwise?

398
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:31,184
Well...

399
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:36,984
Of course, I'm against your idea as an FBI agent but...

400
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,284
since I experienced

401
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:41,884
somebody coming after my life when I was still a child.

402
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:46,684
I'd like you to cherish how you feel right now!

403
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,184
Hang in there.

404
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,284
See you.

405
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:11,384
Geez.

406
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:14,784
It's like I'm watching you as a child.

407
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:18,084
You, who kept denying to accept the witness protection program.

408
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:21,584
And in the end, shouted defiantly to let you join the FBI

409
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:23,184
in exchange for accepting the program.

410
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:26,084
Wrong, James.

411
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:31,584
She seems to already have what I lacked back then.

412
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:35,484
Yes.

413
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:37,484
Something that is very dangerous

414
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:40,884
and capable of breeding disaster.

415
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:43,984
But yet a very warm thing that gives you courage.

416
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,753
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,053
"Seal"

418
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:38,953
The next episode is the off-season mystery.

419
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:40,853
I'm scared! Mother!
