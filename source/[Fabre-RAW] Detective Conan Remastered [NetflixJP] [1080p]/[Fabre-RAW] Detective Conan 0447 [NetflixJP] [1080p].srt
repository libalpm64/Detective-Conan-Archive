1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,901
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:05,801
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,501
Finally solved is the mystery of the mansion.

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,001
Officer Yamamura is not his usual self.

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:10,801
Everyone is surprised and amazed!

6
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,101
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,801
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,601
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,817
On the way to Sonoko's villa,

10
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:02,417
we run into an accident.

11
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:05,117
So we decided to borrow the phone at a villa nearby.

12
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,117
The villa happens to be a place

13
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:10,117
where members of a popular rock band "Dorcus" bought.

14
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:11,317
It was a mansion with a story behind it.

15
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,817
A devil is said to live in it.

16
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,217
And...

17
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:19,817
one of the members,

18
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:21,717
Rinko Honami dies.

19
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,317
But I began to doubt it was a suicide.

20
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:29,617
So this is nothing other than suicide.

21
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,717
Its what you think I might say, but the fact is otherwise.

22
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:39,417
This is a locked-room murder that was cleverly set up by someone!

23
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,217
And the murderer is among you.

24
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:50,217
"Sealed Western-style Window (Part 2)"

25
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:51,717
Wait a minute.

26
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:55,217
Do you mean there is a murderer among us?

27
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,017
It's a joke, isn't it?

28
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:59,017
I want you to explain

29
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:02,917
how this became a locked-room case.

30
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,017
I was just stating an example.

31
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:10,517
Well, let us hear it, shall we?

32
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:13,717
When and where did you see Rinko for the last time?

33
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,517
Before her body was discovered,

34
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:20,217
-Ran, please put me down. -where and what were you all doing?

35
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:22,117
The last time I saw her

36
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:26,517
was when she stormed into the next room shouting at us about the noise.

37
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:31,517
Afterwards, I went upstairs to my room to practice with my guitar.

38
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:33,117
"Yoji Kuramoto (28)" -Until Toru began shouting

39
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:36,117
that something was wrong with Rinko in front of this room.

40
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:37,917
When Rinko yelled and came into the room,

41
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,417
you both were there, weren't you?

42
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,817
Yeah.

43
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:42,217
"Toru Tendou (30)" -After that,

44
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,717
I was listening to CDs in my room right above this room.

45
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:50,417
And I remembered that I haven't give the CD Rinko asked me to buy,

46
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:53,417
so I went down to Rinko's room.

47
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:56,317
"Jun Makino (29)" -I was arranging books in the room

48
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,617
where Rinko shouted at us earlier.

49
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:00,317
Since the previous owner had said

50
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,117
in return for selling the house for a cheap price,

51
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,117
he wanted us to get rid whatever was left in the villa on our own.

52
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,717
I was sorting out and choosing books that I thought could be sold.

53
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:11,217
I had no trouble choosing the books,

54
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,217
because all the book in this house were in order.

55
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,217
But...

56
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:20,917
I wonder why the owner leave everything behind?

57
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,417
He probably didn't want to come back here again.

58
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:28,417
The owner's brother and his brother's wife commit suicide here.

59
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:31,817
He even left the window that the demon is said to come through as it was.

60
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,517
Did you say a devil?

61
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,317
Do you want to see it?

62
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,417
It is in the next room which I was in before.

63
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:51,017
It's true.

64
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,817
It sure looks like a devil came through it.

65
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,317
I heard that's why it was closed off.

66
00:04:56,317 --> 00:05:00,217
The elder brother of the wealthy brothers who built this villa did this.

67
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,217
How can you sleep in a room like this?

68
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,017
This is your room, isn't it?

69
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:06,017
No, sir.

70
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:10,517
My room is on the first floor which was used by the younger brother's wife.

71
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:13,117
This is the maid's room,

72
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,617
which is why it doesn't look as furnished.

73
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,217
But don't you think it's unnatural?

74
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,417
The maid's room were on the second floor

75
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,517
and the owner's wife on the first floor.

76
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:22,817
It seems she had a physical disability,

77
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,317
so she stayed on the first floor with no stairs.

78
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:28,717
Well, I'm sleeping in the elder brother's room

79
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:30,917
who is said to have committed suicide without problem.

80
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:33,917
This sure was the elder brother's room.

81
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,317
There are a lot of fine furniture here.

82
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:43,317
There are four windows facing the backyard.

83
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:46,017
It is the same size as Rinko's room.

84
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:49,817
This is a really gorgeous room.

85
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,617
This belonged to the younger of the rich brothers.

86
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,917
Well, I guess you could say that

87
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,417
the elder brother's wife committed suicide because of the younger brother.

88
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:02,917
When we bought this house, we were told a story.

89
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,717
The reason the older brother's wife committed suicide

90
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,317
was because the older brother found out

91
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:08,517
that she was having an affair with his younger brother and he accused her.

92
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:11,117
Maybe the older brother regretted driving her to death

93
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:13,917
and killed himself.

94
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,317
An affair?

95
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:16,517
Yes.

96
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,317
The younger brother and his older brother's wife

97
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:21,417
seems to have been secretly contacting each other since they came here

98
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,117
and saw each other at nights.

99
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:29,217
Anyway, let me consult with a senior officer about the case.

100
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:30,517
You all wait here for now.

101
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:49,117
Just as I thought.

102
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,417
The tree branches are in the way,

103
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,617
so only the window on the second floor is in view.

104
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:55,217
Which means that behind the lid of the bird nest...

105
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,617
I thought so.

106
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,617
There's a slot to slide the plate in.

107
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:03,317
There's no doubt about it.

108
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,117
The one who killed Rinko and made it look like a suicide

109
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:07,817
is that person.

110
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,917
All by utilizing the story

111
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,717
of this villa's demon.

112
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:24,017
Well, after asking the senior officer,

113
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:28,817
an incident seems to have happened here at the villa two years ago.

114
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,817
The people who died back then

115
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,817
were the older of the two brothers and his wife.

116
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:36,417
First, the older brother's wife committed suicide

117
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:40,217
using a rope in her room on the second floor.

118
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,417
Three days later, the older brother killed himself

119
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:46,017
by jumping from his room on the third floor.

120
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:48,817
The room in which the older brother's wife killed herself using a rope

121
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:54,417
seems to have been the same room where Rinko Honami was found dead.

122
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:58,117
The incident occurred after the older brother nailed down the window,

123
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:01,817
saying, "A devil has come to live here."

124
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:05,617
He then renovated the walls and floors of the house.

125
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:10,417
The locals became frightened and call it the villa where the devil resides.

126
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,117
So we'll be going to the police station.

127
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,217
What? You're leaving?

128
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,417
Shouldn't you investigate more in detail?

129
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,917
Like, who the ominous silhouetted figure

130
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,617
that was looking out from the supposedly sealed window.

131
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:31,017
What? You saw that?

132
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,217
Well, yes.

133
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:34,817
From the backyard where the window is in view.

134
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:36,617
If so, the more I'll be on my way.

135
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,417
-What? -What? Why?

136
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,117
Because it's a devil! A devil!

137
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,417
The police could never catch something like that!

138
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:46,317
Hey.

139
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:51,417
Besides, the room where Rinko hung herself was completely sealed.

140
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,417
The door key was found in the center of the room, too.

141
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,117
Rinko was possessed by the devil, that's why she committed suicide.

142
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:58,817
That's the only thing thinkable, right?

143
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:02,817
Then, was the prank played in that room also the work of the devil?

144
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:04,617
Prank?

145
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:08,617
Because 3 came after 6, and 1 came after 4!

146
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:11,617
But the others were all in sequential order!

147
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,217
Just what are you talking about?

148
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,317
Ignore him!

149
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:19,217
He's just a brat.

150
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:22,817
By the way, may we get on with what we need to do?

151
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:25,617
Since such a terrible thing happened to one of our band members.

152
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:29,017
We want to discuss how we'll go about things from now on.

153
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,817
Yes, you may,

154
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:35,317
but I advise you all to get out of here as soon as possible.

155
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,117
When Rinko committed suicide,

156
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:41,617
Ms. Jun Makino was in the room next door, which is the maid's room.

157
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:44,617
The window that has been sealed with nails is also there.

158
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,517
At that time, Mr. Yoji Kuramoto was in the room

159
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:49,517
on the third floor right above Ms. Jun Makino,

160
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:53,917
the same room in which the older brother jumped from and killed himself.

161
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,217
And at about the same time,

162
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:58,917
there is no queer story behind Toru Tendou's room,

163
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:02,517
but it is next to Yoji's room

164
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,517
and right above Rinko's room.

165
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:07,817
Which makes it the path that Rinko's dead spirit would walk through.

166
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,317
Maybe...

167
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,717
something may have possessed you three, too!

168
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:15,717
Yeah.

169
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:17,717
That's why we decided to stay here tonight

170
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,117
and head home first thing in the morning.

171
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:22,817
I've got to organize Rinko's things, too.

172
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:26,117
We brought a lot of things here with us.

173
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,817
It must be big sis!

174
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,917
Since she has come for us, shall we go home?

175
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,217
I guess so.

176
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,517
Hey, officer.

177
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,917
The fact is, just a while ago...

178
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,817
What is it? Is something wrong?

179
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,517
No, it's nothing.

180
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:48,917
That's right.

181
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,817
I'd like to have all your contact numbers,

182
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,417
so could you all wait in your rooms?

183
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,417
It'll only take a few minutes.

184
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,917
Yeah.

185
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,317
Sure.

186
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,717
That's no problem.

187
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,417
They're finally gone.

188
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,317
Shall we go get our stuff together then?

189
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:14,417
-Yeah. -I guess so.

190
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:18,117
I'll go clean up my room as well as Rinko's.

191
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,717
Are you sure you can handle it alone?

192
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,217
I'll help you with Rinko's room if you like.

193
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,717
Forget it.

194
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,917
Leave it up to Jun.

195
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,917
I'm sure Rinko has stuff that she doesn't want others to see.

196
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,417
That's right.

197
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:35,217
Okay, so let's hurry and clean up,

198
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:36,917
so we can head home first thing tomorrow morning.

199
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,217
Yeah.

200
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:09,322
So you've finally given yourself away.

201
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,022
Mr. Yoji Kuramoto!

202
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,022
Rather, I would like...

203
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:17,022
to address you as the man who killed Rinko!

204
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,722
Yoji, it was you after all.

205
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,222
You killed Rinko.

206
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,622
Hey, just what are you talking about?

207
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,622
Why would I do something like that?

208
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:30,922
How come you guys are in my room?

209
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,722
I'm sure I locked the door.

210
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:35,422
I opened it from inside.

211
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:37,722
What?

212
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,222
The officer told me to do so.

213
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,622
I pretended that I already went home,

214
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,922
but I was hiding in this room all this time.

215
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,422
I snuck into this room like you just did,

216
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:53,522
passing through the secret corridor from Rinko's room.

217
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:54,922
Secret corridor?

218
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:56,522
No use playing dumb!

219
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:59,522
We were watching from Rinko's room just now!

220
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:03,722
We watched you open the door behind the bookshelf

221
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:06,922
and rearranged the books before putting them back, right?

222
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:13,122
And we also watched you came out of that closet

223
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,122
from the peephole on that door.

224
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,822
In other words, I also know how you did it.

225
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,122
You told Rinko that you had something to talk to her about

226
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,722
and made her let you into her room.

227
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:27,922
Then you caught her off guard and strangled her to death.

228
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:29,322
You suspended her in mid air using a rope,

229
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:32,722
then locked the door and the windows to create a locked room.

230
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:35,922
You used the secret corridor that was used just now

231
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:38,722
and snuck back to your room

232
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:43,562
and made it look as if Rinko had committed suicide.

233
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:44,222
But your plan wasn't perfect.
and made it look as if Rinko had committed suicide.

234
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,363
But your plan wasn't perfect.

235
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,162
When you put the books back on the bookshelf,

236
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:50,062
which is the entrance to the secret corridor,

237
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:52,562
you made a mistake in lining the books up in sequential order.

238
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:57,221
You heard Conan mention the order of the books.

239
00:14:57,221 --> 00:15:01,521
You were afraid the police would find the secret passage,

240
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:05,521
so you decided to fix it while everyone was asleep.

241
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,921
Well, it's not surprising that you'd make a mistake.

242
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,921
Because you can't see the order from outside.

243
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,121
But it's amazing that you found out

244
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:18,021
about the secret corridor.

245
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,921
I found it easily.

246
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,121
Because...

247
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,321
Because?

248
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,121
Because, well...

249
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,721
Huh?

250
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:28,921
Let's see...

251
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,521
What was it?

252
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,021
I see. I get it, that's right.

253
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:40,521
When I saw the windows at this villa,

254
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,621
something suddenly hits me.

255
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,921
Unlike Rinko's room on the second floor,

256
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,921
or Yoji's room on the third floor

257
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:51,421
and Toru's room,

258
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:53,721
I noticed that only the maid's room with the sealed window

259
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,821
has narrow spaces between the windows.

260
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:01,021
And the distance between the side wall was short.

261
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:03,221
And when I heard Conan's casual remark

262
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:07,121
about the queer change in the bookshelf of Rinko's room,

263
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:09,121
I was convinced.

264
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:13,321
The window couldn't be opened not because it was nailed shut,

265
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:16,021
but because only half of it was nailed.

266
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:19,621
The left side of the window is inside of the secret passage,

267
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,121
which is why it can't be opened.

268
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,721
And a narrow corridor in the space made from this contraption

269
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,021
lead to the bookshelf in Rinko's room,

270
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:28,721
which was the doorway to this corridor.

271
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,621
To make the nailed window stand out less,

272
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:36,421
a bookshelf was put between the next two windows.

273
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:41,721
This way, no one would notice the amount of space between them.

274
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,521
If a wall partition is positioned on one side of the window,

275
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,721
a window that will open only half way could be made in the secret passage.

276
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,821
I see!

277
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:52,621
That's why when I saw someone looking out the window,

278
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:56,121
only the lower window on the left side was opened.

279
00:16:56,121 --> 00:17:00,121
But who built the secret passage and for what reason?

280
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,621
The one who made it was the owner of this house, the older brother.

281
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,921
The four rooms in question

282
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:11,421
have four windows each of the same size, facing the backyard.

283
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,321
If the room right below has a narrow window because of the secret passage,

284
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:19,721
it is because the entrance to the passage is directly above it.

285
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,521
The brother pretended he saw a devil,

286
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,021
so he could build this secret passage

287
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:27,021
and renovated the floor and walls of the villa.

288
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:30,821
Even if the room became a bit smaller, it was the maid's room,

289
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:34,621
so no one would complain about the room becoming smaller anyway.

290
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,121
Then why did he make it?

291
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:40,121
To watch and confirm

292
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:43,921
whether his wife and younger brother were having an affair.

293
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,321
According to Conan, there's a bird house in the backyard.

294
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:50,821
On the back of the bird house entrance, there's a slot to slide a plate in.

295
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,521
When the younger brother slide a plate in...

296
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,421
it was a sign telling his sister-in-law

297
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:59,221
to unlock the door of the room and wait for him.

298
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,721
But if his older brother looks into the bird house,

299
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,421
he would find out right away, wouldn't he?

300
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:05,921
If his younger brother and his wife sees that,

301
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:10,121
they would come up with another idea to signal each other, wouldn't they?

302
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,821
Moreover, that bird house could only be seen from the second floor

303
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:14,621
because the branches of the tree were in the way.

304
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:17,921
He couldn't look in from his wife's or the maid's room.

305
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:21,121
That's why the older brother made that secret passage.

306
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,921
He could confirm the signal when they wanted to see each other secretly,

307
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:28,521
as well as watch them having an affair from the passage.

308
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:33,021
Well, there's no way of knowing at this point already.

309
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:37,521
Let's say the older brother killed his wife and made it look like suicide.

310
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,321
Then unable to bear the feeling of guilt over what he had done,

311
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:42,621
he most likely committed suicide after killing his wife.

312
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,321
And Yoji who happened to find the secret passage

313
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,821
killed Rinko the same way the older brother killed his wife,

314
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,221
I see.

315
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:55,321
You didn't let me clean Rinko's room,

316
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,021
so that I would use the secret passage in the middle of the night

317
00:18:57,021 --> 00:19:01,121
to put the books that were out of sequence back in sequence again.

318
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:04,121
So both of you were working along with the police?

319
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,221
Yes.

320
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:09,221
The officer told us when he came to get our contact number.

321
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,521
He told us not to let you near Rinko's room.

322
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:18,721
And aren't you going to ask me why I killed her?

323
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:21,521
No. It's about the guitar, isn't it?

324
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:24,721
But didn't you settle it saying that you would go along with her?

325
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,221
Yeah.

326
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,521
I tried the best I could

327
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:32,221
and went over to Rinko's room to show her how much I tried.

328
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,521
But that woman...

329
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,721
No good at all. You're way off.

330
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,421
Haven't you been listening to the latest music?

331
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:42,921
Your guitar playing is out of date!

332
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:46,121
I'd advise you to start learning everything from scratch again.

333
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:51,421
Then she started degrading my favorite guitarist.

334
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:54,121
And when I realized that I couldn't hear her anymore...

335
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,621
Right in front of my eyes...

336
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,421
Right in front of my eyes, Rinko was...

337
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:03,121
Rinko was lying on the floor.

338
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:05,521
Then you weren't planning on killing her to begin with?

339
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:09,621
Wrong. I think I had the intention to kill her.

340
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:13,721
I didn't tell anybody that I found the secret passage

341
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,221
and was waiting for the chance to kill her one day.

342
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,721
I had the rope hidden at that time, too.

343
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:23,021
It's not like I was thinking of killing her at that time.

344
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,521
That's why I panicked and hung her from the chandelier near the door

345
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,221
and rushed to remove the key to that room from the key holder

346
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,621
and left through the secret passage.

347
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:34,021
To make sure no one saw me, I looked outside.

348
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:41,021
I ended up being seen by that boy wearing glasses.

349
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,221
Well...

350
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:48,421
Maybe it's me who was possessed by devil in this villa.

351
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,121
The rope that I used

352
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:52,321
was something I found on the floor of the secret passage.

353
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,521
It was probably the rope that was left

354
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,921
after the wealthy older brother killed his wife.

355
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:31,621
Please take him to the station.

356
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:32,621
Yes, sir!

357
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:41,621
What a fantastic deduction it was, officer.

358
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:44,321
I didn't know you had such hidden talent, Officer Yamamura.

359
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,721
Well, I wouldn't mind considering you my rival.

360
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:49,821
No, well...

361
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:52,021
The deduction I made were all thanks to Mr. Mouri...

362
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,321
P.S, P.S.

363
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,721
P.S.?

364
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:02,821
P.S.:

365
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:03,821
"I'd be embarrassed if people found out

366
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,821
that I was involved in such a rinky-dink case.

367
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,521
So don't tell anyone that you were getting help from me."

368
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,121
Kogoro Mouri.

369
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,621
Well, with a brain like mine,

370
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,621
a case like this is as sweet and easy to handle

371
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:21,821
as honey in sweet azuki beans dessert!

372
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:27,221
Shall we head on home then?

373
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,321
Let's go.

374
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:30,921
But to see through the case at the villa

375
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:33,521
just by hearing about it from you on the phone,

376
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,021
Detective Mouri is really something after all.

377
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:37,021
Yeah.

378
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,921
If he had to move in to the range of the service area of the cell phone

379
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,721
and e-mail me something like this,

380
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,021
he may as well have come here directly

381
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:48,021
and put on the Sleeping Kogoro show.

382
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,121
Yeah.

383
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:52,921
Actually I wanted to put either Sonoko or you to sleep.

384
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,321
But I couldn't.

385
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:58,821
Not in front of him.

386
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,500
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,500
"Fairy tale"

388
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,200
Too bad for Deduction Queen Sonoko...w
