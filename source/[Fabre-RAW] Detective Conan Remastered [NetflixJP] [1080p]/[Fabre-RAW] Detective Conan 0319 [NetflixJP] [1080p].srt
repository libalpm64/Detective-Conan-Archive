1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,440
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
One who is obviously the culprit.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,340
The vital point of truth pierces through the paradox.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,060
On our way back from Izu,

9
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,860
Pops car broke down again

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,060
on a mountain road covered with thick fog.

11
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,060
We stopped for help at a study facility

12
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,360
of the Kuron Health Equipment Corporation

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,460
that happened to be nearby.

14
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,160
In the presence of a tyrant president called Shiro Umetani,

15
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,260
everyone is in the midst of a company competition of massage chairs.

16
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,460
However,

17
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,660
Mr. Umetani is suddenly found stabbed with a knife.

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,560
Fortunately, Mr. Umetani's life is saved.

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,760
The culprit Hiramatsu flees with his car

20
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,260
and while fleeing, falls over a cliff and dies.

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,060
It seems that there was a thick fog at the time of the accident

22
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,960
and besides this slope is steep and the curve is very sharp.

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,460
It's most likely that he couldn't steer fast enough

24
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,860
while he was on the run.

25
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Yeah, most likely.

26
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,660
Strange.

27
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,760
There are too many strange things involved.

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,460
A person who gets enraged, stabs someone and flees,

29
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,660
flattens the tires of everyone's car

30
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,960
because he doesn't want anyone to come after him.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,260
This same person panics and steers his car out of control,

32
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,360
and falls over the cliff to his death.

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,560
The curve mirror that was facing the wrong way.

34
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,360
Brake oil that was completely gone.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,260
Something smells fishy.

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,860
Very fishy!

37
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,860
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 2)"

38
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Mr. Umetani,

39
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,160
at any rate, we'd better get you to a hospital quickly.

40
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,060
I'll ask you for details there.

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,560
No, I really can't be doing that.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,360
I've got to decide what to do

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,660
since something like this has happened.

44
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,360
A one-man management is really a lot of hassle

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,260
at times like this.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,760
Mr. Umetani?

47
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,160
I think it's better for you to go to the hospital after all.

48
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,260
This is really no big deal.

49
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,960
If I wasn't saved by this cigar case I had in my chest pocket,

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,260
I would've been in the world beyond by now.

51
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,760
If you think of it that way...

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,760
True.

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,260
It's indeed a cigar case of good luck.

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Oh, how terrible.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,060
The inside is wiped out.

56
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,360
That's a rare looking type of cigarette.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,360
Well, about 40, maybe...

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,660
Then, you must really have it tough without cigarettes.

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,260
You can have mine, if it's okay with you.

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,960
No, thanks.

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,060
I've got some more in my car.

63
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,660
Besides I only smoke cigars.

64
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,960
Would you like to try one, Mr. Mouri?

65
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
A cigar?

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,560
Mr. Mouri, I'd like to ask about the accident.

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,260
Oh, right.

68
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,160
I've got something good that may be of help.

69
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,060
Something good?

70
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,760
A video taped the competition we had.

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,860
What?

72
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,360
You video taped it?

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,760
Don't tell me that...

74
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Yes.

75
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,760
It shows what happened when Hiramatsu stabbed me.

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,360
Inspector Yokomizo!

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Inspector!

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,460
Please come upstairs for a moment!

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,260
-What is it? -The thing is...

80
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,160
We found this in the closet

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,660
between the mattresses in Mr. Hiramatsu's room.

82
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,760
A rope, stun gun and a death note.

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,160
A death note? What's going on?

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,460
What's this?

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,860
What's wrong?

86
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,160
What's this...

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,460
I've completely lost confidence in keeping this company going.

88
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,560
Please forgive me for my selfishness.

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,260
President of Kuron Health Equipment Corporation,

90
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,160
Shiro Umetani.

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
What?

92
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,060
It's President Umetani's death note!

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,060
Absurd!

94
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,060
I would never write something like this!

95
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
There's no reason why I should commit suicide!

96
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,960
Just as I thought.

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,260
Mr. Hiramatsu probably was scheming to kill you

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,260
using everything here.

99
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,760
How could he...

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,460
There's no doubt about it!

101
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,860
Before all else, let's take a look at the video tape!

102
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,260
I kept the video running just in case.

103
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,560
But, I sure had no idea

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,660
it would come in handy in a situation like this.

105
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,860
How ironic.

106
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,860
Oh, there!

107
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,060
After you all left the room, I tried AIMS out.

108
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,960
It was good, wasn't it?

109
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,460
Yes, I was definitely sure that it would be a hit.

110
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
Except for one problem.

111
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,060
Problem?

112
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,760
He demanded that I let him quit the company.

113
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,060
And that unless I take in his request,

114
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,360
he refused to give AIMS to me.

115
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,660
He said that unless the password is entered by midnight,

116
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,760
the program within AIMS would perish.

117
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,360
So, what did you do?

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
I was sure that I could make a great profit with AIMS.

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
But, I was more afraid of him going to another company

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,760
and developing something better than AIMS.

121
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,360
So, you chose Mr. Hiramatsu?

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,460
Yes.

123
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,660
At first, it seemed that he was convinced.

124
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,260
But he suddenly became enraged.

125
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,760
I was suddenly stabbed and fainted,

126
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,060
so I don't remember anything that followed.

127
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,360
I awoke when you people woke me up.

128
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,960
After that, Mr. Hiramatsu who afraid of

129
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,060
everybody finding out about what happened

130
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,060
fled from the window.

131
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,060
After he went through the trouble of preparing to kill you

132
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,860
under the pretense of suicide,

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,460
why would he lose his temper and use a knife because it was there?

134
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,460
That man had no patience.

135
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,660
He used to do only what he wanted to do.

136
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
He used to always wear a blank look and seemed like a quiet man,

137
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,460
yet he easily loses his temper.

138
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,660
You're pretty hard on him, aren't you?

139
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
How about you, Mr. Nakano?

140
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Well, it's true that he had that inclination.

141
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,060
I see.

142
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,460
This is the place that Mr. Hiramatsu's car was parked.

143
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,960
Just as I thought!

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,060
Brake oil leaked.

145
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,960
Somebody removed the tube!

146
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,760
Try it, will you?

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
The aroma is very different from cigarettes.

148
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,060
Come on, have one!

149
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,260
Thank you, I'll have one then.

150
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,260
But, what a fine cigar case you have!

151
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,660
Yes, it's my father's keepsake,

152
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,260
and this is a one and only.

153
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,560
Oh my God!

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,860
Well, well.

155
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,360
There's no mistake that this is Mr. Hiramatsu's briefcase.

156
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,260
Yes, there's no mistake about it.

157
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,460
It's just like Mr. Hiramatsu to hide it in the closet.

158
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,660
What do you mean?

159
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,360
He was very secretive.

160
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,860
The 3rd development room is a single room.

161
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,160
Therefore, the door was always locked,

162
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,960
and he wouldn't let anybody in.

163
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,760
The only time he ever talks is during the competition.

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,260
Then, did anyone know that he was planning to kill the president?

165
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,660
How would we ever know a thing like that?

166
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,260
Gosh, we're the ones who'd want to kill him!

167
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Huh?

168
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,560
Oh, well, I mean...

169
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,260
We understand very well his feeling of wanting to go independent!

170
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,460
Come to think of it, he was being yelled at even this morning.

171
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Only Mr. Hiramatsu's AIMS was delayed being brought here.

172
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,360
The president went to the 3rd development room himself

173
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,860
and Hiramatsu was being yelled at from morning.

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,060
After a while, Hiramatsu came dashing out

175
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,360
and disappeared off somewhere.

176
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
Talk about troublemaker.

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
But, we finally find him and come back

178
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,960
only to find the president gone next!

179
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,060
He tells us that he can't take it any longer

180
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,060
and had to cool down for a while.

181
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,160
Then, he goes out to buy that cheap cigar case.

182
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
What the heck's going on?

183
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,760
Didn't any of you go out with your car?

184
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,560
Great, Pops!

185
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah. We went to eat and do some shopping.

186
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,460
Of course, Hiramatsu didn't come with us.

187
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,960
The president said he was going to stop by at the villa,

188
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,460
so I went with Nakano in his car.

189
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,360
We arrived here right after that.

190
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,460
I see.

191
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,560
I get it!

192
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
I've figured everything out!

193
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,560
It's this late already.

194
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,660
Since I've more or less finished questioning all of you,

195
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,760
I guess we'll call it a day.

196
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,960
Mr. Mouri,

197
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,160
if your car's not repaired yet, let me give you a lift!

198
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,460
Oh, thanks.

199
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,760
It's been a long day.

200
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,760
I guess I'll go try out that relax seat one more time.

201
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Hey, dad!

202
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,460
It wasn't much of a case anyway.

203
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

204
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Ran!

205
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,160
Call Yokomizo and the others and tell them to come back!

206
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,860
Mr. Hiramatsu didn't die of an accident!

207
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,260
Huh?

208
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,560
This is a cleverly schemed homicide case!

209
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,840
What do you mean that Mr. Hiramatsu's death

210
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,340
by accident is a homicide case, Mr. Mouri?

211
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,740
Well, the brakes weren't working, but...

212
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,240
It's true that the malfunction of the brakes

213
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,740
do not always lead to fatal death.

214
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,140
However, the killer

215
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:32,140
set up another trap to make sure that he dies in the accident!

216
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,240
What kind of trick was it?

217
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Mr. Hiramatsu believed that he killed the president

218
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,940
and fled by car.

219
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,840
His brakes didn't work as he drove through the thick fog.

220
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,940
And, the car just kept going down the mountain.

221
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,140
Then suddenly the headlights of an oncoming car appear.

222
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,040
He loses control of the wheels and falls over the cliff.

223
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,340
Please wait, Mr. Mouri.

224
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,640
Was there an oncoming car?

225
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,440
The road uphill, all except for the private road

226
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,040
that's on the side here to this company lead up to the top

227
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,540
and is a dead end.

228
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,640
And besides, after sundown,

229
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,140
this whole area is covered with thick fog

230
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,940
that there is always practically no one.

231
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,140
There doesn't seem to have been such a car.

232
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,840
No, wrong.

233
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,340
The lights he thought were of an oncoming car was...

234
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,840
the headlights of his own car.

235
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,040
But unless there's a mirror or something in front...

236
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,840
Yes, do you remember that

237
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
there was something at the scene of the accident

238
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,040
that was reflecting the floodlight?

239
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,940
Yes! Yes!

240
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,840
The corner mirror that was on the road leading to this facility!

241
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
I see.

242
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,840
The angle of the corner mirror was changed

243
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,840
to reflect the headlights!

244
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,340
When Officer Shimada of the residential police box saw in the day time,

245
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,040
it seemed to be in the correct position.

246
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,240
And in the parking lot where Mr. Hiramatsu's car was parked,

247
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,140
there were traces of oil leak.

248
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,740
The person who removed the brake oil

249
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,340
and the person who flattened the tires of the other cars

250
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,840
is probably one and the same.

251
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
Even if the brakes were to be tampered with,

252
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,740
there's no guarantee that Mr. Hiramatsu would flee with that car.

253
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Besides, if someone goes after Mr. Hiramatsu

254
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,340
and catches him before he gets into the accident,

255
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,940
everything will go to waste!

256
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,440
Which means, Mr. Mouri...

257
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,640
someone here did it?

258
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,440
Here, you mean us?

259
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,840
-No! -We don't have time long enough to be alone,

260
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,040
so it's impossible!

261
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
Only the president has time to himself, right?

262
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,540
You idiot! I'm the victim!

263
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,740
Mr. Umetani, after the competition,

264
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,540
you went to take a smoke of cigar all by yourself.

265
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,040
And, you seem to have come home alone

266
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,740
when everyone went out to have dinner, didn't you?

267
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,040
You went by the corner mirror with your car then, didn't you?

268
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,140
Hey, hold it!

269
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,640
Have you forgotten that I've extended my kindness to you?

270
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
One more thing.

271
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,940
The killer used a certain thing.

272
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,540
Just what is that certain thing?

273
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,240
The other thing is...

274
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,240
The other thing is...

275
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,740
The fog.

276
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,040
The fog?

277
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,840
Yes, the thick fog that is unique to this area.

278
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Without the fog,

279
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,840
it'd be easy to see through the corner mirror trick.

280
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,540
In other words, the one thing that was necessary

281
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,140
to commit this murder was the fog.

282
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,040
And the only person who could use this fog to his advantage was you!

283
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,740
President Umetani!

284
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,240
None other than you!

285
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,440
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
The fog is a natural phenomenon!

287
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,040
Besides, the fact that Hiramatsu would stab me and flee

288
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,940
is not something I could've known beforehand!

289
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,640
How dare you say something irresponsible like that?

290
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,940
No, you knew

291
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,440
that Mr. Hiramatsu was planning to kill you.

292
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,140
What?

293
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,340
I hear that you had it out with Mr. Hiramatsu before coming here

294
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,640
and Mr. Hiramatsu dashed out of the room.

295
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,740
You stayed back in the room

296
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,840
so I guess you saw it, didn't you?

297
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,940
The inside of the briefcase!

298
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,440
Therefore, thinking of getting back at him,

299
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,840
you went to buy yourself a cigar case just before leaving.

300
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,140
Because the one that you're always using

301
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,940
is a precious keepsake of your father.

302
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,540
Well, using all kinds of cigar cases is good for a change!

303
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,140
Then why would a person like you who smokes 40 cigars a day

304
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:14,140
choose a cigar case that can take only 4 or 5 cigars placed diagonally?

305
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,840
And...

306
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,640
you kept postponing the competition for one reason or another

307
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,840
till the night when a thick fog appeared.

308
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
In other words,

309
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,340
this homicide taking advantage of and envisioning this fog

310
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,440
can only have been committed by you, the one-man president!

311
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,940
Some renown detective you are.

312
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,740
All you said just now are nothing but assumptions!

313
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,640
Where the heck is the evidence?

314
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,540
The evidence is on the video tape.

315
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Please look closely at Mr. Hiramatsu's facial expression.

316
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
When Mr. Hiramatsu

317
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,240
demanded you to make a choice between AIMS and him,

318
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,440
you selected Mr. Hiramatsu to AIMS, didn't you, Mr. Umetani?

319
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
Yeah, right!

320
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,440
Oh, stop right there!

321
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,640
If so, why would Mr. Hiramatsu

322
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,940
who couldn't get what he wanted be smiling?

323
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,340
Beats me.

324
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,540
Isn't it a fact that you agreed to what he asked for?

325
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,940
Please move it on now.

326
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,940
And, he's saying something to you, isn't he?

327
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,840
I'm sure he's giving you the password.

328
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,040
The password to stop the program of AIMS from being erased.

329
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,840
However, he is suddenly angered

330
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,640
and stabs you in the shoulder.

331
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,040
It's most likely that

332
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,740
he realized that you just pretended to take in his demand.

333
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,040
Hey, cut it out already!

334
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,940
You just made up your story

335
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,640
so that it looks to fit what's seen on the video tape!

336
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
Is this what you call evidence?

337
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,940
No, this video shows one more thing

338
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,340
that is not in keeping with what you're saying.

339
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Not in keeping?

340
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,140
Please advance the tape.

341
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,840
Stop!

343
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,140
I thought you said that you passed out at this point,

344
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,240
but why does Mr. Hiramatsu

345
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,540
stop in place as if someone is calling him?

346
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,740
How should I know?

347
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,540
Isn't this what you said when you called out to him?

348
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,640
Come back!

349
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,040
If you don't finish me off,

350
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,140
it's going to be your turn next time around!

351
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,940
Or something to that effect.

352
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,140
You probably went on like this.

353
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,740
If you stab the "O" of Kuron, you'll finish me for sure!

354
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,640
Because it's right on the heart!

355
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,740
Mr. Hiramatsu did exactly as you provoked him to

356
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,640
and stabbed right through the letter, "O".

357
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,240
On the letter "O" right, on top the cigar case

358
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,140
that you had put inside your chest pocket!

359
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,640
What a bunch of baloney!

360
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,340
It's all just your imagination!

361
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,840
No thing like this is going to serve as evidence!

362
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,240
Inspector Yokomizo.

363
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,840
-Yes, sir? -What time is it now?

364
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,540
One minute before midnight.

365
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,740
Mr. Umetani.

366
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,240
Will you turn on the switch for AIMS after midnight?

367
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,840
If you didn't get the password from him as you say,

368
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,640
the device is not supposed to work, is it?

369
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,940
Mr. Umetani?

370
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,240
It's midnight.

371
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,240
Good evening, President Umetani.

372
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,040
I appreciate our wise choice.

373
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,540
Please make a lot of profit with my AIMS.

374
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,340
I guess we'll never be seeing each other ever again.

375
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,140
Goodbye, President Umetani.

376
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,140
Darn.

377
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,840
Good job, Conan! More towards the shoulders!

378
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,740
It feels like I'm being deliberately stepped on.

379
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,840
Pops, you're right!

380
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,140
Let's buy a massage chair after all!

381
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,040
If you want to buy something expensive like that,

382
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,740
do work that will bring in enough cash, okay?

383
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,940
But don't you feel sorry that Conan has to do all this hard work?

384
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,840
So, I'll massage you, then.

385
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,940
No thanks!

386
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,440
No, don't do this to me!

387
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,940
I'll cure you by putting your backbone in place.

388
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,740
I promise it'll make you feel way better.

389
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,540
I don't need anymore massage today.

390
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,140
I'm going to get delicious food ready, then.

391
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,340
Talk about scary.

392
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,020
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,020
"Answerphone"

394
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,540
The next episode is a unique mystery.

395
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,980
It's show time for me again.

396
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,060
Is that a voicemail from answerphone?
