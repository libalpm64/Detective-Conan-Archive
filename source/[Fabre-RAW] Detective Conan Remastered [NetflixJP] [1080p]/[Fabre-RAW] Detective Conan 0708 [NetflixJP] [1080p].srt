1
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:07,987
On Sunday, right after summer vacation...

2
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:14,013
it was after we went to watch a movie with Dr. Agasa.

3
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,013
It's 2:00 pm sharp!

4
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:22,013
I just saw the clock strike 2:00 pm.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,513
Yes, yes, how lucky of you.

6
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:26,813
Genta, your voice is too loud.

7
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:31,613
Hey, look at that! On top of the building!

8
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,813
What is it now?

9
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:37,113
Could they be fighting?

10
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,613
What a dangerous thing to do in a place like that.

11
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,023
He's been pushed off!

12
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,013
Aim for a 100% solution.

13
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:09,613
Clear all mysteries and codes.

14
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,713
Falling slowly, a strange phenomenon.

15
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:14,053
An unthinkable mystery that moves time.

16
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,413
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:17,313
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:19,413
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,739
"The Man Who Fell Slowly".

20
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,175
Excuse me.

21
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,539
Is the person who reported this is here?

22
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,739
Yes, it's me.

23
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,939
I happened to pass by here, on my way back from shopping.

24
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,201
That's why I called 911 right away.

25
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,839
I see.

26
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,739
That's strange.

27
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,739
Hey, sir!

28
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,209
He didn't commit suicide.

29
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,539
It's not an accident either.

30
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,213
Somebody pushed him off the roof.

31
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,739
What?

32
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,219
I'm Sakai, a paramedic from Beika.

33
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,139
About the fall accident I reported just a while ago,

34
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,225
there's a possibility of it being an attempted murder.

35
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,639
Yes.

36
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,539
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, age 37.

37
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,239
He resides in Central Beika City.

38
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,939
Miss.

39
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,839
You called the ambulance

40
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,639
at about 2:10, right?

41
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,939
Yes, at 2:10 sharp.

42
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,539
It's only been five to six minutes since the ambulance got here, right?

43
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,339
And right now, it just about 2:20 pm.

44
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,439
The estimated time it takes for the ambulance

45
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,539
to arrive at the scene is about five to six minutes.

46
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,139
The approximate time of the call was made

47
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,261
can be calculated by subtraction.

48
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,263
I see.

49
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,839
Wait.

50
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,639
We saw the man being pushed off...

51
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,639
That's right.

52
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,539
At 2:00 pm sharp.

53
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,539
Yeah.

54
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,275
In other words, it was a long fall that took 10 minutes to hit the ground.

55
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,139
And this building is only five stories tall.

56
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,281
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

57
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,639
Was this building that low?

58
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,839
No. It looked at least five stories tall.

59
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,639
-Hey. -Wait.

60
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,839
Hey, wait. There's an elevator.

61
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,739
But look at it.

62
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,839
"Out of order" -It's out of order.

63
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,139
He must've fallen right around down here.

64
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,839
I see, so that's how it is.

65
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,539
The first two floors are protruded

66
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,317
and there is a veranda on the third floor.

67
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,239
I see.

68
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,639
The man who was pushed off from here,

69
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,323
fell onto that veranda.

70
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,539
Then, he fell from there to the ground.

71
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,329
That's why it took 10 minutes.

72
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,239
Poor thing that he had to fall twice.

73
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,839
Anyway, let's go search inside the building.

74
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,739
According to the lady a while ago,

75
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:00,839
nobody came out of this building.

76
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,439
More than 10 minutes have passed already.

77
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,439
Maybe the culprit got away from the backdoor.

78
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,345
Backdoor!

79
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,939
A clue to the culprit maybe left there.

80
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,239
I'll go over that way!

81
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,351
-Okay! -Okay!

82
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,353
Hey, you guys!

83
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:18,357
In that case, we'll go check out that veranda.

84
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,361
From that location, it's this room you'll end up with.

85
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,639
"Ogata Finance" -Ogata Finance?

86
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,365
If I'm not mistaken, the victim was...

87
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,739
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, age 37.

88
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:33,039
Maybe this is his office.

89
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,339
A money lender?

90
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,339
Hey, Shinichi.

91
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,139
So, this is where the crime took place.

92
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,139
What?

93
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,385
"Out of order" -What?

94
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,739
After we found the backdoor...

95
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,439
It's chain locked, which means...

96
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,839
The culprit didn't flee from this backdoor.

97
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,839
If so, than where on earth did he escaped?

98
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,039
It seems that they were fighting.

99
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,439
I don't think it's good to go inside on your own.

100
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,839
A driver's license?

101
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,413
Ryohei Honda.

102
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,339
Since this is on the sofa that's toppled,

103
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,939
one the victim was struggling with must've been him.

104
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,139
Maybe he's the culprit.

105
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,423
We don't know that yet.

106
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,739
Hey, you guys.

107
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:31,939
The emergency stairs.

108
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:32,939
I'm sure that the culprit

109
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,739
ran down to the emergency stairs from the third floor and fled.

110
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:39,239
It's muddy here.

111
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,239
There are no footprints or what so ever here.

112
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,639
That can't be.

113
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,445
If the culprit neither used the front door nor the backdoor,

114
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,939
or even the emergency stairs,

115
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,339
where on earth did the culprit flee from?

116
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,453
No, there could be no other way.

117
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:55,539
Which means

118
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,839
the culprit is still inside this building.

119
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,239
He's hiding!

120
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,139
Then, I'll call Conan.

121
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,139
No.

122
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,639
Mitsuhiko?

123
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,139
Are you saying that we're looking for

124
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,739
the culprit who's hiding on our own?

125
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,039
-This is... -Yes. Drag marks.

126
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,539
And blood stains, too.

127
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,139
It seems that the culprit

128
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,239
dragged the victim who fell from the roof into the room once.

129
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:25,539
And then pushed him off again from here.

130
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,039
Glasses.

131
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,439
It resembles the one that the owner of the driver's license,

132
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,039
Honda was wearing.

133
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,139
It was found outside on the veranda, which means

134
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,739
as he was pushed off the roof,

135
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:42,239
the victim Mr. Ogata tore it off from the culprit.

136
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,739
If those glasses are unmistakably belong to the man called Honda,

137
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,539
then we've got the culprit already.

138
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,339
I guess there's nothing for us to do.

139
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:51,839
But if the culprit was planning to push him off again,

140
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,739
why did he drag Mr. Ogata back into the room?

141
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:00,039
For what?

142
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:08,239
Are you the ones who witnessed Masaaki Ogata being pushed off?

143
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,039
But you shouldn't be in here on your own.

144
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,239
Not whilst accompanied by Mr. Agasa.

145
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,939
I'm very sorry.

146
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:17,339
Since you're here from headquarters,

147
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,239
it goes to show that Mr. Ogata is no ordinary citizen, right?

148
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:23,039
He's a notorious loan shark.

149
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,139
Chiba!

150
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,547
There are glasses outside on the veranda.

151
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,239
And this, too.

152
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,939
A driver's license?

153
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,839
Ryohei Honda?

154
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,139
Ryohei Honda...

155
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,439
It seems that these glasses are his too.

156
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,561
Yeah.

157
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:46,939
There seems to be no doubt that he came here and had it out with Ogata.

158
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:49,439
We'll have the district police to check it out for now.

159
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,569
Okay.

160
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,839
Okay, I'll go check the roof, then.

161
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,039
Okay.

162
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,239
I think it's better to tell the police

163
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,339
that the culprit is still inside this building

164
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,239
rather than look for him ourselves.

165
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,639
Let's do all that we can on our own first.

166
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,039
Mitsuhiko.

167
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,139
I'm vexed at myself!

168
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:15,639
Only if we'd have been more observant,

169
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,597
maybe we could've identified the culprit.

170
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,939
Mitsuhiko.

171
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,239
Okay.

172
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,339
I'll go search upstairs.

173
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,539
I'll go to the basement.

174
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,039
Launch search!

175
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,239
"Ogata Finance"

176
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,439
Yes, this is Takagi.

177
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,039
What? The whereabouts of Ryohei Honda is unknown?

178
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,039
Okay. I got it. Good work.

179
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,739
It seems that he went out without telling anyone where he was going

180
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:47,039
and hasn't returned home after leaving his residence after noon.

181
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,839
He seems to have run into his old acquaintance yesterday

182
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,039
and went out to see that person.

183
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,635
That's the report we got. It seems conclusive already.

184
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,439
But it still bothers me.

185
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,439
Why was the body dragged back into the room?

186
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,939
Oh, no.

187
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,139
"Komehana Boots Shop" -Boots?

188
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,039
Nothing strange about it, right?

189
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,439
It's raining.

190
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,939
But this receipt is last night's.

191
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,657
The weather forecast yesterday said that it would be a fine day today.

192
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,661
"Ogata Finance"

193
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,739
He's not here in this room either.

194
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,669
He wasn't hiding anywhere upstairs!

195
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,639
That was really fast. Did you really check carefully?

196
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,673
For sure.

197
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:37,739
You guys.

198
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,939
What was that scream just now?

199
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,239
It's Ayumi!

200
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,239
She said she was going to check the basement.

201
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,683
Hey, Ayumi!

202
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,439
Ayumi.

203
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,687
Ayumi, are you all right?

204
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,339
Ms. Yoshida!

205
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:52,691
Are you okay? Ayumi!

206
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,539
A mouse...

207
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,699
I'm glad you weren't bitten.

208
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,339
Rather, thank God you weren't caught by the culprit.

209
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,639
Yeah.

210
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,139
There's no chance that Honda would still be here.

211
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,139
Who's Honda?

212
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:12,439
-You've already know who the culprit is? -You know about the culprit?

213
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,739
Well, no.

214
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:16,239
There's only one car,

215
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,439
so does that mean it belongs to that man?

216
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,139
Is something matter?

217
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,439
-Boots? -Yeah.

218
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,725
Together with something else that's bothering me.

219
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,727
A shovel?

220
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,739
The way these two things would be utilized is...

221
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,939
It's pretty limited.

222
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:37,239
"Out of order" -No clue on the roof.

223
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,039
Is there anyone here?

224
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,839
This is the police.

225
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,139
If anyone is here, please answer me.

226
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,439
Who is Honda?

227
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,439
You know him too, don't you?

228
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,839
So, nothing's conclusive yet.

229
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,239
Yes, Takagi here.

230
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:10,139
Oh, it's you, Chiba.

231
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,539
Caught? Who is it?

232
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,739
Me. I was caught by the culprit.

233
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,539
What? The culprit?

234
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,284
I didn't ask you to come.

235
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:30,284
I just asked for a get-away car.

236
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:33,684
It was you after all, Honda?

237
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:35,784
So he's the guy called Honda.

238
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:39,084
The culprit was still inside this building after all.

239
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,799
-Yes. -Right.

240
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,084
Why'd he do something like this?

241
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,784
Why'd you do it, Honda?

242
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:49,184
Why'd you kill Ogata?

243
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:50,809
Who are you?

244
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,811
Did you forget me?

245
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,284
I don't remember anything!

246
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:58,817
It seems he's got amnesia.

247
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,484
Amnesia?

248
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:03,584
That's why he did this.

249
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,584
Honda, listen to me.

250
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:08,827
You're not the type of person that do something like this.

251
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:12,184
I arrested you eight years ago

252
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,184
for alleged robbery.

253
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,484
I committed a robbery?

254
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:17,584
Yeah.

255
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:21,784
With a guy you happened to run into at a pub.

256
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:25,484
But the only clue that we had was that your accomplice had a hoarse voice

257
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:27,784
and that wasn't enough to nab him,

258
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,284
so you ended up serving time alone.

259
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:32,851
But after completing your sentence,

260
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,853
you changed into a fine man!

261
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,584
Not only that.

262
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,184
After taking your father's small factory,

263
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:43,884
you took in people who had criminal records like you as factory workers

264
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,184
and supported them.

265
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:48,867
I did something like that?

266
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,869
He's a very good man.

267
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,871
-Yes. -Yeah.

268
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:56,584
Why would somebody like you go back to commit another crime?

269
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:58,884
What's your connection with Ogata?

270
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:00,879
Yes, a connection.

271
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,881
Between this man and the victim.

272
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,484
Come to think of it, a while ago...

273
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:09,384
He seems to have run into old acquaintance yesterday

274
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:13,684
and went out to see that person.

275
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:15,684
If that's case...

276
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:28,484
I got it. So, that's how it was.

277
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:32,184
Honda, what went on between you and Ogata?

278
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,284
I've been trying to tell you.

279
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,584
I don't know what on earth is going on.

280
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,284
Where am I?

281
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:50,684
It seems that I had it out with someone over there.

282
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:59,484
I... I pushed him down from here?

283
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:02,484
I was afraid of getting caught.

284
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:05,984
But I had a headache and felt faint.

285
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,184
I figured out that I should hide myself.

286
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:13,584
When I finally thought that I could somehow manage to move...

287
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:20,284
"Out of order" -No clue on the roof.

288
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,184
Is there anyone here?

289
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,784
This is the police.

290
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,284
Police?

291
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,384
I didn't want to get caught.

292
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:33,584
But why did I try to kill him to begin with?

293
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,384
If he doesn't know,

294
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:38,084
there's no way anyone else would know.

295
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:41,384
So, there's no other way than for a detective to solve it for him.

296
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:46,284
Why did I try to kill that man?

297
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:47,984
You're wrong, Mr. Honda.

298
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:51,984
Didn't you come to visit Masaaki Ogata

299
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:54,784
because he was an old acquaintance of yours?

300
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:56,995
Old acquaintance?

301
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,184
Officer Takagi,

302
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,584
I think that Masaaki Ogata had a hoarse voice.

303
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,784
Yes, a very gruff one.

304
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:07,484
Can't you remember, Mr. Honda?

305
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,007
It's the man with a hoarse voice.

306
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:13,011
You became acquainted with that man eight years ago at a pub.

307
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,284
It couldn't be.

308
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,984
Eight years ago,

309
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:20,084
a man with a hoarse voice.

310
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:22,584
I got to know him at a pub.

311
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,184
A man with a hoarse voice...

312
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:27,784
It's him!

313
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,984
He looked completely different,

314
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:31,984
but his voice...

315
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:37,784
I'll collect the money from you even I have to go to hell!

316
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,784
You get that?

317
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,584
What's with you?

318
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:47,484
It's you after all.

319
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:52,584
It's true it's been eight years ago,

320
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:55,053
but the statute of limitations hasn't run out yet.

321
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,055
So you're telling me to turn myself in?

322
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,584
If you pay for your sins,

323
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,084
you can live your life under the sun

324
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,784
without feeling guilty towards anyone, right?

325
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,284
I was somehow trying to get him to turn himself in.

326
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,384
He's a good person after all, isn't he?

327
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,384
But...

328
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,073
That good man ended up...

329
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,384
So how'd you end up killing Ogata, then?

330
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:20,484
I don't remember that part.

331
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,684
It's the other way around.

332
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,484
Since you knew the wrongdoings of the past,

333
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:28,784
Masaaki Ogata tried to get rid of you.

334
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:29,984
After killing you,

335
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,284
he was probably planning to take your body to the remote mountains

336
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,884
to bury and hide it.

337
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:35,484
After making preparations to do so,

338
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:37,784
he called you over to come to your office that was empty

339
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,384
because it was a holiday.

340
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,884
Ogata carried out his scheme.

341
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,784
But he failed to kill you.

342
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,784
So he ended up pushing you off the roof.

343
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,115
Which means that when we saw it...

344
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:59,117
The one who was pushed down...

345
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:00,684
Was Mr. Honda?

346
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:05,584
Then Mr. Honda, who Ogata was ready to finish off

347
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,084
was dragged back into the office.

348
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:12,384
As proof of this... See? His jacket is soiled.

349
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,684
But the one who fell to the ground

350
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,784
was the one called Ogata.

351
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,184
Exactly.

352
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:19,784
However back then,

353
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,884
Mr. Honda had incurred a severe blow to his head

354
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:25,684
that was bad enough to cause amnesia and passed out.

355
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:27,984
So he couldn't have pushed Masaaki Ogata down.

356
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:31,149
If so, there's only one plausible explanation.

357
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,084
Masaaki Ogata, after finishing his target off,

358
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:38,084
was scheming to bury and hide him as planned.

359
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,157
In order to do so,

360
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:43,161
he had to hide traces of Mr. Honda coming over.

361
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:50,684
I've got to get rid of that too.

362
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:52,684
Where's his glasses?

363
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:53,984
Are they here?

364
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:58,584
There it is.

365
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:02,384
However, he was leaning on a really slippery surface.

366
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,884
Back then... Remember?

367
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:17,195
In other words, it was not that one person was pushed off twice,

368
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,684
but two people switched places partway

369
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:23,684
in a matter of 10 minutes.

370
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:27,684
So that's the truth behind the long fall.

371
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,784
What a bummer.

372
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,584
Honda.

373
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:43,584
It may be true that you did nothing

374
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:46,384
as far as Masaaki Ogata is concerned.

375
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:49,784
But you attacked and went as far as to confine Officer Chiba.

376
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,229
But Inspector...

377
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,984
That's a fact.

378
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,984
Inspector.

379
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:56,984
You'll have to come with me.

380
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,084
Yes, sir.

381
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,984
I feel sorry for him.

382
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:02,084
-Yeah. -Yeah.

383
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,241
Conan.

384
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:07,245
There's nothing I can do about it.

385
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,084
He may have panicked after losing his memory,

386
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:12,784
but he did what he did and that's fact.

387
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:14,384
Besides,

388
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:17,984
I think he understands more than anyone else does.

389
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,884
I'm sorry for troubling you.

390
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:22,284
Not at all.

391
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,263
Never mind the handcuffs.

392
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,884
I'm asking him to come along voluntarily.

393
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:30,284
But before that, let's take you to the hospital.

394
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:34,284
Let's have them treat your head wound, Mr. Honda.

395
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,684
Masaaki Ogata was arrested

396
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:38,684
under charges of the robbery that was committed eight years ago,

397
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:42,684
as well as the attempted murder against Mr. Honda soon after the incident.

398
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:45,084
Both of the charges were dropped shortly.

399
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:11,369
Dr. Agasa, you really did a good job again this time too, didn't you?

400
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,371
-For sure. -Yes.

401
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:15,373
Well, I guess so.

402
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:18,884
A rainbow.

403
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,984
-Splendid. -It's pretty!

404
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:26,384
I knew that things would turn out this way to begin with.

405
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:28,684
That the incident would start at 2:00,

406
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:29,984
that is, it would start out like the movie "The Double Hour"

407
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:32,684
but end up happily like when one views a double rainbow.

408
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,484
Another one of his puns.

409
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,384
I went out of my way to compliment him.

410
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:37,984
All down the drain.

411
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,984
Another punch line with a long decent.

412
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,784
What a far-fetched analogy.

413
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:44,484
It's like always.

414
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,900
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:50,720
"Cable tie".

416
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:52,780
-A guitar. -A bass.

417
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,270
-And drums. -Who's the vocalist?

418
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,413
No band here.
