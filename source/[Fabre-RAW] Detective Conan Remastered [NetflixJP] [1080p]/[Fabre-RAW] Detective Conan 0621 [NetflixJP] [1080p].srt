1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,639
Wimbledon in the rain.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,539
The roof has closed over the Center Court.

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,639
The game will resume.

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,993
The score is 6-6 and it is a tie-break.

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,639
Serve begins with Baur that has won the 1st set.

6
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,005
The queen appears again.

7
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,439
Struggle with all your might

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,439
in order to keep your mother alive as long as possible.

9
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,439
If I lose this tie-break,

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,239
mother will...

11
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,339
Come on, Minerva!

12
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,339
Don't give up the fight!

13
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:53,839
Even though she has a championship point!

14
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,539
Hang in there, win the match!

15
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,539
Hang in?

16
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,739
Grass Court Queen.

17
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,439
Can you do it?

18
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:06,939
Okay!

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,839
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

20
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,051
You must be true to yourself.

21
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,053
An exchange rally, of life at stake.

22
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,539
The unexpected two and the two whose excitement heightens.

23
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,057
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,059
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,061
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,599
An eerie coded note was what was waiting for us in London.

27
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,169
It was the forewarning of a killing by Hades Sabara,

28
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,199
a vicious criminal on the run.

29
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,499
We deciphered the code and figured out

30
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:19,699
that Hades was after the life of contestant Minerva Grass,

31
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,899
who was competing in the Ladies' Singles Finals

32
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:24,199
at the Wimbledon Center.

33
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:28,799
But thanks to the Braille messages

34
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,899
that Minerva sent by landing the balls

35
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,699
that she served at certain points on the court,

36
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,699
we further found out that Hades was not after Minerva,

37
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,799
but rather after her mother Juno

38
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,099
who was in the stands cheering for her.

39
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,299
Hades will push the switch to set off the bomb

40
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,199
as soon as the game ends.

41
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,699
We've got to find him before he does so!

42
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,099
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (0 is Start)"

43
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,899
Play!

44
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,999
Just as would be expected of an apprentice of Holmes.

45
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,199
You've thought it out, haven't you?

46
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,499
But it sure is a high risk demand.

47
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,699
After all my opponent's a powerful server

48
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,999
who ranks number 2 in the world

49
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,999
that possesses serves that exceed 120 MPH...

50
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,799
Demeter Baur!

51
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,099
Yes!

52
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,255
1-0, Ms. Bauer!

53
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:41,299
But, if that's going to help nab the culprit...

54
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,263
If I can save mother...

55
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,999
I'll show you

56
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:49,299
what this Grass Court Queen Minerva Grass...

57
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,999
can really do!

58
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,275
1 all!

59
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,999
Amazing! She returned a service Ace.

60
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,283
But how do you settle a tie-break, anyway?

61
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:08,999
The one scores 7 points first will win this set.

62
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,899
But, if the score is 6-6,

63
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:14,599
the game continues until there is a difference of 2 points.

64
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,599
So, if the Grass Court Queen is lead by two points...

65
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,199
My sister who lost the 1st set will lose,

66
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
and the game ends.

67
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,899
If that happens, the guy called Hades

68
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,899
will set off the bomb that mother is carrying, right?

69
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,299
Out!

70
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,499
7-6, Ms. Bauer!

71
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,799
Hey, she's being lead by a score of 7-6, which means...

72
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,599
The opponent has the championship point!

73
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,299
If the opponent scores next, Minerva will lose.

74
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:52,599
Sis...

75
00:05:56,335 --> 00:06:00,599
So, you're at the end of your rope, Grass Court Queen.

76
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,341
As soon as the game ends,

77
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,199
I'm pushing the switch and blowing your mother up.

78
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,799
And, as I wrote in the memo that was inserted into your wristband,

79
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:14,099
I'll give you the image of that moment

80
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,599
when your mother blows up to pieces.

81
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,363
You, who lost miserably at last year's All French Open

82
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,599
leaving my mother to die...

83
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,369
Then, a month after that, on the funeral day of mother,

84
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,371
you won an overwhelming victory,

85
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,599
and raised the trophy high and proud in the air.

86
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,699
In order to make you taste

87
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,999
the anger and sadness I felt back then too!

88
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,899
So, little apprentice of Holmes.

89
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,385
I've given the championship point

90
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,899
to the opponent just as you wanted me, too.

91
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,199
I found mother with the high lob ball I just shot.

92
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:03,899
So, now you do your part and find him, all right? The culprit.

93
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,799
And live up to your name as the apprentice of Holmes!

94
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,299
First the center, slightly weakly...

95
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,899
She'll shoot back with forehand.

96
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,399
She'll return the ball to my back side.

97
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,419
I'll slice return with a strong backhand slice.

98
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,699
At the caliber you're playing today, you can easily...

99
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,423
return the ball, can't you?

100
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,431
What a fantastic rally.

101
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,699
It's been going on for over 10 minutes already!

102
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,435
Hang in there, Minerva!

103
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,199
Frame shot!

104
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,799
It's big! Out!

105
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,443
I'll volley then, before it outs!

106
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,099
Shoots, it's shallow!

107
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,899
It'll come out at the net!

108
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,399
It's a chance ball for the opponent!

109
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,799
Finish!

110
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,799
Back court left side.

111
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,299
Just on line!

112
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,467
It's in!

113
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,599
Okay. Now, we're starting over!

114
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,999
But what a long rally.

115
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,499
I think they've been at it over 30 times already?

116
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,999
Don't tell me that Minerva

117
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,499
is deliberately continuing to rally?

118
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,485
She returned the ball that was about to out with a volley, too.

119
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,489
But, what is she continuing for?

120
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,999
So, Hades, where are you?

121
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,699
Where are you?

122
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:47,499
Show yourself, Hades!

123
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,499
Cord ball!

124
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:57,799
Reach!

125
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,199
Please!

126
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,699
No!

127
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,499
She couldn't reach it.

128
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,999
Then, don't tell me that...

129
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,535
Sis lost...

130
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,999
Game set, and match won by...

131
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,799
Challenge!

132
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,547
What's that? Challenge?

133
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,549
The challenge system.

134
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,299
If discontented with the referee's judgment of where the ball dropped,

135
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,553
you can reconfirm the place

136
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,099
where the ball fell, 3 times to a set!

137
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,559
This done by using Hawk Eye, that is,

138
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,999
10 devices that replay the recorded data by CG images!

139
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,499
So, I'm sure that Minerva's going

140
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,569
to insist that the ball just now was out!

141
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:54,299
A poor loser queen.

142
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:57,599
Begging for life before the guillotine?

143
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,099
But the judgment's not going to turn over.

144
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,199
And right after the cheers of joy,

145
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,799
the silent interval during the sound of the blast and screams

146
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,599
will be a requiem in tribute to your mother.

147
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,399
It's out!

148
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,399
Her challenge succeeded!

149
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,299
Which means it's a tie of 7-7!

150
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,499
I somehow managed to get by.

151
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,499
But I can't go on rallying anymore.

152
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,099
But...

153
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,899
It seems from the look on your face, that you found him.

154
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,467
She did it!

155
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:00,639
She caught up!

156
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,367
Next, it's the final set.

157
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,467
No matter which side wins, if the game ends,

158
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,267
Hades will set the bomb off.

159
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,967
No need to worry! I just got mail from Holmes' apprentice

160
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,651
that he found the culprit.

161
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,067
So, I'm sure he's off to nab the culprit already.

162
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,655
-Huh? -Huh?

163
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,467
Please let me in!

164
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,567
Like I've been telling you,

165
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,467
this is the wrong place for your ticket.

166
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,567
I must see someone before the game's over!

167
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,669
I will come back right away! Please!

168
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,067
You might need this.

169
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,167
When this boy ran into me,

170
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,567
we happened to exchange our tickets.

171
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,267
Well, you can enter here, then.

172
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:47,367
I'm happy for you, sonny.

173
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,689
Hey, come on, hurry on and go!

174
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,267
The dialect of Tosa?

175
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,967
After all, you finally found the culprit.

176
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,695
Hurry on

177
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,697
and nab him!

178
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,699
Shin-chan.

179
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,367
Mom?

180
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,067
Okay, I got you!

181
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:10,967
But I wonder how Shin-chan found the culprit?

182
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,367
By the movement of the faces of the spectators!

183
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,667
The people who are here to watch the match move,

184
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,717
their heads to the right and left watching the ball.

185
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,167
If the ball goes to the left, they move this way.

186
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:24,267
If it's struck back to the right, then this way.

187
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,667
If you're sitting in a seat

188
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,867
where you're watching the players from the side, it's for sure.

189
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:31,467
But, if there's a spectator whose not moving at all,

190
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,467
he would stand out, wouldn't he?

191
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:36,735
If it's during the championship point, the more so.

192
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,367
In other words, that person would be the culprit

193
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,967
who is planning to blow up the mother of the Grass Court Queen,

194
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:47,367
in addition to recording the moment onto a video camera!

195
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,749
He's got to have his target locked inside the frame of his camera

196
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:51,967
before the end of the game,

197
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,753
otherwise his view would be blocked

198
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,467
by the people who stand up in excitement.

199
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:01,567
I see! That's why Shin-chan was telling her

200
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,067
to hang in there, even if her opponent scored the championship point!

201
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,767
He wanted to buy time

202
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:09,367
while they continued the rally to look for the culprit.

203
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,867
The Grass Court Queen sure is amazing, though!

204
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,767
To do as she was told without asking questions.

205
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:19,067
Rather, it was a method that she used to use a lot,

206
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,867
so she probably understood right on the bat.

207
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,785
The lob ball that she displays during her matches

208
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,967
is what she does to find her mother.

209
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,067
Because if she knows that the ball is going to out,

210
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,793
she can take her eyes off the ball.

211
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,167
From among the spectators

212
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,467
that move their heads up and down following the ball,

213
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:42,067
she searches for her visually disabled mother that doesn't do so.

214
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,803
The question is whether Shin-chan

215
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,467
will be able to nab the culprit that he found.

216
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,767
No problem.

217
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:52,811
He's probably going to sneak up behind the culprit

218
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,467
and shoot him with the wristwatch

219
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,815
tranquilizer gun that he usually uses.

220
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,767
Okay, I got you!

221
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,067
You're Holmes' apprentice!

222
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,367
You made Minerva rise!

223
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:05,767
What?

224
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:08,827
But, you know, that was against manners.

225
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,467
Never do it!

226
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,167
Don't tell me he figured out where I am?

227
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:19,467
That's Holmes' apprentice!

228
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:22,567
Then, the guy who looks flustered is...

229
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,843
I've got no choice then.

230
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,467
I'll set the bomb off

231
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,467
and flee out of here amidst the commotion.

232
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,467
Ridiculous! From that distance?

233
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:44,863
Just as expected of the Grass Court Queen.

234
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,167
Nice centering to in front of the goal!

235
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,467
Security guards?

236
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,067
The ball just happened to come...

237
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,467
Thank you.

238
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,367
I see.

239
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,903
You called the police, and had them waiting.

240
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:29,667
Yeah. I asked a friend at Scotland Yard to help me

241
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,267
since I deciphered the code

242
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:34,167
and found out where the culprit's target was.

243
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,067
We really had a hard time backing you up

244
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:40,467
in all kinds of ways to make solving the code easier for you.

245
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,921
Which means that the lady in sunglasses

246
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,667
that was coming around Ran and the others was you, Mom?

247
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:50,267
I thought it was the bomb lady, Hades friend.

248
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,267
As for her, they seemed to have found out

249
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,933
that she really died when she blew herself up the other day!

250
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,667
They confirmed the DNA at the site!

251
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,167
So, that bomb inserted stuffed animal

252
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,267
is what she left behind!

253
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,167
If you knew as much as you did,

254
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,567
why didn't go out and nab him yourself?

255
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,767
The fact is, I'm the one that solved

256
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,867
the 2nd bombing of the hospital.

257
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,767
I couldn't get near the culprit

258
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,867
because he was on the alert for me.

259
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,867
Well, don't get so angry.

260
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,959
Your way of looking for the culprit was just perfect.

261
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,667
Besides, we got tickets

262
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,567
that would enable you to go in all directions

263
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,067
no matter where the culprit was.

264
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,367
But, if you were following the case,

265
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,667
you could've at least contacted me.

266
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:36,967
No. We only came to London because she asked us to.

267
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,167
She?

268
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,467
Game set and match won by...

269
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,167
Miss Grass!

270
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,867
All right!

271
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,367
Well? This feeling...

272
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,367
Is it about time you recalled something?

273
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:58,367
Minerva asked you to quit being a coach,

274
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,667
not only because she wanted you to quit tennis

275
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:04,367
and become her husband.

276
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,867
She wanted you to remember how it felt to feel like this again.

277
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:11,767
Although you quit being a tennis player for her,

278
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,067
you should be true to your feelings, Ales.

279
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,767
You feel a rush inside you too, don't you?

280
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,067
She won! Minerva won!

281
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,023
And since there was no explosion...

282
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,025
They caught the culprit!

283
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:31,767
Yep! I just got a text mail from Holmes' apprentice!

284
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,667
Apollo!

285
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,767
Are you going to be seeing your sister afterwards?

286
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:39,037
I've got something that I've got to tell her.

287
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:43,567
But she may be busy with press conferences and the like...

288
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,767
Why don't you mail her?

289
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,567
I'll give you her mail address!

290
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,667
Yep! Thank you!

291
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,167
Hey. Hold it, there!

292
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,467
Isn't that the lady called Diana?

293
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,967
No way! That's the royal box?

294
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,467
Don't tell me she's a member of the royal family?

295
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,667
Or she could be a noble or a friend of a noble.

296
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,063
Then, don't tell me that

297
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:08,167
the man I threw over my shoulder at the restaurant

298
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,267
could've been a prince or something.

299
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,967
Should I call and ask her?

300
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,567
No, don't. Because I don't want to know.

301
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,667
What was the key to your victory?

302
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,467
What lead to my victory?

303
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:28,467
Well, I suppose I owe it to Holmes' apprentice?

304
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:33,567
But I'm smiling the way I am

305
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,367
thanks to the girl from Japan

306
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,567
who sent me a text mail a while ago.

307
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,567
"Heathrow Airport"

308
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,767
It was really a surprise

309
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,767
that you came all the way to see us off.

310
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,567
Is it really alright?

311
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,567
I'm sure that you're really busy today, and yet...

312
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,115
Yes. I did have a lot of things to do,

313
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,117
but I dropped them all.

314
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:03,767
I wanted to thank you for that mail you sent me, no matter what.

315
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,267
What's this about a mail?

316
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:09,127
Your words really echoed through my heart.

317
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:14,667
It may be true that in tennis love is 0,

318
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,167
but 0 is...

319
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:21,767
Don't say it! Not here!

320
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,567
Because those words

321
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,067
are what originally came from him.

322
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,567
Him?

323
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,147
You mean the "him" that caused you mental anguish

324
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,467
in front of the statue of Holmes?

325
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,767
Yes. Well, sort of...

326
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,267
So stupid.

327
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,867
How stupid of me.

328
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,567
Getting carried away all by myself.

329
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,067
It's just like she said.

330
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,867
Love is 0.

331
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,167
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

332
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,169
the result is miserable defeat.

333
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:53,767
Just what're you talking about?

334
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,667
Don't you get it?

335
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,067
You're a detective, aren't you?

336
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,167
If you're a detective,

337
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,667
why don't you deduce how I'm feeling inside?

338
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,467
Idiot!

339
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,967
Hey, hold it!

340
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,185
Ran!

341
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,067
I'm telling you, wait!

342
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,967
Ran!

343
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,167
Hey!

344
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,467
No, let me go!

345
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:25,203
You're such a nuisance!

346
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:26,367
What?

347
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:29,567
You're a nuisance of a case!

348
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,167
And even if I were Holmes,

349
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,867
I would probably not be able to solve

350
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,067
what's going on in your heart!

351
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,667
It's impossible to solve what's going on

352
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,567
in the heart of a girl you like!

353
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:58,867
Love is 0? What a laugh!

354
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:01,239
You go tell that grass queen

355
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,267
that 0 is start of everything!

356
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:06,167
If you don't start from 0, nothing will start

357
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,667
and you can't achieve anything.

358
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,267
Make sure you tell her that!

359
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,251
I see.

360
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,267
Your boyfriend's pretty cool.

361
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:17,867
So, please relay these words to Ales too.

362
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:21,967
I already mailed Ales and got an answer from him.

363
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,261
He said that he can't see me for a while

364
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:25,067
because he has to go to training.

365
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,367
Huh?

366
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:29,767
That's training for a player somewhere, right?

367
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:32,367
After all, he said he was going to do training for some player.

368
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:35,273
No, it's for his own training!

369
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,967
I think he's planning to make his come-back as a player.

370
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,867
In order to marry a Queen,

371
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,967
I myself, got become a king.

372
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:46,167
And because my body's not as sharp as it used to be,

373
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:50,267
as you said, I've got to start from zero.

374
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,767
Rather, start from love?

375
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:20,267
But it's too bad that Holmes' apprentice is not here.

376
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:23,381
I wanted to thank him, too.

377
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,767
It seems that he had to return to Japan earlier than us

378
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,667
because he had something urgent come up.

379
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,387
Since he got hold of a ticket,

380
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,867
he left a step ahead of us together with Doc.

381
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,967
Please give him my regards then!

382
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,393
I will!

383
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,767
You've got to really be grateful to Ai!

384
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,167
Yeah.

385
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,399
But...

386
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:45,403
That girl named Ai Haibara asked me

387
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,405
to bring you over a spare drug

388
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,407
because she was sure that you would drink up

389
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,867
the two that you brought along with you for Ran.

390
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:56,167
She should give me about a hundred of them while she's at it!

391
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,267
You never learn.

392
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,980
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,136
"Convenience store box lunch"

394
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,894
We had two emergencies to attend to in London.

395
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,960
-Likewise, with the next episode. -Really?
