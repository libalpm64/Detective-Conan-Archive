1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,990
So, that's the story. It's 4, 5, 6...

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,790
It's my 6th this month! 6 cases!

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,100
How about you, Shinichi?

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,200
Me? I solved 7 cases.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh boy, I lost again.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,010
But, Shinichi. Aren't there a bit too many cases around you?

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,810
Well, if you want to do something about your successive losses,

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,210
maybe you should change your name?

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,910
After all, my name's Shin-ichi, like in "ichiban"

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,620
Idiot. You're number 2.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,920
-Number 2? -Yeah.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,420
There was one guy in the past.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,790
A guy who was really intelligent.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,790
A detective.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,300
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
Intermediate school detectives, Heiji and Shinichi.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,800
A deduction battle is launched at the ski slope.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,300
Solve the mystery that is on the lift!

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,710
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,410
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,410
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,450
"Heiji Hattori vs. Shinichi Kudo!"

24
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,850
"Deduction Confrontation at the Ski Slope!"

25
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,730
Kazuha, are you okay?

26
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,630
If your sprained ankle is hurting,

27
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,130
maybe you should go back to the hotel?

28
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm fine! Just fine!

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,140
It's no fun staying back at the hotel alone

30
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,440
and besides, it's fun watching all of you ski.

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
Moreover...

32
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,850
Sorry! Sorry!

33
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,850
I thought that an unattractive statue was sitting in the snow,

34
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,750
but it turns out to be a person.

35
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,750
What's with you? This is the fifth time!

36
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,460
Apologize nicely to Kazuha!

37
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,460
Why should I apologize?

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,960
I splattered snow on her to cool her sprained ankle

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,030
so that it would heal faster.

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,830
Teacher, Heiji is being nasty to girls again!

41
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,340
Just what do you think you're saying?

42
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,140
-Don't pick on us! -Don't pick on us!

43
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,940
The old ladies are angry!

44
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,840
-Old ladies, how dare? -Old ladies, how dare?

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
Hey.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,940
Kazuha.

47
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,350
Don't push yourself and go back to the hotel.

48
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,450
You'll catch cold.

49
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,850
Yeah.

50
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,550
Why are boys all that way?

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,260
I wish the Snow Woman in these mountains eat you up!

52
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,460
Snow Woman?

53
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,630
Teacher said that there's a folk tale in these mountains

54
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,130
called "Legend of Snow Woman's Silver Clothing."

55
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,630
Long ago, in these mountains...

56
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,030
There was a super beautiful woman

57
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,740
wearing silver clothing of dazzling white.

58
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,440
She used to lay her eyes on handsome men that set foot in the mountains

59
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,040
and call out in a blizzardlike voice, and enchant them.

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,850
She would say, "Please exchange my clothing

61
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,350
for something that is precious to you."

62
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,150
Foolish men are taken in by her beautiful white skin under her clothes

63
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,550
and listen to her!

64
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,960
And then?

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,360
The man wraps the clothes he gets from her in a cloth wrapper and asks...

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,630
"The only thing precious that I have on me is this rifle."

67
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,430
"But is this what you want?"

68
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,340
The woman answers from behind the man, "No."

69
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,740
"Then, is it money?"

70
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,240
"No."

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,540
"Is it this hat?"

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,140
"No."

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,250
The man's asks the woman, "Then what is it?"

74
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,350
She then, stark naked clings on to the man from behind.

75
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,350
"It's not something cold that I want."

76
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,350
"What I want really badly is...

77
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,460
your warm, very warm...

78
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,660
blood dripping...

79
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,730
heart!"

80
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,230
See.

81
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,530
After that, the man is found dead.

82
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,540
And inside the cloth wrapper, there is no silver clothing,

83
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,340
but rather... a lot of snow. That's the story.

84
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,940
They say that when a blizzard hits these mountains,

85
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,440
many fall victim.

86
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,540
And even 4 years ago,

87
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,950
there seemed to have been a case very similar to this one.

88
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,050
Hey, students of Kaiho Academy intermediate class!

89
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,350
It's lunchtime!

90
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,960
It's already past two o'clock!

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,460
Huh? Really?

92
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,560
No wonder I'm hungry.

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,130
It seems that there are students from other schools staying here too.

94
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,430
That's why they seem to have shifted lunchtime

95
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,330
to prevent the dining room from becoming crowded.

96
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Isn't that the actor...

97
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,540
"Shohei Minowa (32), actor" -called Shohei Minowa?

98
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,140
What's he doing?

99
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,050
That's right! I saw on TV that they're shooting a movie

100
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,850
after a real case that happened in a snowy mountain.

101
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,050
Huh? I heard that it was a thriller having to do with Snow Woman.

102
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,060
Nonsense.

103
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,860
Well, at any rate, Shohei Minowa's the star of the show

104
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,530
and the fact that he's a detective pursuing some mysterious case

105
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,130
is no mistake.

106
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,130
A detective.

107
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,340
Is it true that this series will be a three-part completed series?

108
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,340
Yeah.

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,040
Is it also true that this movie is made

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,940
after a case that really happened?

111
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,150
That's true, too.

112
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,250
The guy who died was a friend stuntman of mine.

113
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,750
I was at the scene of the crime, too.

114
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,450
Hey, Mr. Minowa.

115
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,660
I don't want you saying too much about the late Mr. Jiro.

116
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,860
Just what're you talking about?

117
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,130
You're the one who's shooting a movie

118
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,930
using your dead friend as bait.

119
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,330
"Morizo Oyama (56), movie director" -Hey, hey.

120
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,130
This is a movie that was made as a tribute to him.

121
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,440
Well, all is well.

122
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,940
Nothing will bring a dead person back to life.

123
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
We can insert something like "A Tribute to Jiro Mikami"

124
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,340
at the end of the movie or something,

125
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,050
"Kosuke Mimata (27), stuntman" -to bring tears to the eyes of the viewers.

126
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,650
And if the movie is a hit, nothing could be better!

127
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,550
Let's be thankful for Mr. Mikami's death

128
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,350
and make a good movie.

129
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,150
Thanks to his death,

130
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,060
you too got to succeed the position you have now.

131
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,830
Well, I warn you, be careful.

132
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,430
You're going to have to do the stunt

133
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,230
"Shizuku Tateishi (31)" -that the late Mikami was supposed to do.

134
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,830
"Special make-up artist" -Let's hope that Snow Woman doesn't seduce you.

135
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,440
But I still don't understand

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,040
why Mizukami would leave a fiance like you behind

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,340
and take his own life.

139
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,150
Who knows?

140
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,450
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

141
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm sure one of you killed him.

142
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,950
What?

143
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,360
You again, Officer.

144
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
No. I heard that you already quit your job as an officer.

145
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,030
Yeah. I was fired working on this case

146
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,830
that was under the jurisdiction of another prefecture.

147
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,730
"Rikuto Katashima (35), detective" -I work as a measly detective now.

148
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,940
I mean, no matter how you look at it, he committed suicide.

149
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,540
True.

150
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,240
4 years ago, a man who rides the lift of this skiing ground alone

151
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,250
had a bullet shot through his head

152
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,150
and was dead when he came down.

153
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,550
He was holding a gun in his right hand,

154
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,250
and on his sleeve there were traces of gunpowder.

155
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,250
Normally, it would look like nothing

156
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,950
more than suicide by shooting oneself,

157
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,460
but something bothers me.

158
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,160
Why was there a load of snow packed

159
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,830
inside the bag that was beside him?

160
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,030
That's because he killed himself

161
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,330
according to the legend of the Snow Woman.

162
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,140
Absurd. I know that guy since childhood,

163
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,340
but he had no interest whatsoever in spook stories.

164
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,440
Besides, even if it were to be so,

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,550
I don't understand why he would do something like that.

166
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,250
Who knows?

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,450
We'll never know unless we ask the dead man himself.

168
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,650
But this, we know for sure...

169
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,760
if it were a murder case,

170
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
it is a case that was impossible for any human to carry out.

171
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,230
Yes, if anyone were to be able to do it,

172
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,630
only the beautiful evil spirit of the mountains,

173
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,630
Snow Woman could've done it.

174
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,630
Idiot.

175
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,940
It's called homicide because some human did it.

176
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,140
Besides, nothing is impossible!

177
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,840
You idiot!

178
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,050
We met a young man like you just a while ago too.

179
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,950
Who said what you just said about this story.

180
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,450
He looked to be your age, an intermediate school student like you.

181
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,650
An intermediate school student?

182
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,360
Heiji!

183
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,530
Maybe somebody's talking about me.

184
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,030
Right.

185
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,540
I mean, you really put on a grand front in the dining room,

186
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,940
so I'm sure somebody's making fun of you now.

187
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,340
Idiot!

188
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,240
I was just trying to wake you up

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,750
from that Snow Woman story you were so panicked out about.

190
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,250
I... I wasn't panicked out or anything.

191
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,250
I just thought that maybe it could be true!

192
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,250
That Snow Woman story...

193
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,960
It's sad and there are many similar stories like it.

194
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,630
Yeah. It's true that it's mysterious.

195
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,530
In Japan, they call the monster

196
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,330
that appears in the most famous Snow Woman story is called...

197
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,840
"Woman of the Snow".

198
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,540
English? I thought that Snow Woman was a Japanese story.

199
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,140
Yeah, it's a Japanese folk tale.

200
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,540
But a man called Lafacadio Hern

201
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,450
who was working as an English teacher in Japan heard about it,

202
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,250
and published it in English.

203
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,650
You know him, don't you, Yagumo Koizumi?

204
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,050
That's his pen name!

205
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,760
Yes, yes. You are so knowledgeable, Shinichi.

206
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
But thank you anyway.

207
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,330
You said what you did to put me at ease, right?

208
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,930
That's not all I did it for.

209
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,030
I thought I had to say so, to keep out of hot water.

210
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,540
I didn't want a storm to start.

211
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
I have this ominous premonition.

212
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,660
Hey, Heiji!

213
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,760
What're you going to do if Snow Woman really appears?

214
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,060
Idiot! If such a woman exists,

215
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,670
I sure would like to meet her.

216
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,370
Heiji.

217
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,070
In order to solve the case of 4 years ago,

218
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,070
first I've to check the lift in question!

219
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,170
And I've got to do it,

220
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,180
before some intermediate school brat beats me to it!

221
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,480
What's the big deal?

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,780
It's just that somebody else thinks like you.

223
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,680
That's why I don't want to lose!

224
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,080
I've got to win,

225
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,690
or people will think that I'm only intermediate level too.

226
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,360
I mean, you're only in intermediate school too, after all.

227
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,460
Ugh, really! Always so lovey-dovey.

228
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,860
You idiot! Don't get us wrong.

229
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,270
The snow's going to melt with the spur that you guys make!

230
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,670
She's talking about somebody else.

231
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,370
Well, you still have time

232
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,270
to check the lift after this blizzard subsides.

233
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,280
Well, I guess so. But before that...

234
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,980
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

236
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,990
Heiji?

237
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,590
Hey! Will you cut it out?

238
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,560
Taking pictures left and right from some time ago.

239
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Heiji! What's the problem?

240
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,560
She could just be taking pictures of this snowy scenery.

241
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,870
No! No! This lady is taking pictures of me!

242
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,770
She's my mom!

243
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,470
What?

244
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,470
Just as would be expected of you, Heiji!

245
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,580
You've got keen senses just like your dad, Heizo!

246
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,180
What brings you here?

247
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,980
I was worried sick over Heiji

248
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,780
because he's rarely come to the Tohoku district.

249
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,190
Oh, give me a break!

250
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,990
All you want to do is make additions to the growth video

251
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,860
that you've been taking of me since I was born!

252
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,660
I'd like to see it.

253
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,060
It was a bad blizzard back then, too.

254
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,970
4 years ago, the day Mizukami died.

255
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,270
On that day, just like now,

256
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,670
while we were waiting to shoot the film,

257
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,270
Minowa was surrounded by his fans.

258
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,680
It seems the blizzard is subsiding!

259
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,980
Is that right?

260
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,080
Please show us your skiing then!

261
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
The awesome ski techniques that you used in

262
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,690
"Love of Snow Woman" and "Mystery!"

263
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,990
Please!

264
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh boy. I've got to shoot a film from now, you see.

265
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,260
No! No!

266
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,460
Ever since we've got here,

267
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,360
fans like you have asked him to ski

268
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,660
and he's already skied three times!

269
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,770
If you want to see him ski, please watch his movie!

270
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,370
What shall I do?

271
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,870
Well, we do have a tight schedule,

272
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,670
but we've got to treat the fans nicely, too.

273
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,280
I think this is what Mizukami would've said.

274
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,880
"It'll work out somehow!"

275
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,580
Oh goodness, he's not here anymore!

276
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,080
Will you please cut it out already?

277
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,480
I'm sorry

278
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,560
that I got you involved in making a movie based on the late Mr. Mizukami

279
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,860
who was supposed to have become your husband.

280
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,060
Don't be. After all,

281
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm the one who asked you to let me participate.

282
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,370
I sort of felt that if this movie is completed,

283
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,270
the truth of his death would be revealed.

284
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,280
Two places...

285
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,380
I looked from below

286
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,980
there are two places where this lift and ski slope come close together.

287
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,580
You mean you can jump onto the lift from below?

288
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,390
No. They come close,

289
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,190
but there's a space of more than 3 meters.

290
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,360
It'd would be impossible to jump on

291
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,660
unless you use a trampoline or something.

292
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,160
Isn't that Shoehei Minowa that was at the hotel?

293
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,070
He's good!

294
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
Encore...

295
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,880
No, no! Just this once for today!

296
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,090
Watch the movie if you want to see more skiing!

297
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,890
It's already 4:00!

298
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,560
We've got to shoot the ski slope above quickly.

299
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,760
Okay, I'll get myself on the lift first!

300
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Because it'll get pitch dark after 5:00.

301
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,660
Hey, Director.

302
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,470
The special make-up artist woman

303
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,170
and the stuntman is nowhere in sight.

304
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,970
They both said that they'd go up before everyone.

305
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,280
Something's fishy.

306
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,980
There sure is something fishy about this lift.

307
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Heiji, this lift is scary.

308
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,890
Kazuha.

309
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,390
You belong to the advance group,

310
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,660
and yet you've never rode a lift?

311
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,860
I have. But it was a different kind.

312
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,160
Gosh. It starting to get windy again.

313
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,270
I can't see the figure of the detective's

314
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,770
who's riding the lift up ahead too clearly.

315
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,770
Hey, Ms. Tateishi!

316
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,570
Oh, Mr. Mimata.

317
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,670
What're you doing? That lift's going down.

318
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,980
I missed the lift.

319
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm not good at things like this.

320
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,560
Shinichi!

321
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,360
What was that sound just now?

322
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,860
The sound of a gunshot.

323
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,660
The ones on the lift were...

324
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,360
Director Oyama,

325
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
the actor, Minowa,

326
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,970
the detective, in that order if I remember correctly.

327
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,770
Did something happen?

328
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,170
It's you.

329
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,180
Beats me. I just got off now.

330
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,710
Stop the lift!

331
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,210
Can't you tell?

332
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,620
Look at that!

333
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,320
Just stop the lift right this minute, will you?

334
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
Then call the police and paramedics!

335
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,020
What? What? Shinichi? Is something wrong?

336
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,490
Don't look, Ran!

337
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,300
The lift stopped.

338
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,400
What's going on?

339
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,900
The thing that sounded like gunfire just a while ago,

340
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
and now that scream.

341
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,200
The lift, gun fire...

342
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Don't tell me that

343
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,810
the same thing as the case 4 years ago has happened again.

344
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,610
We are sorry for the inconvenience!

345
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,510
Please allow a little more time for the lift to resume operation!

346
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,720
What is the meaning of this?

347
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,820
It's almost like what happened back then.

348
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,520
You can say that again.

349
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,820
Just like the time when Mr. Mizukami shot himself to death.

350
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,990
Mizukami.

351
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,100
The gun right as his temple and bang!

352
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
This is suicide.

353
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,200
Yes. He is after all holding the gun in his right hand.

354
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,200
The problem is this bag that's beside the victim.

355
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,700
If it's just as my ominous premonition tells me,

356
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,910
I'm sure that the contents of the bag is...

357
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,010
Snow, just as I thought.

358
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,110
God. It's the same as 4 years ago.

359
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,620
I think I heard that they were shooting a such a movie here.

360
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Yes.

361
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,220
We were shooting a movie having to do with that legend

362
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,420
and what happened here 4 years ago,

363
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,490
but now after what happened to Mr. Minowa, the star of the show...

364
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,490
Huh? Is Minowa an actor?

365
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,200
If I remember correctly, you were here

366
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
when that incident happened 4 years ago too, weren't you?

367
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
I am the director of the movie, Oyama.

368
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
I was on the left one ahead of him.

369
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,700
Then, I heard a gunshot.

370
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,910
That young man who came along when I got off the lift,

371
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,710
noticed that something was wrong with Mr. Minowa.

372
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,210
Hey, kid! Just what do you think you're doing?

373
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,920
We're going to have to get the lift moving soon

374
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
-or the skiers will... -Okay.

375
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,120
After the corpse and his belongings are carried off the lift,

376
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,520
you may move it!

377
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,790
-Do you need help? -No, it's pretty light.

378
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,990
He was slimmer than he looked.

379
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,900
He didn't even weigh 60 kilograms.

380
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,100
That's why he used to only appear in winter dramas and movies.

381
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,000
He didn't want anybody to see how thin he was.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,310
I wonder why he out his skis in the back

383
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,210
instead of wearing them?

384
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,810
Why not?

385
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,810
He was holding a bag filled with snow, you know.

386
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,720
It may have been packed with snow,

387
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,020
but it's just big enough to fit a child inside.

388
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,820
Okay! You can go ahead and move the lift!

389
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,920
Oh, officer.

390
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,190
There are three things that are bothering me.

391
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,700
It finally moved.

392
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,200
Look at the crowd.

393
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
It's frightening.

394
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,510
Idiot! My blood's starting to boil!

395
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,410
Unauthorized personnel stand back! Stand back!

396
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,110
What is it? What on earth happened?

397
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,410
It's you.

398
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,310
It's something just I heard briefly,

399
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,020
but it seems to be exactly the same

400
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,720
as the incident that happened 4 years ago.

401
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,820
It seems that a man who was riding the lift alone

402
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,120
had a bag filled with snow beside him

403
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,890
and killed himself with a gun.

404
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,890
It's as if he were possessed by the Snow Woman!

405
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,800
Hey, not you again.

406
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,000
This isn't your jurisdiction, is it?

407
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No. I'm not an officer anymore, but a detective.

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,310
Besides, I was riding the lift right behind this victim, you know.

409
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,610
Don't you want to ask me questions, officer?

410
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,010
Victim? He committed suicide!

411
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,420
No. I think it's too soon to conclude so yet.

412
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,320
Hey, Heiji! Help!

413
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,620
Just what're you doing? Hurry and get off!

414
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,720
Yeah, but I don't know how to get off.

415
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,520
Okay then, when you reach the bottom,

416
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,190
I'll have them stop the lift, so make sure you get off!

417
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,590
Okay.

418
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,900
That idiot.

419
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
That's why I told her not to come along.

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Come to think of it,

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
there was another person who couldn't get off a while ago.

422
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,700
-Really? -Yes.

423
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,010
She was a pretty lady who had her hair all tied in the back.

424
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,310
No. Mr. Minowa committed suicide?

425
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,510
Why?

426
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,020
Before asking why, will you answer my question?

427
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,220
Why did you want to get off the lift here a while ago?

428
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,920
I couldn't get off!

429
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm not at home with these things.

430
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,490
That's strange.

431
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,200
You came here 4 years ago too, to shoot a movie, right?

432
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Back then, I had Mr. Mizukami ride with me.

433
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
This time I had Mr. Mimata ride with me.

434
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,700
She's not very physically inclined, you see.

435
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,810
Huh? The director told me that you would be going up ahead.

436
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,410
Why are you riding the lift with her?

437
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,110
Standby for the shooting is was all set,

438
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,110
but the director and main star didn't come up the slope

439
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,520
so I skied down here to come get them!

440
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Then, I saw her coming down on the lift,

441
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,920
so I called out to her, and that's when I heard the gun shot.

442
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,990
I had this bad feeling

443
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,600
so had him ride the lift with me and went back up again!

444
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,100
I mean, the thing about 4 years ago was bothering me, too.

445
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,700
Then, the lift stopped

446
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,800
and I finally got to come down a while ago!

447
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,910
I see. In other words...

448
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,810
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa,

449
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,110
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was behind,

450
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,420
Ms. Tateishi, who passed him on the lift going down

451
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,320
and Mr. Mimata who was on the ski slope...

452
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,220
All could've shot at Mr. Minowa.

453
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,990
-Hey. -Hey, now.

454
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,990
Weren't you listening to what we were just saying?

455
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,100
I was with Mr. Mimata when the gunshot was heard.

456
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
If that gunshot was fake,

457
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,800
the murder would've been possible.

458
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,100
Is this what you want to say, sonny?

459
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Yeah, right!

460
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,610
But Mr. Minowa was holding the gun in his hand, you know.

461
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,910
It would be impossible to make him to that

462
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,210
if you're some distance away, right?

463
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,410
You can't tell him to hold the gun

464
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,220
because you're going to be shooting him, can you?

465
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,320
Besides, the blizzard was pretty bad back then.

466
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,620
You'd have to be a darn good shooter

467
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,820
to shoot down the target at that time.

468
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,620
Well, I'm not too sure of this yet,

469
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,090
but there's something I realized.

470
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,600
First, the ski poles that Mr. Minowa

471
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,900
is said to have put on the lift!

472
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,200
The loops on both tips of the poles are both upside down.

473
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,000
It's proof that the poles were used for something!

474
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,310
Next is the lift that Mr. Minowa was on.

475
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,210
There is what looks to be a crack on the left edge of the plastic seat.

476
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,020
I'm sure that this is the result of some trick that was used, too.

477
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,520
And last,

478
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,320
is this cloth bag filled with snow

479
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,720
that Mr. Minowa had placed beside himself.

480
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,790
I don't know why but it's frozen stiff.

481
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,190
No, no, don't touch his belongings.

482
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,700
But you intermediate school kids nowadays sure are full of curiosity.

483
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,700
There was another one just like you, an intermediate school student,

484
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,610
who boastfully told we the police

485
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,610
the three points you just mentioned, too.

486
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,210
What?

487
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,310
He was here until just before you got here.

488
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,410
I've finally made it down.

489
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,220
I'll never ride a lift ever again.

490
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,020
-Kazuha. -Kazuha.

491
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,320
You're not supposed to be in advance ski class, are you?

492
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
You don't even know how to get off a lift!

493
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,890
Be honest!

494
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,390
You just wanted to be in the advance class

495
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,200
because Heiji was there, right?

496
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,100
I'll bet your sprained leg is fake, too.

497
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,500
Oh, no.

498
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,900
Don't worry.

499
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,700
-We won't tell Heiji about it. -Excuse me!

500
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,900
-I'm really sorry. -Is there anyone here

501
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,210
who took a video Mr. Minowa riding the lift a while ago?

502
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,810
If you don't mind, I've taken him with mine.

503
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,410
Thank you so much!

504
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,720
You sure took nice pictures.

505
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,820
If you're Mr. Minowa's fan,

506
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,520
you could've just kept to shooting videos of him only and yet.

507
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,820
Well, my son asked me to.

508
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,020
He told me to take pictures of the boarding gate of the lift

509
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
because he wanted to use it as reference

510
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,490
for the incident that happened 4 years ago.

511
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,490
Is your son a police officer or something?

512
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,800
He's a mere intermediate school student.

513
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,100
Although he thinks he's a detective.

514
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,800
A detective? Just like me.

515
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,510
My, Shinichi is chatting with a beautiful madam.

516
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,810
Really, I wonder who he took after.

517
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,110
No, he's wearing the facial expression of a detective.

518
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,910
He's still green.

519
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,620
And? Has the self-proclaimed world renown mystery novel writer

520
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,820
solved this case?

521
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,320
Yukiko. What a silly question.

522
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,890
What? Have you figured it out, Yusaku?

523
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,290
I came all the way here because I wanted to write a novel

524
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,100
based on what happened 4 years ago,

525
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,600
but to think that a movie based on it was already being made,

526
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,800
and that a similar incident is happening right now...

527
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,700
If you've figured out who the culprit is,

528
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,910
why don't you contact the police right away?

529
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,410
No. Let's leave things to the young ones for a while

530
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,010
and watch how things turn out.

531
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,110
Well, at least give me a hint then.

532
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,610
Do you know?

533
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,420
That there is another Snow Woman silver clothing legend

534
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,720
that exists in these mountains.

535
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,120
It is a heartbreaking and sad story.

536
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,530
What? Mr. Minowa, the actor committed suicide?

537
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,330
Is that true, Heiji?

538
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,930
Don't talk too loud!

539
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,430
It still hasn't been publicized.

540
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,330
But, how'd something like that happen?

541
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,400
Beats me, I don't know yet.

542
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,810
It's dubious whether it's really suicide or not, too.

543
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,010
It's the same as the incident that occurred 4 years ago.

544
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,810
Then, isn't it suicide?

545
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,610
That's why I came to confirm it on video.

546
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,820
How is it? Did you find anything, Heiji?

547
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,120
Just as I thought. This is homicide.

548
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,430
That video is sure popular.

549
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,430
Popular?

550
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,430
There was another person

551
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,530
who asked to see that video besides you.

552
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,730
Don't tell me that he was an intermediate school student too?

553
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes, one of them was.

554
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,900
One of them? You mean there were others?

555
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,210
Way before that boy came...

556
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,410
A dandy man with a mustache came.

557
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,510
A man with a mustache?

558
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,120
Another Snow Woman legend...

559
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,320
Is that the hint for solving the incident?

560
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,620
Well, as for the questions,

561
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,220
ask me after you hear me out.

562
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,520
Long time ago, on a stormy blizzard night,

563
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,030
there was a man named Shigekichi,

564
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,030
who was rushing back home from these mountains.

565
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,530
Part way home,

566
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:39,000
he ran into a long haired, beautiful woman wearing a silver kimono.

567
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,110
The woman lifted her head, and said with pleading eyes...

568
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,610
I sprained my ankle while walking along the mountain path

569
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,210
and can walk no farther.

570
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,220
Will you please take me to my house?

571
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,320
When Shigekichi asks her where her house is,

572
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,330
the woman silently points a dark forest where there is no road.

573
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,130
But, no matter how far he walks,

574
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,430
only the snow gets deeper and there is no house anywhere in sight.

575
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,100
Therefore, the man finally asks the woman...

576
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,300
Is this the right road?

577
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,910
The woman nods without saying a word.

578
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:21,010
The woman was waiting for the man to throw her down.

579
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,820
Yes. Because the identity of the woman

580
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,420
was "Snow Woman" who would eat the soul of the man

581
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,920
when he ran out of strength.

582
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,630
The man's steps eventually become slow.

583
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,430
After a while, the mouth of the woman

584
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,330
who had been silent up to now slightly moves.

585
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,930
Young lady.

586
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,130
The woman smiles as if she had been waiting

587
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,500
for the time to come and answers.

588
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,210
Yes, what is it?

589
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,310
Shigekichi is heaving heavily

590
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,910
but squeezes out what he has to say...

591
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,810
Aren't you cold?

592
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,920
The woman is flustered by the man's unexpected question,

593
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,120
and is at a loss for words.

594
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,920
Shigekichi endures the cold and exhaustion he feels

595
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,620
and walks on with all his might.

596
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,730
"Isn't it clustered inside the basket? Aren't you hungry?"

597
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,630
He tells her that there's only a little more to go,

598
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,530
so to hang in there.

599
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,400
Although the woman answers him,

600
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,910
her voice gets weaker and weaker.

601
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,610
Then, finally her voice is not heard.

602
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,610
Shigekichi gets worried and stops.

603
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,110
He puts the basket down and looks inside.

604
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,120
The woman is nowhere in sight.

605
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,620
But a large amount of snow was found wrapped in a silver cloth.

606
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,430
I see. Shigekichi's warm heart

607
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,630
melted the cold Snow Woman's heart.

608
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,030
-Yeah. -And, so what's the hint?

609
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,400
So I guess the load is too heavy for you, after all.

610
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
But, for him,

611
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,910
I guess it would be a good problem solving exercise.

612
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,210
-Him? -I'm sure that he's watching the movie

613
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,310
that Mr. Minowa appeared in at the hotel right now,

614
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,310
being that he's our son.

615
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,520
See, it's just as I thought.

616
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,420
Mr. Minowa's style of skiing that we saw this afternoon

617
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,720
is different from his style of skiing in the movie, right?

618
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,820
You think so?

619
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820
I think they're both good, like that of a professional.

620
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,930
That's how people evaluate his skiing.

621
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,030
Take a look at this scene

622
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,030
where Mr. Minowa comes to rescue the heroine.

623
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,600
He comes skiing from the top until he frames out...

624
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,400
See, his cap strap is on.

625
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,310
But after he frames in again

626
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,710
when he carries her up, it's not on anymore.

627
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,710
And it's supposed to be a cut that is connected.

628
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,710
True.

629
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,310
Don't tell me that he's using a double.

630
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,720
-Maybe he can't ski? -No way.

631
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,820
He was skiing just a while ago and it was awesome!

632
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,720
Was it really him?

633
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,220
Of course.

634
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
I filmed it on video.

635
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,930
-See. -Hey, Sonoko.

636
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,630
While Mr. Minowa was skiing his way here,

637
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,430
do you know where he had this bag?

638
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,500
Mr. Minowa put it in front of his fans himself.

639
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,100
He told them to watch it for him until he got back

640
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,910
because he had important things inside it.

641
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,610
What? This bag?

642
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,510
An intermediate school boy came to look at it?

643
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,910
-When was that? -Just now.

644
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,120
He didn't buy it though.

645
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
If that's too small,

646
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,120
we have one with the same design a size larger.

647
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,320
Is that right?

648
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,220
The belt stretches this much and it's quite convenient.

649
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,530
True.

650
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,230
What's so convenient.

651
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,330
Hey, Heiji. What're you angry about?

652
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,930
It's only natural.

653
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,700
Some intermediate school kid is one step ahead of me each time.

654
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,500
He borrowed the video from the hotel before I did,

655
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,210
and a queer mustached man also seems involved.

656
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,310
If things go as is, they'll solve the case before I do.

657
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,010
Which means that you still have no idea, Heiji?

658
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,320
I do. I know who the killer is and the method that was used.

659
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,520
I found out when we went to that store a while ago.

660
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,020
Then, why not report it to the police right away?

661
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,820
But there's something I can't solve.

662
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,730
The loops on the poles that were on upside down

663
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,830
and the reason the bag was filled with snow.

664
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,430
My deduction cannot be proven unless I solve these problems.

665
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,030
What is it, Shizuka?

666
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,000
I thought I told you not to make private calls to me at work.

667
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,810
What, a case?

668
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,010
-I found it! This is it! -What's that?

669
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,020
Remember the gunshot like noise that Mr. Minowa might've heard

670
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,120
before reaching the top on the lift.

671
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,220
The fact that this hasn't been retrieved yet,

672
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,420
means that the killer is still somewhere unable to make a move.

673
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,430
My, you sound like you know it all already.

674
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,130
No, the most important trick that was used in the murder

675
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,030
is still not solved completely.

676
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,230
The scratch that was left

677
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,930
on the left side of the corpse on the lift...

678
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,500
I can't figure out what it is.

679
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,610
I figured out the snow packed bag and the killer,

680
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,010
but they don't connect right.

681
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,010
You've figured out who the killer is?

682
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,110
Yeah. There are four suspects

683
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,210
who are being interrogated by the police now.

684
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,820
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa.

685
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was riding the lift

686
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,620
right behind Mr. Minowa.

687
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,020
Stuntman Mr. Mimata, who was at the ski slope

688
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,530
to call the director and the others.

689
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,730
And Ms. Tateishi who failed to make it off the lift.

690
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,330
Wait, I can see that you know where Director Oyama was riding,

691
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,600
but how do you know where the other three were riding?

692
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,100
Do your really know who the killer is?

693
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,810
Mrs. Kudo!

694
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,710
I got to hear what the police

695
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,910
was questioning them about, you see.

696
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,510
What? But, how, why?

697
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,220
It just so happened that our trip and Shinichi's ski class

698
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,520
coincidentally turned out to be the same place.

699
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,720
I mean, you deliberately came here.

700
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,620
But Shinichi, you were 30 minutes late.

701
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,230
An intermediate school boy just like you was here just a while ago.

702
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,030
What?

703
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,800
You mean there's another deduction freak just like Shinichi.

704
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,410
That's new to me!

705
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,910
Talking about another, do you know?

706
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,710
About the other Snow Woman legend.

707
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,210
No god, it's pitch dark already.

708
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,320
The killer is being interrogated now and can't move just yet.

709
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,020
But if he's released, he will hide the evidence.

710
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,320
Heiji!

711
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,820
What is it, Mom?

712
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,430
Rain makes puddles.

713
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,530
But with snow, you can make a snowman.

714
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,630
If that becomes ice, a large statue can also be made.

715
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,400
But Yusaku says that this is the key to solving the mystery.

716
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,210
Don't let outward appearance fool you.

717
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,110
By Heizo.

718
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,510
What's he trying to get at anyway?

719
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,710
Why talk about snowmen now?

720
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,310
Heiji?

721
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,430
Will you cut it out?

722
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,230
I'm sorry, but can you answer the phone for me?

723
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,230
-It's in the pocket of my coat. -Yes, sir.

724
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,230
Who is it?

725
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,130
His hands are tied right now.

726
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,040
I've figured everything out.

727
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,740
I've figured out who killed Mr. Minowa under the pretense of suicide.

728
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,740
What?

729
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,450
As well as the trick that made the murder possible.

730
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,550
-Everything! -Huh?

731
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,720
An intermediate school boy again.

732
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
I'll bet you want to say that all four of us

733
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,920
were capable of shooting Mr. Minowa, right?

734
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Like I said before, it's impossible for us to have done it!

735
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,430
Since he was riding the lift alone,

736
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,730
we couldn't have made him hold the gun.

737
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,630
Maybe the ex-cop and now detective could've done it,

738
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,430
but we could never aim and shoot at his head

739
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,640
in a blizzard like back then.

740
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,040
Hey, hey, even an ex-cop can't do something like that.

741
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,740
Because the blizzard was so bad

742
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,340
that you couldn't even see the lift in front of you.

743
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,850
True.

744
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,720
Murder would've been impossible in that situation

745
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,220
if Mr. Minowa was really riding the lift alone.

746
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,920
What?

747
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,930
Hey, hey, don't tell me that

748
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:51,130
you're going to say that somebody was inside that bag?

749
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,130
But that bag was packed with snow,

750
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,330
and no adult would've possibly been inside.

751
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,140
No, no, a bag this size was inside.

752
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,940
The same kind of bag that is one size larger

753
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
and of the same design was sold at the shop of the hotel.

754
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,050
It can't be.

755
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,720
Are you saying that Mr. Minowa was carrying a bag

756
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,620
with the killer inside it when he got on the lift?

757
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,720
No, the one who was in the bag wasn't the killer,

758
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,920
but Mr. Minowa himself.

759
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,930
No, that can't be!

760
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,830
Then, the person who was carrying the bag was?

761
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,830
The killer.

762
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,830
Most of Mr. Minowa's face is hidden by his hair,

763
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,940
and he was wearing sunglasses back then.

764
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,540
If someone else were to wear a wig, a knitted cap,

765
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,240
sunglasses and ski wear,

766
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,140
people would be deluded to think it were Mr. Minowa.

767
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,450
But he talked to me and his fans.

768
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,320
It was Mr. Minowa's voice, of course.

769
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,820
-How? -That's because Mr. Minowa himself

770
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,220
was listening closely from inside the bag and responding to everyone.

771
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,530
That's why everybody thought that he disguised killer was Minowa.

772
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,030
-Oh no... -I see.

773
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,640
That's why he was silent until he carried that bag.

774
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,140
You've got to be kidding.

775
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,640
A person as proud as he, would never go inside a bag.

776
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,840
That's probably because...

777
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,550
He was a proud person.

778
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,350
That's why he went inside.

779
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,420
The fact that his skiing was of a professional level

780
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,520
was just a front and fake.

781
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,220
It was probably all a lie.

782
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,920
A lie?

783
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,430
I guess he could ski a bit,

784
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,430
but not good enough like a professional.

785
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,730
I watched the movie, that Mr. Minowa appeared in,

786
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,530
"The Snow Woman's Love" and the "Mystery of Snow Woman"

787
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,040
back at the hotel a while ago.

788
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,840
Then there was a scene where he ran over to the heroine on skis

789
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,440
and framed out once. Then he zoomed back into the scene.

790
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,750
Moreover, when he was skiing, the cap trap was on.

791
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,120
When he zoomed, it wasn't there.

792
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,120
This means that someone else skied for him.

793
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,320
Isn't that right, director?

794
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,130
Yeah. It wasn't that he couldn't ski,

795
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,530
but he hurt his leg in the first movie.

796
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,530
But he insisted on skiing himself,

797
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,840
so in order to persuade him, I secretly used a stuntman in his place.

798
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,040
That ski scene was ironically evaluated highly.

799
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,540
So, I used a stuntman secretly in the 2nd movie, too.

800
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,750
You did?

801
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,250
That's why, when the fans asked him to ski,

802
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,320
he let his substitute ski for him

803
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,920
and went into the bag and waited below.

804
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,420
Then, when his substitute came and carried the bag,

805
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,330
he conversed with the fans to act out his role.

806
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,930
Hey, hold it.

807
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,730
Don't tell me that the substitute is...

808
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,230
Yeah. The one who had that role,

809
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,640
carried the bag that Mr. Minowa was inside, and killed him is...

810
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,040
Stuntman, Mr. Mimata!

811
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,250
No one else but you could've done it.

812
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,020
-Mr. Mimata? -Is it true?

813
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,320
But I think that the one who did the stunt

814
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,020
for the movie 4 years ago was the late Mr. Mizukami,

815
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,430
because the skiing in the movie and today's skiing was different.

816
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,830
It's most likely that before Mr. Mizukami died,

817
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,930
Mr. Mimata secretly took on the role,

818
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,840
and he used it to his advantage to carry out the murder on the lift.

819
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,340
Right! He took only Mr. Minowa's head

820
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,640
out of the bag on the lift and held it down,

821
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,540
stuck the gun at his temple and fired.

822
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,250
He then took Mr. Minowa out of the bag and sat him down

823
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,920
and made him hold the gun.

824
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,820
He then carried the bag and jumped off.

825
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,920
There are two places where the space

826
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,330
between the lift and the ground is only about 3 meters.

827
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,230
The scratch that was found on the seat of the lift

828
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,530
was one that was made when he shot Mr. Minowa.

829
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,230
And the fact that Mr. Minowa was sitting on the left when on the lift,

830
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,140
but was found sitting on the right side when found dead

831
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,140
is evidence that this is what actually happened.

832
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,940
It sure is difficult

833
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,250
to shift the position of a dead person on a lift.

834
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,250
But, when the gunshot was heard,

835
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,220
Mr. Mimata was talking to me.

836
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,620
That was probably the sound of a rocket fire cracker.

837
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,220
After he wore the ski wear

838
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,720
that he had ready by the place he got off the lift,

839
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,820
he probably ignited the fuse of the rocket fire cracker

840
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,030
with a lighted cigarette and poked it into a PET bottle.

841
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,330
He fired it shifting the time a bit to make a witness for his alibi,

842
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:24,940
by skiing down and talking to somebody when the sound is heard.

843
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,940
But, where did he get the bag that was packed with snow?

844
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,140
I just said that there are two places

845
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,440
where that lift is only 3 meters away from the ground.

846
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,850
That's where the bag with the upside down ski pole

847
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,820
hooked onto it was place, and later carried up to the lift.

848
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,420
I see. 3 meters to the ground...

849
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,520
Ski poles are approximately 1 meter and 20 centimeters.

850
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,120
If the string one side is hooked on to the other pole and connected,

851
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,730
stretching over for it may make it reachable,

852
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,530
but would it be possible to pick it up in that blizzard?

853
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,430
No, no! Only one ski pole was used,

854
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,230
and the remaining 1 meter...

855
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,340
was made by wetting the string of the cloth bag

856
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,640
with water and freezing it.

857
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,440
That's how the remaining one meter was compensated for.

858
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,850
The loops of both poles were upside down

859
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,150
because just one being upside down would draw attention.

860
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,620
But I wonder if you can see that bag from on top the lift?

861
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,220
I mean the blizzard was so bad

862
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,420
that even the lift ahead couldn't be seen, right?

863
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,020
Did you know that the space between one lift and the other

864
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,530
has to be more than 6 seconds apart?

865
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,430
The speed at which a lift moves

866
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,030
is from 1.5 meters to 2 meters per second,

867
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,330
which means that the space between one lift and the other

868
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,330
is about 10 meters apart.

869
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,540
Even if it is hard to something that is 10 meters apart,

870
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,640
the bag that was only 3 meters apart could easily be seen.

871
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,940
More so, if you know that the bag is already there...

872
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,340
But, what proof do you have?

873
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,250
I've got proof, too.

874
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,220
If Mr. Mimata met with Ms. Tateishi

875
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,120
and went directly to be interrogated in the lodge,

876
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,420
he still should have it on him.

877
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,530
The same ski wear that Mr. Minowa was wearing.

878
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,530
Maybe you even have the bag that Mr. Minowa inside, too?

879
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,430
I was enduring all this time.

880
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,740
It was so hot.

881
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,340
Mr. Mimata!

882
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,940
So, you the one who did it, after all.

883
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,640
Which means that you knew, director.

884
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,840
Yeah.

885
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,150
I thought that your skiing had improved in the end,

886
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,520
but when I saw him dead, I realized it was you.

887
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,220
But, why?

888
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,120
I avenged the death of Mr. Mizukami

889
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,220
who was supposed to become your husband.

890
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,130
I killed Minowa using the same trick

891
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,530
that was used to kill Mr. Mizukami 4 years ago.

892
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,930
Just what do you mean?

893
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,630
Remember 4 years ago, that day,

894
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,240
Minowa was troubled surrounded by his fans,

895
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,940
Mr. Mizukami said we can work something out.

896
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,440
He meant that

897
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,950
he would secretly put Minowa inside a bag and carrying him over.

898
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,920
But Minowa took advantage of Mr. Mizukami's kindness and killed him.

899
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,720
He killed Mr. Mizukami who was planning on quitting his job as a stuntman

900
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,220
and become an actor!

901
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,520
He told me when I held him at gun point.

902
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,430
There's no way he can make a living as an actor.

903
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,530
I'm sure that when he gets desperate,

904
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,630
he is going to write a book on me and disclose everything!

905
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,530
I guess he was scared.

906
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,930
How ironic

907
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,240
that a movie that is just the thing to carry out the revenge is to be shot.

908
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,740
The fact is, I too, thought that the killer of the incident

909
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,340
that happened 4 years ago was Minowa.

910
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,150
That's why I decided to make this movie.

911
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,110
I didn't reveal anything yet,

912
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,620
but the real killer of this movie

913
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,020
was scheduled to be Minowa, who was acting the role of a detective.

914
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
The trick used is the same as was used 4 years ago

915
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,020
as Mr. Mimata had just mentioned.

916
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,530
I figured that he would give himself in if I showed him the script.

917
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,830
I know that it's not for me, who quit being an officer to say,

918
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,730
but if you knew so much,

919
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,340
I would've wanted you to prevent this stupid murder.

920
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,540
Revenge only breeds revenge,

921
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,440
and the feeling of accomplishment vanishes on the spot...

922
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,140
It's just like the snow that falls onto the palm of your hand.

923
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,520
Well, we'll hear you out at the station.

924
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,420
You'll come along too, won't you?

925
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,730
Inspector, what about the intermediate school boy on the phone?

926
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,530
He is telling of the exact same deduction of as that boy

927
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,630
with the exact same timing.

928
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,840
-What? -What?

929
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,440
Heiji, why aren't you going with him?

930
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,940
Idiot! If I leave,

931
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,940
who's going to piggy back you back to the hotel down below?

932
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,350
Doh-doh.

933
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,550
I finally figured out that

934
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,320
the belt of the bag was frozen only after dad dropped me a hint.

935
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,120
That's why as far as the intermediate school boy

936
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,720
that solved this case alone,

937
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
I don't want to see him.

938
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,030
Why not?

939
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,530
Why should I go when you're the one who solved the case?

940
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,530
Take the PET bottle along with you,

941
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,530
and tell him that you solved the case by yourself.

942
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,830
I only figured everything out

943
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,640
after dad told me the story of the Snow Woman

944
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,940
who pretended that she sprained her leg and went into the basket.

945
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,840
That's when I figured out that Mr. Minowa who wanted to pretend

946
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,740
that he was a good skier went into the bag himself.

947
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,350
But your deduction was correct, wasn't it?

948
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,320
No, this case was solved by the intermediate school boy

949
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,020
who figured everything out himself, not me.

950
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,120
-Hey. -Quiet.

951
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,520
That's what you get for coming along with me,

952
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,820
despite having sprained your leg!

953
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,330
I'll bet you sprained your leg when practicing

954
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,230
just so you could brag that you're an advanced skier.

955
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,030
Well, thanks to you showing off,

956
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:24,540
I figured out why Mr. Minowa went into the bag right away,

957
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,540
and you also helped with a lot of things

958
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,240
so I guess I'll forgive you.

959
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,140
Idiot. I didn't practice

960
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,040
because I wanted to show everybody how good I was.

961
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,520
I wonder why there are two different stories about the Snow Woman?

962
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,520
I'll bet it's because the storyteller was a mother.

963
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,220
It's said that the folk tale of Snow Woman

964
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,130
was created as a warning to people to stay indoors during blizzards,

965
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,130
and while mothers continued telling their children this story,

966
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,130
they began feeling empathy for her

967
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,640
and gradually changed the story.

968
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,840
In other words, it first started as a story

969
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,640
of her killing her victims after exchanging her silver clothing,

970
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,840
but it changed to a story in which, she did not take the soul,

971
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,650
but rather, just melted into snow.

972
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,650
That's why the stories of Snow Woman

973
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,420
are sad and sound quite familiar.

974
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,330
I couldn't see very well because of the snow.

975
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,130
But I'll bet it's him that intermediate school boy.

976
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,130
Well, even if I don't see him, if he's a detective...

977
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,940
We'll get to see each other one day on some mysterious stage.

978
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,460
So, that super intelligent detective left

979
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,670
without giving the police his name.

980
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,670
How about it? Unlike the detective that I know before he shrunk,

981
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,370
this guy is intelligent and modest!

982
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,080
I mean, you know, that's me.

983
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,840
Next Conan's Hint:

984
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,680
"Coin Locker"

985
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,360
This is the closet we get to the Black Organization.

986
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,860
Oh, no, Shinichi and we suddenly approach each other rapidly.

987
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,860
Why is Conan involved?
