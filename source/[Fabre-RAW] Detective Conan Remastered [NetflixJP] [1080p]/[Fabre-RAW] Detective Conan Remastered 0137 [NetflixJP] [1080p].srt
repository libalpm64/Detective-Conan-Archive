1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,480
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,580
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,280
It's case closed for the mysterious castle!

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,980
Will Conan really be all right?

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,480
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,980
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,390
We, the Youth Detective Squad and Dr. Agasa,

9
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,390
set out to go camping.

10
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,490
We get lost on the way home,

11
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,090
and run into a castle surrounded by a forest.

12
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,390
We luckily get to stay over at the castle,

13
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,490
but the members of the Mamiya family

14
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,890
seem to be have a veiled history behind them.

15
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,390
I happen to find a hidden door in one of the rooms of the castle,

16
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,990
and ran into a mummified corpse!

17
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,790
However, just at that time...

18
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,090
"The Old Blue Castle (Part 2)"

19
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,390
What is this supposed to be?

20
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,590
Doc.

21
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,090
Oh, hello, is this the police?

22
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,390
I'm calling on behalf of Shinichi Kudo.

23
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,690
Please put me through to Inspector Megure of the 1st division.

24
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,690
Oh? Are you calling your friend or something, little lady?

25
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,790
Hello, this is Megure...

26
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,290
-Yes, I guess you could say that. -Hello...

27
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,790
Oh, Haibara!

28
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,890
There you are!

29
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,490
Geez, where'd you go?

30
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,990
Our bed's ready!

31
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,590
Where's Doc?

32
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,590
Wasn't he with you?

33
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,290
No. Maybe he's looking for the treasure in this castle.

34
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,590
Doc's bed is empty.

35
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,590
I'm sure something fell upon them after all.

36
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,990
Grandmother?

37
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,990
What brings you out here at this time of night?

38
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,290
I came to pick up my daughter

39
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,190
because it's taking her so long to come.

40
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,190
Just leave Mother up to us,

41
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,790
and go back to your room and rest.

42
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,590
Anyway, I need to investigate this matter.

43
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,890
Just as I thought.

44
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,790
Just what are you guys doing?

45
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,890
We're worried about Conan.

46
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,190
Dr. Agasa's not back either, besides...

47
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,190
We'll help you search too.

48
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,590
The more the merrier!

49
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,790
Right, right!

50
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,790
Well, all right.

51
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,590
I won't be held responsible even if you're killed.

52
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,890
-Hey? -What do you mean?

53
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,790
This is the room that...

54
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,490
The room that we came in the afternoon, right?

55
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,390
Kojima,

56
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,490
can you take the chair and put it by the under the clock?

57
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,290
Yeah.

58
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,890
Haibara?

59
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,590
What on earth are you doing?

60
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,790
What is this?

61
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,690
It's a hidden corridor.

62
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,290
It was rigged so that by manually spinning

63
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,690
the hand of the clock, the door opens.

64
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,790
Let's go.

65
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,190
Oh, that's...

66
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,890
Yes. Dr. Agasa gave this wristwatch type light to me.

67
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,690
Oh, so you got one from him too!

68
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,390
What do you mean, you too?

69
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,390
Oh, that's just great.

70
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,690
Let's go.

71
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,490
What a long stairway.

72
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,690
What is that?

73
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,790
-It's blood. -What?

74
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,890
Judging from the color and how dry it is,

75
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,090
it hasn't been here for that long yet.

76
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,190
Wow, Haibara, you're just like Conan!

77
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,590
We've got no time to waste.

78
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,990
This may be his blood, you know.

79
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,390
Please take a look! There are some letters carved on the stairs!

80
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:52,090
"He" is an impostor... trying to take the treasure of the castle...

81
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,090
It seems that the person

82
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,590
wanted to write "away from me" or something.

83
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,690
Could it be that Conan wrote this?

84
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,590
No, judging from the sentence, it can't be.

85
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,590
It seems to have been carved quite some time ago too.

86
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,390
Who on earth wrote it?

87
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,590
I don't know.

88
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,990
But, since the carving is cut off

89
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,890
before the sentence is finished.

90
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,290
The person couldn't finish writing for some reason.

91
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,590
Couldn't finish writing?

92
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,290
No...

93
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,590
Right, it could be that the person died here.

94
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,390
If Conan found the corpse, and was distracted by it,

95
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,790
when someone either hit or stabbed him from behind,

96
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,590
that explains the blood stain.

97
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,390
Hey, something's on the floor!

98
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,690
It looks like glasses.

99
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,190
Hey, isn't this...

100
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,890
Dr. Agasa's glasses?

101
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,390
Why is Dr. Agasa's glasses here?

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,990
It's cracked and it also has blood on it.

103
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,490
Could something have happened to Dr. Agasa?

104
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,990
Haibara?

105
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,490
What's the matter?

106
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,490
This is the place where I lost track of Dr. Agasa a while ago.

107
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,390
How strange.

108
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,290
This door won't open.

109
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,290
But, Genta's still inside.

110
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,590
We have no choice

111
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,190
but to enter from where we first did and join him.

112
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,690
-Okay. -Darn!

113
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,190
What's going on? It opened just a while ago!

114
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,590
Huh?

115
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,490
It seems to be locked.

116
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,190
What? It was open just a while ago.

117
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,790
Somebody was tailing us.

118
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,390
The door was locked

119
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,290
so that we won't be able to go back along the corridor

120
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,690
and flee outside.

121
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,490
Although we coincidentally made it out the door just a while ago..

122
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,990
Which means that Genta...

123
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,290
There is no doubt that he probably fell into the hands

124
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,290
of the person who tailed us.

125
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,090
Oh, no.

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,890
Let's look for another way to get into that corridor.

127
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,390
While there is still a possibility

128
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,290
of the threesome who disappeared still being alive.

129
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,090
What a big room...

130
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,490
This is probably Sir Takahito's atelier

131
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,290
because he said he draws.

132
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,990
Wow, there are a whole lot of newspapers.

133
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,690
He uses them to wrap his drawings and wipe his brushes!

134
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,790
It sure does look old, though.

135
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,090
This is?

136
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,290
An article of the fire that occurred 4 years ago!

137
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,790
That's...

138
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,390
It's Conan's glasses.

139
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,090
15 were killed in the fire.

140
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,090
Since the fire had burned the bones to ashes,

141
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,290
identification of the bodies

142
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,790
were made by the accessories they were wearing.

143
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,390
There is still one person whose whereabouts is still unknown.

144
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,990
So, someone took advantage of this fire,

145
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,990
and switched himself with another.

146
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,190
Mitsuhiko is gone.

147
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,290
Maybe he went inside that door.

148
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,490
Strange.

149
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
That's the entrance of the tower where the fire broke out.

150
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,990
It was supposed to have been locked.

151
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,490
-Mitsuhiko! -Wait.

152
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,790
It could be a trap.

153
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,490
I'll go inside and check it

154
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,490
so you go and hide in the grass nearby.

155
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,490
But...

156
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,790
If I don't come out by the time you count to 300,

157
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,690
get out of here immediately.

158
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,590
If you run down the path of the forest,

159
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,290
you may luckily be saved.

160
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,690
-Haibara... -You've got to be brave!

161
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,390
You're going to give that bread to Conan, aren't you?

162
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,690
Yes.

163
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,990
Two.

164
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,790
Three.

165
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,890
Four.

166
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,090
Five...

167
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,690
83.

168
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,290
84.

169
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,990
85. 86.

170
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,690
153.

171
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,590
154.

172
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,390
155... 298.

173
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,290
299.

174
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,390
3... 300.

175
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,890
I've counted till 300.

176
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,990
Haibara!

177
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,880
Where are you, Haibara?

178
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
Haibara!

179
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,080
If I don't come out by the time you count to 300,

180
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,580
get out of here immediately.

181
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,680
If you run down the path of the forest,

182
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,380
you may luckily be saved.

183
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,580
No... no way.

184
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,980
I can't run away,

185
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,280
because I'm taking this bread to Conan.

186
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,380
I'm not scared.

187
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Where are you, Haibara?

188
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
Please answer me!

189
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,880
Haibara!

190
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,280
This is...

191
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,980
the restroom.

192
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Oh, Haibara?

193
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
No... no.

194
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,280
It's not Haibara.

195
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
I think he's gone away.

196
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,980
Why didn't you listen to me and flee?

197
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,380
You were saved only because I just happened

198
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,780
to be in the hidden door.

199
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,880
Otherwise, you would've been killed by now!

200
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,380
But...

201
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,080
I can't run away alone,

202
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,280
knowing that you may all be in danger.

203
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,180
Goodness, what a girl.

204
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,780
Now, wipe your tears,

205
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,980
and let's set off to look for everyone.

206
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,080
Okay.

207
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,880
Where's Mitsuhiko?

208
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,080
I wonder.

209
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,680
If he came into this tower,

210
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,180
maybe he's been caught by the one we just encountered?

211
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,880
Oh, no.

212
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,480
Conan and the others are not here.

213
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,080
What did you do with your Youth Detective badges?

214
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,680
Oh, the battery ran out, so we gave it to Dr. Agasa.

215
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,280
I see.

216
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, look. There's someone there.

217
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
See, over there.

218
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,880
Skeleton!

219
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,480
This is...

220
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,280
It's been a skeleton for quite some time.

221
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,680
But, judging from the dust on it,

222
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,580
it's been put here not too long ago.

223
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,380
He seems to be the one who carved the letters on the stairs.

224
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,580
It was probably moved here because Conan found it.

225
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,880
But, who is this person, anyway?

226
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,580
Only the bones of the feet are much narrower than the other parts.

227
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,380
Besides, the teeth look like it's been grinding quite a bit.

228
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,080
And, the length of the hair, maybe a woman?

229
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,980
Don't tell me that the person who is pretending to be her is...

230
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,980
What's the matter, little ladies?

231
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,980
I heard voices so I came to check.

232
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,580
Oh? Where is your other friend?

233
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,980
We're in great trouble!

234
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,880
All of my friends were captured by a bad person and...

235
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,580
Haibara!

236
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,880
Hey, we have to take the old lady along too,

237
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
or she'll be attacked by the bad person!

238
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,580
What're you talking about?

239
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,380
She's the one who attacked you a while ago!

240
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,480
What?

241
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,780
The bone of the corpse was of somebody

242
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,680
who hadn't walked for a long time!

243
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,380
Considering the sex and age,

244
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,780
there is no doubt that the corpse was that of Mrs. Mamiya!

245
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,380
Then, who is the one we just saw?

246
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,880
An impostor who had switched herself with Mrs. Mamiya.

247
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
She got plastic surgery to look just like Mrs. Mamiya,

248
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,780
and as for little details she feigned being senile.

249
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,680
She carried it out on the day of the fire!

250
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,380
She probably thought she couldn't keep deceiving

251
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Mrs. Mamiya's daughter that she burned her to death!

252
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
If she knew of the existence of this underground path,

253
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,780
she could've committed arson without anybody knowing,

254
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,980
as well as sneak out,

255
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,580
get plastic surgery and come back!

256
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
She's probably after the treasure in this castle.

257
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,680
Right. She found out that my purpose for coming here

258
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,980
was the treasure and almost fired me.

259
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,980
So, I switched places with her.

260
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,380
Being that my voice sounded like hers to begin with.

261
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,880
Don't worry.

262
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,680
I won't keep you down in the dark underground

263
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,980
like I did that old lady.

264
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
I'll let you faint and then line you out

265
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,580
in the forest with your friends after 2 or 3 days.

266
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,680
After your cheeks lose their plumpness and become super slim!

267
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,780
Cut it out.

268
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,580
Drastic dieting is not good for kids.

269
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,680
Right!

270
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,380
Those two are just fine the way they are!

271
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Right, right!

272
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,480
It's healthier to eat until your stomach's full!

273
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,780
All of you...

274
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,480
How did you guys?

275
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,580
Thanks to Mitsuhiko.

276
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,280
He used the pursuit function of my glasses,

277
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,180
to detect our location by the transmission waves that were

278
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,280
being emitted by the badges of the Detective Squad

279
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,180
that Doc had on him!

280
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Darn...

281
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,080
It's no use trying to get away.

282
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,280
Housekeeper whose whereabouts was unknown,

283
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,780
Miss Mutsumi Nishikawa!

284
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,680
I called a friend who is a plastic surgeon

285
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,480
and discovered your identity right away.

286
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,280
I asked him, "Do you remember any weird patient who came"

287
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,580
"and asked you to turn her into an old lady?"

288
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Which means you guys so saw the corpse too.

289
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,680
I didn't have to look at the corpse

290
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,280
to tell that you were an impostor.

291
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,080
There is no way that Mrs. Mamiya who has never left the house,

292
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
nor taken a trip anywhere, could've possibly

293
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
felt inconvenienced by the size of the passport

294
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,580
that was changed 6 years ago.

295
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,180
Although I couldn't figure out that

296
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,180
you traveled abroad several times to maintain that face of ours.

297
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,380
I'd like to compliment you for disclosing my true identity,

298
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,280
but you couldn't possibly capture me,

299
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,480
because I have this underground wired.

300
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,780
Huh? Are you going to run away?

301
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,480
I know how to get to the aisle that you were looking

302
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,980
for all this time.

303
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,580
What? Don't tell me you uncoded

304
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,380
the code hidden in the chess pieces in the yard?

305
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,480
Yeah! Chess pieces are usually designated

306
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,580
by the letters "A" to "H", and the numbers "1" to "8"!

307
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,680
Judging from the position of the Knight,

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,180
the correct way to view the chess board

309
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,080
is from the stoned pavement.

310
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,580
Viewing it from that direction...

311
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,780
If you read it off in order, it goes...

312
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:43,780
E-G-G-H-E-A-D, "Egg head"

313
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,980
which means argumentative intellectual.

314
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,280
Yes, it's about Sir Mamiya who thought tip the code.

315
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,880
All you have to do next is turn the portrait in the direction

316
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,280
designated by the black pieces, which is left.

317
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,680
The entrance to the secret aisle will open up.

318
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,980
Oh, having served in this castle for 20 years.

319
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,380
I finally get to see the treasure that I've been seeking.

320
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm not letting anybody have it. Not anybody!

321
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,380
Oh! On the other side of the glittering door...

322
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,580
is my treasure!

323
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,080
This is my treasure?

324
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
Where is it?

325
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,580
It's written on the door, isn't it?

326
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
"I'll give this beautiful scenery of the castle"

327
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,980
"to the first one who arrives here," it says.

328
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,680
Ridiculous...

329
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,680
You mean I killed many just for something like this?

330
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,580
For something like this,

331
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,080
I changed my face to an ugly old woman...

332
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
For... for something like this?

333
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,780
An hour later, the police arrived

334
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,580
and she was taken away.

335
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,980
A truly old woman who has lost her soul,

336
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,080
a wretched sight.

337
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,880
Sir Mitsuru was disappointed about the treasure of the castle,

338
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,580
but, his son Takahito seemed to be relieved

339
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,480
at hearing that the killer was arrested.

340
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,180
It seems that he was suspicious about the fire

341
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,780
that broke out 4 years ago,

342
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,680
and was searching around in secret.

343
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
That hidden aisle

344
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,080
was something that came with the castle to begin with,

345
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,980
and Sir Mamiya being a historian,

346
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,380
made a complete replica of it when he rebuilt the castle.

347
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,480
This castle sure was a lot of fun!

348
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,280
It was really thrilling and full of suspense indeed!

349
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,580
Very true!

350
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,880
Hey...

351
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,980
Conan and I were hit and knocked out, you know.

352
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,180
Oh, Sir Takahito says he'll prepare breakfast for all of you!

353
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,480
Eat before you leave! You, with the glasses,

354
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,780
you haven't eaten anything since last night, have you?

355
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,280
No thanks, we got food supply for camp in the car too.

356
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,780
And besides, for me, this bread is more than a feast!

357
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,680
Oh, I think I'll accept the invitation, then.

358
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,080
Me too!

359
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,480
Hey...
