1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,310
The House of Hope.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,610
Six young people once inhabited it.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,989
However, three years ago,

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
ever since one of the women out of the six,

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,993
died due to a heart attack,

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:18,410
people began calling the House of Hope, the House of Death.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,610
The only man who remained living in the house alone

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,001
called Mr. Shusaku Akashi

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,510
was the husband of Aoi, the woman who died.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,510
Mr. Akashi had been locked up

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,009
in one of the rooms of the house by someone

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,011
and left to starve to death.

13
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:36,410
Just before Mr. Akashi died, he left a queer message behind.

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,010
One side of the wall in the room was entirely painted red.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,710
Moreover, a chair painted white faced the red wall,

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,010
while a chair painted black

17
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,110
faced the white wall on the opposite side

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,510
and both were nailed to the floor.

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,710
Mr. Akashi was found dead sitting in the white chair.

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,037
Rival of Inspector Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

21
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,710
Inspector Takaaki Morofushi

22
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,510
better known as Inspector Koume of the local police station

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,045
and we, ended up working to solve the mystery together, but...

24
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:10,049
What on earth is the red wall trying to relay?

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,710
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,410
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,010
Suspects of various color.

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,410
The incident heads in an unexpected direction

29
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,061
with the occurrence of a second case.

30
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,210
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,067
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,575
He offered flowers?

34
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:13,375
Oh, I forgot to mention it,

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,175
but Inspector Morofushi and Inspector Yamato

36
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:20,179
were classmates with Aoi who died in this warehouse three years ago.

37
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,975
-Class... -Classmates?

38
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:26,475
Inspector Morofushi was classmates with Ms. Aoi Kobashi

39
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:29,975
who passed away in the warehouse of this house three years ago?

40
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,191
Is it just a coincidence that the same inspector turns out

41
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:36,475
to be the one to first discover the corpse of Mr. Shusaku Akashi?

42
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:43,575
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Mercy)"

43
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,205
I stopped over here

44
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,775
because that day happened to be the memorial date of her death.

45
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,875
I came to offer her flowers and was about to go home

46
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,275
when I noticed that below that window, that was cracked,

47
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,475
a lot of paint was scattered about,

48
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:56,875
so I got suspicious.

49
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,175
I rang the doorbell but got no answer,

50
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,175
so I went to the front door that wasn't locked

51
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,575
and went inside together with him

52
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:07,575
then found the corpse that was locked up in the room.

53
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:10,975
But I heard that the fingerprints of the victim

54
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:13,975
were found on the scattered paints.

55
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,975
Yeah. On every one of them.

56
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:20,575
But on the doorknob of the room and the spray can,

57
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:23,775
the fingerprints of your subordinate were found.

58
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:27,575
It's indeed like bamboo shoots in the snow.

59
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,175
Very interesting.

60
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,475
Huh, bamboo shoots in the know?

61
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,675
It's not in the know, but in the snow.

62
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,875
He said, bamboo shoots in the snow.

63
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,475
Why would bamboo shoots appear here?

64
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,775
Bamboo shoots appear in spring, right?

65
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:45,375
That's why in China, when something impossible happens

66
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,175
or when you get hold of something that is really hard to get,

67
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,475
that phrase is used!

68
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:52,275
But, what's impossible?

69
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,975
Can't you tell?

70
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,975
The victim was locked up in this room, you know.

71
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:58,975
He would naturally place his hands on the doorknob

72
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:01,575
attempting to go outside, wouldn't he?

73
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:05,075
The fingerprints of the victim should also be found on the spray can

74
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,175
that he used to paint the wall red too, right?

75
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,475
Besides, the very person who locked him in here

76
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,475
doesn't look to have returned here!

77
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,375
True.

78
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,775
And, the victim's fingerprints

79
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,297
not being found where they should've been

80
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,575
could mean that the culprit had to wipe them off for some reason.

81
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,075
Or...

82
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,303
At any rate,

83
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:28,575
maybe it may be a good idea to meet with the four

84
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:31,075
who used to live here before.

85
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,375
This time, we should con then into talking.

86
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,175
Go see them yourself if you want to!

87
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,075
And, while you're at it,

88
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:44,323
keep that eyesore brat and girl in your car for a while.

89
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,675
In the meantime, I want to get my head together

90
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:49,775
with the Sleeping Kogoro that I called all the way out here

91
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,331
and find out what really happened in order to solve the case!

92
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:58,337
Things that I wouldn't want kids to hear about may come up too.

93
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:03,975
Well, after you meet the four, drop the kid and the girl over at my house,

94
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,345
when you come back to report what you found.

95
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:09,775
Although I don't think you'll get much.

96
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:28,775
And? Shall we start talking about the case...

97
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,371
Hey, he's sleeping!

98
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,875
That's why Kan-chan sent Conan along with him.

99
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,075
"Midorikawa"

100
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:57,375
You're the inspector I met the other day.

101
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,175
I've told you everything I know about Shusaku who passed away.

102
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:02,401
The thing is,

103
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:06,075
your fingerprints were found on the doorknob of the room

104
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,875
that Shusaku was locked up in.

105
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:13,875
But, six years have already gone by since I've lived there.

106
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,975
Fingerprints that old can still be detected?

107
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:21,075
Which means that you haven't been back to that place

108
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,175
since you left six years ago?

109
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,775
-Right. -Don't, Conan.

110
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,375
What's with them? These children.

111
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:34,433
Well, I'm taking care of them for a while, you see.

112
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,575
I told you, didn't I? To stay in the car.

113
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:43,375
Because I've got to tell Pops what kind of people you are.

114
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,475
I don't mean to be rude,

115
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,775
but you appear on TV a lot, don't you?

116
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,775
Huh? Yes.

117
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:53,375
Maybe the name Naoki Sone sounds better?

118
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,475
Oh! I know that name!

119
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,175
You appear as the bad guy in samurai movies.

120
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:02,475
Sone is my mother's maiden name.

121
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,975
So, I changed my pen name to it.

122
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:08,975
When I was living in that house, I was called Midori,

123
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:11,575
so I figured that if I didn't change my name,

124
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,975
I couldn't stand on my own two feet after leaving the house.

125
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:17,875
So, you were called by color by the people who lived in that house.

126
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,075
Yeah.

127
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:21,875
But since Shusaku and I were childhood friends,

128
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,475
we called each other by our names.

129
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:37,975
"Yamabuki Design"

130
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,075
Oh my. My fingerprints

131
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:43,175
were found on the doorknob of Mr. Akashi's room?

132
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,475
Why, of course,

133
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:49,075
because I used to live there before, after all!

134
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,875
If you used to call Mr. Akashi Aka,

135
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,513
then he must've called you Yamabuki?

136
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,675
Yes. After all, that's my name as is.

137
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:02,275
But, I think that only Ao-chan used to call me Yama-chan.

138
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,575
That person called Aoi, what kind of person was she?

139
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:09,275
Well, to put it flatly, she was everyone's madonna.

140
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:12,175
After all, she was the only woman among the six of us,

141
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,175
and beautiful too.

142
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:17,175
That's why when we found out that she was going with Akashi,

143
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:19,475
we were all surprised.

144
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,575
That's why everyone left that house.

145
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,275
It goes for me too.

146
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,075
I see.

147
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,275
"Studio Momo"

148
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,559
Huh?

149
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,075
My fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Aka's room?

150
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:47,275
Hey, don't tell me that you're suspecting me an inhabitant

151
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,775
that once lived there because of something like that?

152
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,571
I mean, who knows when it got there in the first place!

153
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,675
No. I'm only confirming just in case.

154
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:59,275
Did everyone used to call you Momo, sir?

155
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,475
Yeah. I hated it

156
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,583
because there was a dork who used to call me Pink at times!

157
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,375
Pink...

158
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:11,375
Which means that you never went back to the house after leaving it?

159
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,975
Oh, I forgot to mention it.

160
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:17,475
I went there once about four years ago

161
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:20,975
to deliver a game software that I helped create.

162
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:23,175
A game software?

163
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:26,975
Yeah. It was just a simple chess game.

164
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:31,275
Aka and Ao-chan both liked chess so...

165
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,775
What?

166
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:49,375
My fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Aka's room?

167
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,629
Yes.

168
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,275
That's why I'm only confirming just in case.

169
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,975
That can't be...

170
00:10:55,975 --> 00:11:00,175
I mean I used to live there before too.

171
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,175
Oh! Wait!

172
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,375
I dropped by the house about six months ago.

173
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:09,675
At that time, I may have touched Aka's art tools too.

174
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:12,651
Oh, Aka stands for Akashi, that's the way everyone called him.

175
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,375
Then, were you called White, sir?

176
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,275
Yeah.

177
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,775
I was never called by my last name!

178
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:23,375
Oh, no, I've got to go to a meeting with my band members!

179
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,775
May I be excused?

180
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,975
I've got to get going!

181
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:30,675
Then, see you later.

182
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,681
Yeah. It's me.

183
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,975
I see.

184
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,575
You conned everyone into talking by telling them

185
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:57,675
that their fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Akashi's room.

186
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,875
And? Did you get anything?

187
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,275
Yes. Well...

188
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:04,075
There is! A person who's really suspicious!

189
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,575
He was really flustered

190
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,575
and even volunteered to remark that he touched the art goods

191
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:10,275
when he visited although he wasn't questioned about it!

192
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,275
Who's that guy?

193
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,175
Mr. Shiro Naoki!

194
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,375
Shiro Naoki?

195
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,275
Come to think of it,

196
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,719
when we went to ask him questions the last time,

197
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,775
-he acted really uncomfortable, didn't he? -Yeah.

198
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,775
I had my eyes on him too.

199
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:28,175
But, I had no concrete evidence either.

200
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,275
Well, it's already late tonight.

201
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,375
Let's hit the sack tonight and then at the break of day,

202
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:37,375
let's have Shiro Naoki come to the police station voluntarily.

203
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:51,375
What? You found out who starved Shusaku Akashi to death?

204
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,475
-Seriously? -Yeah.

205
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,175
After sleeping one night and thinking things out,

206
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,175
an idea flashed through my mind!

207
00:12:57,175 --> 00:13:00,175
And? Who is it, the culprit?

208
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:04,775
It's the one you said was weird last night, Shiro Naoki.

209
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:08,375
The victim Mr. Akashi was sitting in the white chair

210
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,769
and right in front of him is the red wall.

211
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,773
In other words, the red color was meant to indicate himself!

212
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,475
Then, what about the black chair?

213
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:19,175
Black of course refers to the culprit!

214
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:22,075
What can the man see sitting in the black chair?

215
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:25,075
Oh! The white wall! I see!

216
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,785
He wanted to tell us that the culprit

217
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,575
was Mr. Shiro Naoki who was called, White.

218
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,575
Exactly.

219
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:34,175
I hate to put your words right back into your mouth.

220
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:36,795
-But that deduction... -Let him be, Uehara.

221
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,475
It's too much trouble.

222
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:39,775
But...

223
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,575
What the... in front of the apartment...

224
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,575
Is something wrong?

225
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,075
Kan-chan, that...

226
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,275
Koume?

227
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,875
Inspector Morofushi.

228
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,175
Hey. Don't tell me...

229
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,875
Yes. I had this strange ominous feeling inside of me

230
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,875
and rushed over here...

231
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,975
And this is what I saw.

232
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,875
Red... red wall.

233
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,575
He probably saw our moves last night

234
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:26,845
and quickly decided to take the upper hand.

235
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,975
Move as swift as a wind?

236
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,575
Yes. Something you have a hold of

237
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:35,775
may not really be what you have a hold of.

238
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,275
He beat us to it.

239
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,475
Huh? Let's drink shochu,

240
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,175
let's make sure to drink potato shochu. (Japanese rhyme)

241
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:42,861
Oh, it's...

242
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,863
Something you have a hold of

243
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,975
may not really be what you have a hold of.

244
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,275
Just because you have something in the palm of your hand,

245
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,475
it doesn't necessarily mean you can grasp it for sure.

246
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,875
Huh?

247
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,375
In other words, we were off our guard

248
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,675
and had the man who carried the key to solving this case murdered

249
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,275
right before our eyes

250
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:06,175
and lost the clue we could've had!

251
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,447
The man who was killed

252
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,047
was Mr. Shiro Naoki, age 36, a musician.

253
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,047
The estimated time of death

254
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,901
is last night between 10:00 to 11:00.

255
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:28,247
The cause of death is suffocation due to strangulation.

256
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:31,447
Judging from the fact that the victim was made to sit in a chair

257
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,913
and that in front of that chair there

258
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,547
was a closet with a door painted red

259
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:40,547
with a spray can that was found on the floor near the feet of the victim.

260
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,347
It is highly likely that the culprit is the same man

261
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:44,923
who confined Shusaku Akashi in his room

262
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:48,447
and starved him to death.

263
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,247
A red wall. Again.

264
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:53,647
Which means that

265
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:56,935
this red wall is again a dying message left behind by the victim.

266
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:58,647
No.

267
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,847
In order for Mr. Shiro Naoki to have painted the wall red,

268
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,943
he would've had to do it before he was strangled to death.

269
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,347
And again,

270
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,747
it's hard to believe that he would leave this room

271
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:12,947
in such a weird condition before he met the culprit here.

272
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:15,747
Then, what with this red wall...

273
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:16,747
Don't tell me...

274
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:20,247
Yes. I'm sure the culprit deliberately painted the wall red.

275
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,647
Hey, isn't it strange?

276
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:26,965
Why would the culprit leave a dying message indicating who he is behind?

277
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,647
He's making fun of us, the police!

278
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:30,969
Yes.

279
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:32,971
It could be that he re-did the red wall incident

280
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:35,847
that Mr. Akashi left behind at this site

281
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,547
in order to challenge us.

282
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:43,447
"Come solve this mystery, and catch me if you can"

283
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,647
At any rate, it's clear now that

284
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,987
the suspect is a former resident of that house

285
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,847
where Shusaku Akashi used to live.

286
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:54,547
Actor Naoki Midorikawa

287
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:58,047
and fashion designer Shoji Yamabuki.

288
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:02,647
CG creator, Takuto Momose. One of them did it.

289
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,003
Why?

290
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:10,647
We've only told those three and Mr. Naoki who was killed

291
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:13,747
about the wall being painted red

292
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:17,447
and the fact that Mr. Akashi was seated in a chair.

293
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:23,021
But, we haven't said anything about

294
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,047
Mr. Akashi having been seated in a white chair,

295
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,027
and that there was a black chair behind it,

296
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,747
with both chairs being nailed to the floor.

297
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,047
Although the culprit tried to re-do

298
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,647
the site where Mr. Akashi starved to death,

299
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:39,447
it seems that all he could do was make him sit in the seat.

300
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:43,047
I wonder if the culprit got scared.

301
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,647
Because he tried to copy the dying message,

302
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,047
despite not knowing much about it!

303
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,547
I guess so.

304
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:54,247
Well, I'd like to go ask the three

305
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:59,447
where and what they were doing between 10:00 to 11:00 last night.

306
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,747
I want to discuss the truth of this incident

307
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,447
with Sleeping Kogoro here so...

308
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:06,847
Koume, I hate to trouble you

309
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:11,069
but will you keep that kid and girl in your car again...

310
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:15,447
If you warn someone for their own good,

311
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:17,947
but they refuse to listen, say no more and let them be.

312
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,847
That way, you don't have to embarrass yourself.

313
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:21,847
Huh?

314
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,047
Kansuke, it seems that

315
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:28,547
you want me to work together with that good-looking lad.

316
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:31,089
But, I guess I'll refuse this time.

317
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:35,547
I will go and investigate on my own.

318
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,847
But, of course I give you my word that as soon as I solve the case,

319
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:43,101
I will report it to you first thing.

320
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:45,747
Bye.

321
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:49,747
Gosh.

322
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,847
Hey, what was that thing just now

323
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:56,147
about a warning or something?

324
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:59,747
If I remember correctly, those are the words of Confucius.

325
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:02,047
When someone does wrong,

326
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:04,847
it's okay to warn of the wrongdoing with justice at heart.

327
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,947
But, if it proves futile, let it be.

328
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:11,547
Being too persistent will end up in yourself having to feel bad,

329
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:12,747
and will be ineffective.

330
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,447
I think that's what it means?

331
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,747
But what is the wrongdoing?

332
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,147
Remember, about the time when Kan-chan was pursuing a case,

333
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,547
and was struck by an avalanche.

334
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,547
He hurt his left eye and left leg at that time

335
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:26,647
and his whereabouts became unknown?

336
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:30,447
Back then we weren't able to contact Kan-chan for days,

337
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:33,647
but Inspector Morofushi ignored his superior's orders,

338
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:36,347
went over to a police with jurisdiction in a different prefecture

339
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:38,147
and pursued the culprit that Kan-chan was going after

340
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,547
with aggressive investigation, took custody of him,

341
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,747
then made him spit out that they were struck by an avalanche

342
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:45,163
and found Kan-chan in the hospital!

343
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:47,547
He had to take responsibility for what happened then

344
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:50,447
and was transferred to a local police station.

345
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,847
He owes him for that time too, so...

346
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:54,647
I think Kan-chan's trying to team him up with the boy

347
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,447
so that Morofushi won't go off again on his own

348
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,947
making rash investigations.

349
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:03,181
I mean, because you're really smart, Conan.

350
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:07,185
But he just investigated aggressively back then

351
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:10,447
because he wanted to find you as soon as possible.

352
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:11,647
In the case of this incident, this time...

353
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,191
There's a chance that

354
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,547
he may plunge into aggressive investigation!

355
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,747
Do you know?

356
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:19,547
About the book titled "Koume of 2nd grade class A".

357
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:22,047
Oh, I've read it before.

358
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,147
It's a story about a renown detective classmate

359
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:27,947
solving queer incidents that occur, right?

360
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:30,747
The author of that book is Aoi Kobashi

361
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:34,347
who died in the warehouse of that house three years ago,

362
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,347
as well as being Shusaku Akashi's wife!

363
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:37,215
What?

364
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:44,747
And, making an appearance in that book

365
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:48,347
is a model figure of the detective, her classmate.

366
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,347
Takaaki Morofushi!

367
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:54,747
Come to think of it,

368
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:57,247
a detective from the classroom next door

369
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:59,947
who spoke roughly also appeared...

370
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:01,247
Could that have been...

371
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,241
I'm pretty sure that the model was Kan-chan.

372
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,847
At any rate,

373
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,847
if these serial killings were committed

374
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:11,547
because of a grudge against Aoi Kobashi's death,

375
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:15,647
Koume will at all costs get right to solving the case!

376
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,247
He still really treasures that book

377
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:22,647
and even keeps it in his glove compartment.

378
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:26,747
Uehara!

379
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,267
Hail a cab and go after Koume's car!

380
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,447
I'm going with Kogoro to meet the three in question!

381
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:33,647
Yes, sir.

382
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:35,273
I know you already know,

383
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,447
but don't take your eye off Koume even for a second.

384
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,247
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:45,947
If you don't want him to get carried away in his investigation,

386
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:48,447
you should just go with him.

387
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,289
I think he wants to watch him in hiding.

388
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,747
Last night when we went to look over the place

389
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,047
where Inspector Morofushi and the suspects were,

390
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,647
there was a strange car following us too.

391
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:02,147
That's a car from the police, right?

392
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:03,301
Yeah.

393
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,447
But why would you want to keep watch?

394
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,847
We just told you that the three in question

395
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:13,047
knew about the red wall that was left behind at the scene, right?

396
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:18,347
Of course, we police personnel know of the facts.

397
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:21,847
Moreover, if that guy liked Aoi Kobashi

398
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:24,047
and worked in the police station,

399
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,247
wouldn't it be natural to keep watch over him?

400
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:28,447
Then, don't tell me...

401
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,847
Yeah.

402
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:34,847
Takaaki Morofushi is also a suspect!

403
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,423
"Surgical gown"

405
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,425
According to my deduction, the culprit

406
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,427
is the one with the color "black" in his name!

407
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,780
-No such person's made an appearance. -What?
