1
00:00:02,225 --> 00:00:03,983
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:06,525
You must be true to yourself.

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,425
Screams echo throughout the haunted house!

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,625
What was supposed to be an act turns into reality.

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,991
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:13,993
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:16,725
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,394 --> 00:02:03,094
"Screaming Operation Room (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:07,094
"Beika University Summer Festival"

10
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:11,094
The light music club concert will start from 15:00!

11
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:12,894
How about some famed mountain hut style

12
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:15,794
fried noodles of the Wandervogel club?

13
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:20,994
Entry number 5, English major Ms. Alisa Arisugawa!

14
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,123
Don't break the set!

15
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:26,694
What're we going to do about evening performance?

16
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:29,594
How about some cold drinks?

17
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:32,594
We're loading two more Adamski type UFOs!

18
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:34,694
Okay!

19
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,794
The costume play photo studio is open!

20
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:38,494
Please come!

21
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,194
Let me introduce to you!

22
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,794
An OB of Beika University as well as a famed detective.

23
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,494
Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

24
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:48,147
Hello!

25
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,694
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

26
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:53,494
How does it feel, visiting your alma mater after a long while?

27
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,294
Do you feel nostalgic?

28
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:56,694
Yes, sort of.

29
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:00,159
The school building is as rundown as was always, though.

30
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,394
But...

31
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:04,163
There are so many beauties here.

32
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:12,171
Geez, since he said he was going to give a lecture at his alma mater,

33
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,694
I came to look in on things,

34
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,494
and sure enough, all he was after was the girl students here!

35
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:18,177
Well, I guess it's not all that bad

36
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:22,181
to spread your wings freely at times in places like these, no?

37
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,194
The only thing that's spread long is the space under his nose.

38
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:29,294
And? Did you get to spread you wings in London, Ran?

39
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:32,794
You wrote me that you coincidentally ran into Shinichi, right?

40
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:35,494
Yeah, sort of.

41
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:40,194
Don't tell me you two did things you weren't supposed to do?

42
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:41,794
Just what do you mean by that?

43
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,994
Talking about London...

44
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:47,294
Shut up! I wish you'd stay out of it!

45
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,694
This is a story of adults that have nothing to do with brats!

46
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:53,294
Yes, it has everything to do with me.

47
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:57,494
Well, I guess when it comes to that Holmes freak,

48
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:01,094
he ended up talking your ears off about Holmes, right?

49
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:03,694
Well...

50
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,394
The thing is...

51
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:07,894
What?

52
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:10,794
Shinichi confessed that he loves you?

53
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:14,233
Keep your voice down, Sonoko!

54
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:19,494
Oh, so the time's finally come around for him to settle down.

55
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:23,894
But, if under those circumstances, rather than confess...

56
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,894
Can't you tell?

57
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:29,394
You're a detective, aren't you?

58
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,794
If so, why don't you at least deduce what's going on inside of me!

59
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,594
You dumb-dumb!

60
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:38,257
Hey, hold it, Ran!

61
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:41,494
Wait, I said!

62
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,794
Hey!

63
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,094
No. Let me go!

64
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:47,494
You're a nuisance!

65
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:48,894
What?

66
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:52,271
You're a nuisance of a difficult case to solve!

67
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,694
You've got so much unnecessary emotions mixed up inside of you,

68
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,294
that I wouldn't be able to make you out

69
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:58,594
even if I were Holmes himself!

70
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:01,194
I could never accurately make out

71
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:04,694
the feelings of a girl I care for!

72
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:21,194
It seems as if you pressured him into confessing how he felt.

73
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,694
I guess so.

74
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:27,194
And? You answered truthfully too, didn't you, Ran?

75
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,494
Answered... what?

76
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:33,594
No joke. I don't believe it.

77
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,315
I loved you all this time too.

78
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:37,894
Like this?

79
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,594
Of course I wouldn't say something like that.

80
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:45,094
I mean, should I have said something too?

81
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,894
Why, of course!

82
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:48,594
If you're not clear about it,

83
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:52,331
he may think that he was brushed off or something.

84
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,333
Idiot.

85
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,094
It was obvious at that point.

86
00:05:57,094 --> 00:06:00,094
If you're going to tell him, tell him right now on the phone!

87
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,894
-I'll watch you while you do! -What?

88
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:05,994
Hey, are you calling now?

89
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:10,349
Then, I would like to tell you the story of the 108 bags

90
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,894
that are indispensible for detectives!

91
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:14,894
The first is a wisdom bag!

92
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:16,355
Geez.

93
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,594
At this rate, who knows when he'll finish talking.

94
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,094
I mean after hearing that a detective was coming,

95
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:24,363
I wanted him to take a look and then.

96
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,594
Oh, I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

97
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:31,394
Did you want to see my father about something?

98
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:33,594
Could it be that you want him to investigate a case?

99
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,394
No. That's not it but...

100
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:40,379
If you're his daughter, do you go to investigate cases at times?

101
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,594
-Yes, at times. -Well, very frequently!

102
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:48,794
Then, you've seen it, haven't you?

103
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,389
What?

104
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,894
"Screaming Hospital"

105
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,393
Go inside that haunted house

106
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,194
to check out how well the zombie is made?

107
00:06:57,194 --> 00:07:00,894
Yeah. I think that someone who has been

108
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,394
to the actual scene of a crime many times

109
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,794
would be able to evaluate the looks of things more realistically!

110
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,394
Oh, well...

111
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,394
But...

112
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,494
The fact is, we belong to the department of literature and fine arts

113
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,413
and are majoring in the art of imagery!

114
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,894
We're shooting a horror movie as our graduation production

115
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,894
but we were told by a nagging broad who thinks

116
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:21,394
she's some big shot director that the scene

117
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:24,694
where a person dies, doesn't look real enough.

118
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,425
So, we told her to show us

119
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,427
a sample of what she's talking about.

120
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:33,194
Are you talking about me?

121
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:40,439
Who are these children?

122
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,441
When's the Sleeping Kogoro coming?

123
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:47,594
So, we've brought his daughter and her friend over!

124
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:51,294
Because she seems to have seen corpses at murder sites.

125
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:54,453
Okay, then, Go tell your father how you felt looking at it

126
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:57,594
and bring him here later, will you?

127
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:02,461
Anna! It's about time we shift!

128
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,463
Hey, what's with you, Mutsumi?

129
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,465
You don't even have your make-up on yet!

130
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,467
Because even if I were to do it myself,

131
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,894
you're going to fix it, aren't you, Anna?

132
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:12,994
That's why I thought it'd be better

133
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,473
if you did it for me to begin with.

134
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,594
Geez, talk about a hopeless case!

135
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:20,994
Okay, we'll let them in in 30 minutes, then!

136
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:23,694
You want to show them the part you're playing the zombie,

137
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,194
while you're at it anyway, don't you?

138
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,094
Okay!

139
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:31,094
Take a good look at the way I look dead, then!

140
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:38,194
So, she says...

141
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:41,194
Oh, no, I'm not going inside!

142
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:44,794
Don't worry about it! They're all only props after all!

143
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:49,394
But you were shocked a while ago too, weren't you, Sonoko?

144
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,511
That was just because I was taken by surprise.

145
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:55,694
That's what a haunted house is all about, isn't it?

146
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:57,294
Ran! Being the way you are,

147
00:08:57,294 --> 00:09:00,894
you won't be able to tell Shinichi that you like him forever!

148
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,894
That's why you see!

149
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,794
Do it to conjure up some guts in you!

150
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,694
If you clear this, no doubt you'll step up

151
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,894
to becoming a woman stronger than you are now!

152
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,533
You think so?

153
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,894
That's totally out of this world.

154
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,994
You can say that again.

155
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:26,545
See.

156
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
It's looks like fun.

157
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,194
It doesn't look like fun at all!

158
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,294
If you're that scared, I can escort you inside.

159
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:37,294
After all, he knows where what gadgets are set.

160
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:40,094
Okay, please do!

161
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:42,194
Then, she'll go inside too!

162
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:44,094
Hey, Sonoko!

163
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:45,794
Don't worry!

164
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,794
It's only the beginning that's really scary!

165
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:49,594
Gosh...

166
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:03,694
"Entrance"

167
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:21,994
Hey, this is just the beginning.

168
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:24,394
Don't get lost, sonny!

169
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,594
How the heck can I get lost?

170
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,294
I'm being carried right through.

171
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:34,613
Well, it's pretty well made for a school festival haunted house.

172
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,894
It's of bad taste, though.

173
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:42,094
I'd like to have shown this to Hashiguchi too.

174
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:45,394
Yeah. After all, Hashiguchi's the one

175
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,627
who planned this graduation project haunted house

176
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,629
and the movie too!

177
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,994
Did that person quit school?

178
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,394
No.

179
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,994
He committed suicide by drinking poison.

180
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,894
It was only a month ago.

181
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,194
What?

182
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,643
It seems that he was told by the doctor

183
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,645
that he had an incurable disease

184
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,994
and that he had only six months more to live.

185
00:11:08,994 --> 00:11:11,594
He took it heavily and took his own life.

186
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:13,494
It was written in his suicide note.

187
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:16,655
Moreover, the ones who found his body are

188
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:22,094
we two, and Mutsumi and Anna who were just here a while ago.

189
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:26,665
I was haunted by nightmares for a while.

190
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,667
It was after his death,

191
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,694
that Anna started to get all worked up saying

192
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:31,794
she was going to offer it to Hashiguchi

193
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:34,673
and started really getting carried away with making the movie.

194
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,294
Isn't that right, Tsujiei?

195
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,994
Tsujiei?

196
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:40,679
Hey.

197
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:42,681
Where'd he disappear to?

198
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:46,194
He was here till a while ago, wasn't he?

199
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:49,894
I'll go look for him around here, so you guys go outside!

200
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:52,691
The exit is right up ahead!

201
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,693
What?

202
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:59,094
Straight up ahead.

203
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:02,294
It's so dark that you can hardly see anything.

204
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:07,594
There seems to be a surgery room.

205
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,794
Excuse me.

206
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,715
Wow.

207
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:19,194
It looks like a real surgery is being performed.

208
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,794
The patient is Anna that we saw a while ago.

209
00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:25,194
The doctors performing the surgery are all mannequins.

210
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:29,594
There's the exit.

211
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,394
I guess we can't go outside

212
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:34,394
unless we pass by the pillow of the bed.

213
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:35,994
Yes.

214
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:09,594
There's nothing to be so surprised about, is there?

215
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:12,194
Ladies.

216
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,094
That's right.

217
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:21,294
These are just props.

218
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,894
See!

219
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:26,394
You guys are too exaggeratedly terrified!

220
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,094
But, Anna's strange.

221
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:35,494
Yeah. Every time after she ejects blood,

222
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:39,694
she gets up, opens her eyes wide and laughs.

223
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:44,594
Hey, Anna. Let's not get lazy!

224
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:48,394
Weren't you going to show us your awesome death sight?

225
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,094
Hey. Come on, say something! Anna!

226
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:57,194
Hey. She doesn't seem to be breathing?

227
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,494
Hey, Anna?

228
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,294
Get a hold of yourself, Anna?

229
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:02,594
Anna?

230
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,823
What? Is something wrong?

231
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,494
The inside of her mouth smells like almonds.

232
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:10,194
Hey, Anna? Answer me, Anna?

233
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:11,394
Get out of the way!

234
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,094
I'll take Anna to the hospital.

235
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,494
Don't touch her!

236
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:19,194
There is smell of almond from inside her mouth!

237
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:22,494
She could've drank potassium cyanide poison!

238
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,994
Poison?

239
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,894
The smell of almond?

240
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:28,394
-Really? -Amateurs shouldn't smell it!

241
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,394
The almond smell is caused by the poison

242
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,294
that was drunk combining with stomach acids and stuff,

243
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,694
resulting in the smell of cyanide gas!

244
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:36,855
If you mistakenly sniff it in, you'll die!

245
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,794
I mean, I saw it on a police drama.

246
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:43,794
The almond smell is not the familiar one of the almond

247
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:46,594
that is usually sweet and aromatic,

248
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,194
but rather, the sweet sour smell of the almond fruit

249
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:50,894
and flower before harvest.

250
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:52,594
Oh.

251
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:56,875
But, from what it looks like now, Anna's...

252
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,877
committed suicide.

253
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,423
"Screaming Hospital"

254
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,223
Suicide?

255
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:12,323
Did she drink the poison in front of you all?

256
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,523
Yes, probably...

257
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:17,723
What is her name?

258
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,623
Beika University, Senior of

259
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:22,923
the Literature Department of Performing Fine Arts, Ms. Anna Tadami.

260
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,223
Is that correct?

261
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:26,905
Yeah.

262
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,223
Oh, well... because of her monster make-up,

263
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:32,911
the picture of her student ID that we found in her belongings

264
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,323
seemed so very different.

265
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:36,323
And?

266
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:37,923
What is your testimony

267
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,223
that Ms. Anna Tadami committed suicide based on?

268
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:42,523
She suddenly started to suffer!

269
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:45,423
We followed the guide board here...

270
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:49,323
And passed through the pillow of the bed like this.

271
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:52,623
Her body suddenly went into convulsion.

272
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:02,323
She was struggling kicking her legs up and down.

273
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:06,945
So much that the bed started shaking

274
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,523
making rattling sounds too!

275
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:11,923
Then, right after that blood gushed out of her stomach...

276
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:12,951
Blood?

277
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:16,323
Hey, wasn't the cause of her death toxication?

278
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:17,723
Oh, yes.

279
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,123
But since the coroner hasn't arrived yet,

280
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:22,323
we can't say for sure.

281
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:24,963
There is an almond smell coming from her mouth

282
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,965
and there is something that looks like a capsule

283
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,623
stuck between her teeth too.

284
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:30,523
She probably took poison.

285
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,623
The blood oozing out is done by a gadget.

286
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:34,123
A gadget?

287
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:37,323
There is a switch inside the bed.

288
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:39,323
And when you push it...

289
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:44,983
-Hey. -Oh, it splattered on you?

290
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,985
It usually flies over there!

291
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,023
But it's water based, so it'll wash off right away.

292
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:52,991
Then, was the bed shaking also done with a gadget?

293
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,923
Yes. It's a gadget alright but...

294
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,997
the top right leg of this bed

295
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,523
and the lower left leg that is diagonal to it,

296
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,423
is slightly short,

297
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,223
so when the person playing the patient

298
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,223
shakes the bed with his body,

299
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:12,323
the bed will sways.

300
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,323
If so, did she kick her legs up and down

301
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,015
-using some device too? -No.

302
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:22,023
That could've only been done by the person on the bed!

303
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,823
Oh, wait.

304
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,523
See, like so!

305
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,523
There's nothing here except for the gadget to eject blood!

306
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:32,223
Please do not touch things at the site without permission!

307
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:33,423
Right, right!

308
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:36,423
Those legs with red pedicure on them!

309
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,523
When kicked her legs up and down, they came into view, right?

310
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,823
Yes, the covers that were on her flipped up

311
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:45,043
and her right foot came into view.

312
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:49,047
I see. It seems to be true that

313
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,523
she drank the poison when Ran and Sonoko passed by her bed.

314
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:55,723
There was nobody around her at that time, was there?

315
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,023
Especially near her face.

316
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:01,923
Yes, it was dark, but I think only we were there.

317
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:03,823
If anyone made her drink poison,

318
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,423
I think we would've been able to see it.

319
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:08,523
By the way, when she started to suffer,

320
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:10,723
where were you both?

321
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,623
Us?

322
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:15,723
I was approaching the two girls secretly

323
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:17,723
wearing this on my chest.

324
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,823
I was with those children right through

325
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:22,523
as they're escort through this haunted house but...

326
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,323
I deliberately pulled away from them a while

327
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,323
to wear this simple item

328
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:28,623
to scare the girls in the operation room

329
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:31,089
as I talked over with Hacchiya.

330
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,091
Well, but after we separated,

331
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:36,123
I was doing different things from Tsujie.

332
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:37,723
Then, what about you?

333
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:41,099
I was in the X-Ray room next door.

334
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:46,023
I was waiting for people to come right through.

335
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:48,223
I see.

336
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:50,823
But, I heard a scream and despite it, no one came,

337
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:52,123
so I got anxious and...

338
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:54,223
Anxious?

339
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:55,623
Because...

340
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:57,623
In order to get out of here,

341
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,423
you have to first go through the operation room

342
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,423
and later pass through the X-ray room.

343
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:04,623
I came here to check things out, wondering what happened.

344
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,523
And saw that Anna... Anna...

345
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:09,823
Hey, Mutsumi, look at yourself!

346
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,023
Your make-up is all smeared with tears!

347
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,523
But, Anna died, you know!

348
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,523
I can't see how you can be so calm!

349
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,823
Of course we're not calm.

350
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:22,223
I feel the same way I felt when Hashiguchi committed suicide.

351
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:23,623
Suicide?

352
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,623
If you're officers, you already know, don't you?

353
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,523
The case about the Beika University Senior

354
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:28,523
who committed suicide

355
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:31,623
drinking poison in his apartment, a month ago.

356
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:33,623
Yeah. If I remember correctly,

357
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:36,023
it's the case where a classmate of his who coincidentally

358
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:38,523
dropped by found his body.

359
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:42,923
The classmates were me, Tsujiei, Mutsumi and

360
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:45,423
Anna, over here.

361
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:48,723
Hashiguchi was really into producing

362
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:51,169
the graduation project movie and yet...

363
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,323
He didn't come to class for a whole week.

364
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,123
We got worried and decided to

365
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:59,623
drop into his place after school one day.

366
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:05,183
But, there was no answer when we pushed the door bell.

367
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:07,823
So, we thought he was either asleep or out somewhere.

368
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,623
Therefore, we were talking about coming back some other time.

369
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,323
Anna suddenly...

370
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:14,423
I sense something is wrong!

371
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,923
Let's go ask the manager to open the door to the room!

372
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:20,223
And, so we got inside.

373
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:24,323
And found Mr. Hashiguchi who had poisoned himself to death?

374
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,723
Yes. In the suicide note that was written

375
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,023
in his handwriting that was left in the room,

376
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:30,023
the following was written.

377
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:31,723
I haven't been feeling well recently,

378
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,623
and was examined by a doctor.

379
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,823
I was told that I had osteogenic sarcoma that was pretty far gone,

380
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:38,123
and have only about six months to live.

381
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:40,423
I'll leave the rest to you

382
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:45,623
and cross over to the world beyond a step ahead of you both.

383
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:48,923
We heard from the officer later that

384
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:50,423
he died that day around the time

385
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:54,523
when we all took the seminar together.

386
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:58,323
It was from about that time that Anna changed, right?

387
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,239
Yeah. She suddenly said that she's going to make a tribute to Hashiguchi,

388
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:03,241
and started really working on the graduation project movie production

389
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,523
and putting her all into this haunted house too.

390
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,023
But, isn't it normal to want to carry things out

391
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,023
for the sake of a friend that had died?

392
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:13,023
But, she wasn't all that normal!

393
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,823
There was a time when she overdosed on sleeping pills

394
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:17,723
and was taken to the hospital too.

395
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:18,823
Her reason for this was that

396
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:21,023
she wanted to experience the in between of life and death

397
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,023
to use it as a realistic reference

398
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:24,023
for how she should play the role of being dead.

399
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:25,263
Am I correct?

400
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:28,423
Yeah. I thought that she was being quite reticent one day,

401
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:31,623
and found out that she had nails in her mouth one whole day.

402
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,271
Nails?

403
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,923
Maybe Anna

404
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:39,277
put the poison that was in the capsule into her mouth.

405
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,723
I see! Like she did the nails!

406
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:44,623
Then, she bit it accidentally.

407
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:46,823
And before she could experience what it's like to be

408
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,223
in between life and death,

409
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,623
she really ended up dead.

410
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:54,623
So, should we deem that she did commit suicide after all?

411
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:57,623
I wonder if it's really so?

412
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:01,723
Conan?

413
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:06,223
Because look at the cheek of that lady.

414
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:07,305
It's not make-up

415
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,923
but looks like she's really been scratched

416
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:12,623
and it looks like she's bleeding a bit too!

417
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,423
I think that somebody tried to cover her mouth

418
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:20,623
so she tried to pull away and ended up scratching herself.

419
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,321
What?

420
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,723
Inspector! Skin and blood were found in between her nails.

421
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:29,023
What?

422
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:32,323
This is a homicide made to look like suicide!

423
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:35,123
Who on earth poisoned Anna in the dark

424
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:37,335
and killed her?

425
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,800
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,198
"Pedicure"

427
00:24:06,198 --> 00:24:07,425
I've figured out who the culprit is.

428
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,966
Just as expected of the deduction queen!

429
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:10,760
Nothing's come out yet.
