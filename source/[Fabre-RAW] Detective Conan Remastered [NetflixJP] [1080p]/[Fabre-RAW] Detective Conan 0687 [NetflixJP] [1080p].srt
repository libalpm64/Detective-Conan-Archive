1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,738
Conan!

2
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:07,987
Ai!

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,338
Dr. Agasa!

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,138
Fantastic!

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,338
It's monster Gomera.

6
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:16,438
Beautiful.

7
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:18,338
It's sure made superbly.

8
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:21,738
It seems like their putting a lot of work into it this year.

9
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:23,138
Of course.

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,538
"Mika Itakura (27)" -It's been a long time, Dr. Agasa.

11
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:28,438
Mika.

12
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:32,011
All of you, she's Ms. Mika Itakura

13
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,638
who invited us here.

14
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:36,738
She's the executive chairperson of this festival.

15
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,238
Welcome to the Ice Festival.

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:40,738
Are you all enjoying yourselves?

17
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:42,038
Yes!

18
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,138
The two over there don't look too happy though.

19
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:48,027
Not true.

20
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,638
We are.

21
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:52,438
Ai is sort of a little snobbish at times, right?

22
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:54,738
Conan is sassy.

23
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:59,338
They both lack child like characteristics.

24
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:01,038
Oh, really?

25
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:05,738
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

26
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:08,047
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

27
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:09,638
The Ice Hotel where even the beds are made of ice.

28
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,538
What is the trick of the locked door murder?

29
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,138
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:15,238
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:17,738
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:05,238
"Unsolvable Ice Trap"

33
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:09,638
I've been friends with Mika's father from long before.

34
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:12,838
My father used to be the village head for this village before.

35
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,138
I'm sorry about your father, though.

36
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:19,438
Yes, well...

37
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:21,738
You mean your father...

38
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,183
e died of a traffice accident last year.

39
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,538
The brakes of the car he was driving malfunctioned.

40
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:33,838
What the... What's with that man?

41
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:36,838
Mr. Shiota.

42
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,207
Super cool!

43
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,938
Mr. Shiota is a great ice sculptor

44
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,138
who has credits of winning first prize at world tournaments.

45
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:02,538
-Awesome! -Awesome...

46
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:03,638
"Tetsuya Shiota (43)" -Thank you.

47
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:07,138
Comments straightforward like yours make me happiest.

48
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,438
Almost all the sculptures here

49
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,838
are made by Mr. Shiota.

50
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,438
I was able to become a sculptor

51
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,738
only thanks to the support I received from Mika's father.

52
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,838
This is just a little token of my appreciation.

53
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:22,638
Mr. Shiota.

54
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,638
Besides, I didn't make it all by myself.

55
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:29,138
I made it along with all the people of the village.

56
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:32,538
It sure looks as if the whole village cooperated.

57
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,738
Yes, everybody loves this festival.

58
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:39,638
Well, it'll all end this year though.

59
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:40,738
Village head, Mr. Yamaguchi.

60
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,638
"It'll end this year", just what does that mean?

61
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:46,265
"Taro Yamaguchi(61)" -I'm saying that this year is the last

62
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:48,738
we'll see of a worthless festival like this.

63
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:49,738
What?

64
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:52,271
That's something only you alone have decided, isn't it?

65
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,538
Now that's not pleasant to the ears.

66
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:58,838
"Kazuyuki Ogi (34)" -It was decided at the village assembly.

67
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:00,638
After all...

68
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:03,138
Just because we continued this festival,

69
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:05,638
God knows how much burden it put on the finances of this village

70
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,938
and threw us into the red?

71
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,938
In order for this village to make it through,

72
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:14,293
there's no other choice than bring the Tohto Resort Hotel here.

73
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,938
And, thanks to the Ice Hotels that you built,

74
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:20,038
everything went well.

75
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,038
Yes.

76
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,138
The people of Tohto Resort really loved it.

77
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:27,638
Well, really go for it this time,

78
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:31,438
so as to decorate the end of all this.

79
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:35,238
Tomorrow, I'll be signing a contract with Tohto Resort.

80
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:38,317
So now, the financial rut of this village will be saved.

81
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,738
It's something that the previous village head, Mr. Itakura

82
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,138
never could've done.

83
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:42,338
To be honest,

84
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:45,438
it was good that he crossed over.

85
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,738
What a thing to say!

86
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,327
You're the one who killed him!

87
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:49,838
How dare you say that!

88
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,738
Not that again.

89
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:54,738
The police even said that it was an accident, didn't they?

90
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:58,338
But, father left saying that he was going to see you.

91
00:05:58,338 --> 00:05:59,738
He couldn't have possibly gotten into an accident

92
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,038
in a remote rural place like that.

93
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,738
Who I didn't see, I didn't see!

94
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:10,838
The main gate?

95
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,355
Cancel! Cancel the festival!

96
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,357
With the main gate the way it is,

97
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,938
we couldn't possibly continue.

98
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:22,138
I'll bet you did this?

99
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,038
In order to cancel the festival.

100
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:26,365
Enough! I don't have to do something like this,

101
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,367
because it's not going to be after this year anyway.

102
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,738
Hurry up and clean it up!

103
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:31,838
The festival is cancelled!

104
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:34,373
No, it won't be cancelled.

105
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,238
I'll fix it up by morning!

106
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:39,338
You don't have anything against that, do you?

107
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:44,383
Mika, you'll help me, won't you?

108
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,385
Yes!

109
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:53,838
Mr. Agasa, we'll take things from here,

110
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,538
so please go ahead and rest.

111
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,038
No, but...

112
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,397
Yes, please do so.

113
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:02,401
Besides, I'd like children to stay over at the Ice Hotel too.

114
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,538
-Ice Hotel? -Ice Hotel?

115
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:06,938
It's the hotel, right?

116
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:08,407
That's right.

117
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,538
The Ice Hotel is something that Mr. Shiota proposed

118
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,538
to heighten excitement for the festival.

119
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:16,838
But, that actually worked against me.

120
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:18,738
What do you mean?

121
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,038
It's true that the village is in grave financial trouble.

122
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,938
Therefore, the village head is planning

123
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,425
to call the Tohto Resort Hotel people over.

124
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,338
But, since there's nothing really attractive about this village,

125
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:32,238
they didn't really give a good answer.

126
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:37,538
However, the Ice Hotel that we made caught the village head's eyes.

127
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,838
So he used it to continue negotiations of them coming over

128
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:42,238
and captured their interest.

129
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:45,138
The Ice Hotel that I made for the festival,

130
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:49,538
ironically helped in driving the festival to end.

131
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,738
I shouldn't have made something like that.

132
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,138
Please don't say that.

133
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:58,038
That Ice Hotel is our pride and joy.

134
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,738
See, please take a look at it to all or you.

135
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,838
It's fantastic.

136
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:08,838
It's splendid.

137
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,338
Is that all made of ice?

138
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:12,471
That's right!

139
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,038
Won't we freeze sleeping in a place like this?

140
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,238
There's animal fur on the bed

141
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:20,479
and if you sleep in the sleeping bag, you'll be fine.

142
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:25,838
Can't you even estimate something of this level?

143
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,738
When on earth are you going to become a full-fledged worker,

144
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:32,138
you good-for-nothing!

145
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:33,638
I... I'm sorry.

146
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,038
Go and fix it by morning.

147
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,499
Darn old fart.

148
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,138
Who the heck does he think he is?

149
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,938
Is the village head going to stay over here too?

150
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:55,138
Yeah, before the contract with Tohto Resort

151
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:59,138
he says he's going to confirm how it feels to sleep here.

152
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,521
So, the dome that you're sleeping in is this way.

153
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,138
This is fantastic!

154
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,538
It's super fluffy!

155
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,238
This sort of looks like a coffin.

156
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,638
What good taste, no?

157
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,238
Then, rest well, okay?

158
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:25,638
Yes!

159
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:45,238
It's cold.

160
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,038
I wonder if the gate's fixed already?

161
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:11,738
I'm sure it'll be okay, because everybody was helping.

162
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:15,338
I'm sure a fantastic one is being made.

163
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:18,597
-I'm excited. -What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

164
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:22,601
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko? Are you hungry?

165
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,603
-The thing is... -Village head!

166
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,938
Please get a hold of yourself! Village head!

167
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,338
What's the matter?

168
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:34,613
The village head...

169
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,619
This is...

170
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:42,938
It's burnt?

171
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,627
A strangulation mark.

172
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,629
But, this bed...

173
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:51,938
Something about it is...

174
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,633
Conan?

175
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:56,638
Call the police!

176
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:58,638
The village head's dead.

177
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,660
The cause of death is strangulation.

178
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,760
The estimated time of death...

179
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,560
"Inspector Haraguchi (31)" -is around 2:00 am?

180
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,655
Judging from the fact

181
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
that there are no traces of strangulation on the back of his neck,

182
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,659
it is thought that the culprit attacked the victim while asleep

183
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,660
using a narrow string as a weapon

184
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,460
and pushed it against his neck from on top the sleeping bag.

185
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,360
It bothers me that the neck part of the sleeping bag

186
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,660
has a string-like burn mark on it.

187
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,260
Are you saying that I killed him?

188
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,360
It's a fact that I suspected the village head

189
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,675
to be responsible for my father's death but,

190
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,660
that doesn't mean that I'd...

191
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,360
But...

192
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,160
it seems that you had a pretty violent argument with him

193
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,683
about the festival too, didn't you?

194
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,260
That's...

195
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,760
What happened to your hand?

196
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,260
I burned myself last night when I was working

197
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,760
and mistakenly touched the barrel with fire.

198
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,960
You burned yourself.

199
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,560
To tell you the truth,

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,260
there was a burn mark on the village head's sleeping bag.

201
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,860
Just what're you trying to get at?

202
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,707
She was working with us all last night fixing the gate.

203
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:13,360
She would've had no time to kill the village head.

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,060
All night through?

205
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,160
I left to go get some tools twice,

206
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,360
but there are many other witnesses.

207
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I see.

208
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,760
By the way, Mr. Shiota,

209
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,727
what time did you leave the workshop?

210
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,729
About 12 midnight and 4:00 a.m.

211
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,731
I left only for about 10 minutes both times.

212
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,733
Officer.

213
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,060
It seems that the entrance was locked,

214
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,739
but how did the culprit get inside?

215
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,741
I'm sure there's a spare key.

216
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,560
Mr. Ogi, the village head's secretary has one.

217
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,160
It's a specially made key,

218
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,760
so only two could be mad, including the master key.

219
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,751
Why do you have the spare key?

220
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,755
I was in charge of waking him up in the morning.

221
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
That's why...

222
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,360
In other words, after the village head locked the entrance,

223
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
the only one who could go in and out of the dome was you?

224
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,765
Hey...

225
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,360
Where you last night at around 2:00 am?

226
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,760
I was at the village office making documents.

227
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,560
Is there anyone who can verify that for you?

228
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,160
I was alone.

229
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,260
But, I didn't do it.

230
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,460
It's true.

231
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,260
Mr. Ogi was the only one who had the spare key.

232
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,785
Nor, does he have an alibi.

233
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,460
But, I wonder if he'd commit the crime

234
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,560
knowing that he'd be the most suspected?

235
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,460
What's that hole?

236
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,160
Come to think of it, that bed...

237
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,797
there's something strange about it.

238
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Did you find something?

239
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
Yeah, there's a strange hole here...

240
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,960
Trying to get all the credit again!

241
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
We've got to cooperate in the investigation too...

242
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,560
Hey, are you all right?

243
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,660
Really, it's dangerous to run.

244
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,815
But, I wonder why ice is so slippery?

245
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,860
It's not the ice that's slippery, it's the water!

246
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,160
Water?

247
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,821
Because ice has the characteristic of melting

248
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,823
when pressure is applied to it.

249
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,827
See! The weight of your body is on your feet, right?

250
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,460
So, that's why ice melts?

251
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,831
Exactly.

252
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,860
And because of that water, friction weakens,

253
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
making it slippery.

254
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,760
But, there's no water anywhere.

255
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,460
That's because when the pressure disappears,

256
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,660
it naturally goes back to ice...

257
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,860
Wait a second.

258
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,560
Maybe this hole...

259
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,460
Mitsuhiko, what is it?

260
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,260
You don't look too well.

261
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,360
To tell the truth, I saw it...

262
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,260
What did you see?

263
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,460
The village head's ghost.

264
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,863
It was around 4:00 this morning.

265
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,660
On my way back from the restroom.

266
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,867
It's cold.

267
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,860
A willo-the-wisp was flying around the village head's dome!

268
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,660
-No joke! -No!

269
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,960
So that's it.

270
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,460
That's the story.

271
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,260
That's why I'm telling you, it's not me!

272
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,260
-Please believe me! -Well, you can tell us the details at the station.

273
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,660
Hold it there.

274
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,160
I've finally figured it out, the truth of the case.

275
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,960
Truth or no truth,

276
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,901
the only one who was able to go in the dome was Mr. Ogi.

277
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,160
He didn't have to go in!

278
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,360
The weapon choked the village head's neck on its own.

279
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,260
Hey!

280
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,460
Conan!

281
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,260
We found it.

282
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,960
What are you planning to start with something like that?

283
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,921
Oh, well...

284
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,260
You're going to explain the trick, right?

285
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,260
That's right, I'm explaining the trick.

286
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,931
That pillar of ice in the dome

287
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,360
where the village head was found dead.

288
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,360
The PET bottle and string are the weapons that killed him.

289
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,941
Watch closely, okay?

290
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,360
The string.

291
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
The string's going inside?

292
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,959
When pressure is applied to ice, it melts.

293
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,460
It's true that the string is going in on its own.

294
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,760
But, I wonder if things would work out all that well?

295
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,967
Won't there be traces of the ice having melted?

296
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,060
There's no need to worry about that.

297
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,760
Watch closely the part that has melted.

298
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,960
True.

299
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
It's frozen again!

300
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
This is?

301
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
I see, regelation.

302
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,360
Oh, well...

303
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,660
Melted ice immediately freezes back to its normal state

304
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,989
when pressure is removed.

305
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,360
The culprit, waited until the village head fell asleep

306
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,160
and set that trick up outside the dome.

307
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,460
This way, he could kill the village head

308
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,160
no matter where he was.

309
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,005
If so, the most suspicious person would be...

310
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,360
Please wait.

311
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,009
She didn't have time to get rid of the weapon.

312
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,460
Did she need time to do that?

313
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,160
Just what are you talking about?

314
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Mika is a woman.

315
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,019
In order for her to carry away a weight as heavy as to kill a person,

316
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,160
she would need a lot of time.

317
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,023
What if she didn't carry anything?

318
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,360
Hey, Conan! Is... is this okay?

319
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Yeah.

320
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,033
That's the weight that the culprit used!

321
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,560
This is... Glass!

322
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,460
On first glance, you wouldn't be able to tell whether it's ice or not.

323
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,760
And, you can leave it behind at the site.

324
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,860
All that needs to be done later is to pull the string out of the dome...

325
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,360
It won't come off!

326
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Of course it won't, because it's frozen.

327
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,059
Then, this trick won't do.

328
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,560
That's why the culprit used this.

329
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,160
I see. All he needed to do was burn the string.

330
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,260
That's why the village head's sleeping bag was burnt.

331
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,860
But, will a string that is in ice burn so easily?

332
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,077
It will!

333
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Sonny, will this do?

334
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,160
Yes, thank you.

335
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,085
This magnesium ribbon was used, right?

336
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh, I see.

337
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,560
If so, even if it's inside ice it'll burn violently.

338
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,860
So, this is the identity of the willow-the-wisp I saw.

339
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,160
So, this was why the sleeping bag was burnt.

340
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,260
This is

341
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,560
It's a chemical compound that is created

342
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,060
when magnesium is burned, magnesium oxide.

343
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,860
If you check, there should be the same thing

344
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
inside the dome too.

345
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,360
-Get the forensics! -Yes, sir!

346
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,660
If so, it wouldn't take five minutes to put everything away, would it?

347
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,123
But, I didn't...

348
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:09,127
Right. You're not the culprit, Mika.

349
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,360
But...

350
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,860
In order to carry out this trick successfully,

351
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,060
you'd have to determine the position the village head would sleep in,

352
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,160
because you can't tell in what position the bed is, from outside.

353
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,560
True. But, then...

354
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,060
The only person that has means to know this is...

355
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,660
the person who design this Ice Hotel, you, Mr. Shiota!

356
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,460
No.

357
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,155
Please wait.

358
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,460
Although I'm the one who designed this hotel,

359
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,860
I had no way of knowing where the village head would be sleeping.

360
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,660
The size of the bed in the VIP room

361
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,163
was the exact fit for the village head.

362
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,165
I thought it was strange,

363
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,660
that the dome being as large as it was,

364
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,960
the bed was a bit too small.

365
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,360
That bed was made to fit the small framed body of the village head.

366
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,460
Proof, do you have proof?

367
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,260
The proof is the white powder

368
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
that is on Mr. Shiota's sleeve.

369
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,185
That got on when he burned the weapon.

370
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,760
That's probably magnesium oxide.

371
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,460
Mr. Shiota, please say something.

372
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,860
It's okay already, Mika.

373
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I thought that it'd work out okay.

374
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,060
Mr. Shiota.

375
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,760
Mr. Shiota why did you kill the village head?

376
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,760
I heard the conversation of the two.

377
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
It was the other day,

378
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,960
when I went to the village office to do something...

379
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,460
Get the contract, no matter what it takes.

380
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,560
Yes, sir!

381
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,560
I can't go on covering up using village money anymore.

382
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,223
There's no guarantee that somebody like Itakura,

383
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,860
who found out would appear again.

384
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,360
Rest assured.

385
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,560
If something like that should happen,

386
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,229
I'll rig the car again.

387
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,960
Oh no!

388
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,660
Yamaguchi had been using up the expenses

389
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,060
for the festival from before.

390
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,260
And, they had the nerve to do what they did to Mr. Itakura

391
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,239
who found out about it.

392
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,560
No, that's...

393
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,360
It's best that you be honest about it.

394
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,760
It can easily be checked.

395
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,249
Father...

396
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,160
Father's life was taken by scums like them.

397
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,960
Moreover, Mr. Shiota ended up using his Ice Hotel

398
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,660
as a tool to commit murder.

399
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,263
He did it to get a hold of an iron wall alibi for you, Mika.

400
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,660
-For me? -Right.

401
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,760
If the village head is killed,

402
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,560
the one that would be suspected most is you, Mika.

403
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,960
He made you an alibi

404
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,060
so that you wouldn't wrongfully be suspected.

405
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,460
Mr. Shiota.

406
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,860
Mr. Shiota's probably also the one who schemed it

407
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,560
so that the gate would collapse.

408
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,060
I wanted to protect you.

409
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,960
The one that Mr. Itakura loved the most...

410
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Mika, you.

411
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,960
So, that festival ended up being cancelled after all.

412
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,560
It can't be helped,

413
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,160
because of what happened...

414
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,391
But, I'll do everything in my power to make it happen again.

415
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,393
For the sake of this village.

416
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,399
When that time comes, let us make ice sculptures too.

417
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,760
Hey, can you make any?

418
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,560
I've already made one!

419
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,860
What 's this?

420
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,460
Something Genta likes the most, right?

421
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,060
-Yes! -Don't tell me...

422
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah! It's eels over rice!

423
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,260
Are there eels inside?

424
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,680
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,423
"Braces".

426
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,762
What's with this ice eels over rice?

427
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,820
Of course, it's an important souvenir.
