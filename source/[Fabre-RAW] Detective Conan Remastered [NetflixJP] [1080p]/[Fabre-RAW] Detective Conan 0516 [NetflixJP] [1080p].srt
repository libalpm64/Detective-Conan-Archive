1
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,490
"Torada Residence"

2
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,490
He's been hit all over his body

3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,690
and died of massive bleeding.

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,090
He fell to his death?

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,490
Yes.

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,090
My son Yoshiro, the sole heir to my estate

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,290
was killed by the hands of a ruthless devil

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,290
who holds a grudge against we, the Torada family.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,290
You mean, somebody pushed him off a high place?

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,390
No, it was a tornado.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,590
What?

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,490
He got caught in a tornado,

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,390
was sucked up into mid-air

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,690
and thrown down to his death on a rocky area.

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,790
Tornado...

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,890
which means, he wasn't murdered?

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,190
Look closely, Mr. Mouri.

18
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,690
Don't you see something in that pool of blood?

19
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,090
I'm sure you can see it if you look very closely.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,290
You'll see something that shouldn't be there.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,990
Centipede!

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,190
The corpse of that centipede appears to have stepped on once,

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,790
and placed there before the blood dried.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,890
In other words, that someone...

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,590
despite seeing our son in that condition,

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,190
didn't call for help,

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,290
but instead put that repulsive insect next to him

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,690
and left him to die.

29
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,790
But, it could be that

30
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,790
the corpse of a centipede that someone stepped on,

31
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,590
coincidentally flew there hurled by wind of the tornado...

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,290
Shigetsugu who found the dead body said that,

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,290
"there are no centipedes in area."

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,790
He also went on to say that his older brother was left to die.

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,790
Older brother?

36
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,790
Didn't you say earlier that the deceased was your sole heir?

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,990
I don't consider a moron who wastes his time hunting

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,690
for non-existent treasure, my son anymore!

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,290
And? You have an idea of who the culprit is, don't you?

40
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,290
I mean you mentioned being hated too!

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,890
Conan!

42
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,790
Yes. The ones who have been feuding with us

43
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,090
the Torada family for years.

44
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,390
The Tatsuo family.

45
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,790
I'm sure that the fiend who left our son to die

46
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,190
is among them.

47
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,490
The start of the age of mystery.

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,990
Shingen's treasures. The mystery of "Fuurinkazan".

49
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,990
The screams of Ran and Kazuha rip through the air.

50
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,290
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,890
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

53
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,070
"Fuurinkazan: The Mysterious Armored Warrior"

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,270
"Tatsuo Residence" -Your son Koji
"Fuurinkazan: The Mysterious Armored Warrior"

55
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,770
"Tatsuo Residence" -Your son Koji

56
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,670
was tied up, buried,

57
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,270
struck repeatedly with a blunt object and beaten to death.

58
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,070
On top of that, before his blood even dried up

59
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,570
the culprit left the corpse of a centipede next to him and fled.

60
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,570
Talk about cruel.

61
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,970
And? What did the police say?

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,770
Well, they just keep repeating the same answer, saying:

63
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,170
"We're investigating, we're investigating."

64
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,270
That's why I called you, Hattori.

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,270
I got my old friend

66
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,970
Ohtaki from the Osaka police department to contact you.

67
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,270
But, Mr. Ohtaki said that

68
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,670
you already have an idea of who the culprit is.

69
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,770
Well, it's more like...

70
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,370
It's revenge.

71
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,870
Thinking that we, the Tatsuo family

72
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,370
was to blame for the death of their son,

73
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,770
someone in the Torada family

74
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,670
killed Koji in retaliation.

75
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,870
Mother! We don't know for sure yet.

76
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,270
No doubt, seeing from how hideous and ruthless the murder was,

77
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,870
that it was one of them that did it!

78
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,170
And? Who found the corpse?

79
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,870
Oh, my other son, Akira.

80
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,470
He said he found it on his way back home

81
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,270
from horseback archery practice.

82
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,670
Horseback archery is the sport

83
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,370
where you fire an arrow while riding a horse, isn't it?

84
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,970
Yeah. Akira is a top practitioner of it in our village,

85
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,270
and always displays his skills during festivals.

86
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,670
And where is Akira now?

87
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,570
Got them all. Just as expected of you, Akira!

88
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,770
Yeah, I guess I'll get to be the horseback archery bowman

89
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,770
for the next festival too.

90
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,870
If so, you'll have been one for six consecutive years.

91
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,870
They should just declare you be the horseback archery bowman already!

92
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,570
No, I haven't reached my senior's level yet.

93
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,870
Are you Akira?

94
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,070
Oh, yes.

95
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,970
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri from Tokyo.

96
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,370
If it's okay with you,

97
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,270
I'd like to ask you about the situation

98
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,470
when you found Koji's body.

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,570
I guess. I don't mind.

100
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,970
Do you have any reason to find it difficult to answer?

101
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,070
Oh, no, it's just that someone asked me

102
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,270
the exact same question a while ago.

103
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,570
A boy detective with an Osaka accent.

104
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,770
Osaka accent?

105
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,670
A boy detective?

106
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,870
Don't tell me that...

107
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,770
Yeah, I'm the one who found my older brother Yoshiro's body.

108
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,570
It's true that there was the corpse of a centipede next to the body.

109
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,670
But, why a centipede?

110
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,970
Beats me...

111
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,170
Does either the Torada family or the Tatsuo family

112
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,270
have any karmic connection or something with centipedes?

113
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,270
I don't know of any karmic connection.

114
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,970
But, I have a feeling I've seen pictures of centipedes at the festival.

115
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,270
Festival?

116
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,670
At the festival where the horseback archery is held,

117
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,170
the men of the village have a mock battle.

118
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,170
They wear the armor over there.

119
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,070
Although it's called an armor,

120
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,670
it's just a fairly lightweight plastic protector

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,270
provided by the village.

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,370
I have a feeling

123
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,670
I saw a picture of the centipede somewhere at the festival.

124
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,970
Where? Did you see a drawing of it on a chest protector or something?

125
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,070
I know that one of the warlords of the Sengoku Period

126
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,970
had a drawing of a dragonfly on his helmet.

127
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,670
Speaking of warlords,

128
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,870
there was a detective who came by and asked the same question.

129
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,870
A detective?

130
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,670
Yeah. A detective from Tokyo.

131
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,770
His last name was the same as one of the warlords.

132
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,570
Could it have been Mouri?

133
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,170
Right! Like in Motonari Mouri!

134
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,370
It's Ran's dad!

135
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,570
Was there a little kid wearing glasses with them too?

136
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,970
Yeah.

137
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,970
He was asking about the incident more diligently than the detective.

138
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,370
It's Kudo!

139
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,170
That reminds me. Akira told us that

140
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,370
a person died in a strange accident that happened six years ago.

141
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,970
Is that true?

142
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,370
Yeah. The deceased was the one selected to be our

143
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,870
horseback riding archery bowman for the festival, until the previous year,

144
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,070
Mr. Kuroto Kai.

145
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,670
I heard he fell off a cliff while practicing...

146
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,270
Who would know more about this in detail?

147
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,070
Maybe Yui, my late brother's wife.

148
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,770
After all, she's the one who found his body.

149
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,570
Where is she now?

150
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,370
You see those stables behind the fence?

151
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,370
I'm sure she's taking care of the horses now.

152
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,870
It's Kudo!

153
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,070
Kudo was also lured over and came here, smelling out the case!

154
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,570
It's just as I thought! We're two of a kind, birds of a feather!

155
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,770
Hey, come on, give me a break!

156
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,070
I'm still trying to get over the death of my husband, you know!

157
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,670
-I'm in no mood... -Oh, listen to him going at it!

158
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,570
Please leave already!

159
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,570
Hey! Why don't you cut it out already?

160
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,070
What is it, kid?

161
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,070
Well...

162
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,570
Have you seen a detective

163
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,470
with swept back hair, a flimsy mustache and a dopey look?

164
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,570
Swept back hair, a flimsy mustache and a dopey look.

165
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,670
You mean like this?

166
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,670
No, not at all...

167
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,170
Kazuha, Hattori, long time no see!

168
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,570
Ran! How've you been?

169
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,170
Great!

170
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,670
So it's him after all.

171
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,870
And, who's that grouchy looking man?

172
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,670
Beats me.

173
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

174
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,970
the one in charge of this case!

175
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,070
A police detective?

176
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,370
I was just asking her some questions.

177
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,370
Okay, ma'am. I'll ask you once more.

178
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,770
Was it there six years ago or was it not?

179
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,270
I just said, I'm in no mood to answer.

180
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,870
People's lives are at stake!

181
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,470
Stop blabbering and answer me!

182
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,170
There wasn't.

183
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,670
There was no centipede near the corpse.

184
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,970
The only thing there was a thin corpse on the ground

185
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,470
along with a dead horse.

186
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,870
I see.

187
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,570
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

188
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,270
Hey, hold it.

189
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,770
What's with the centipede?

190
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,170
I don't know for sure yet but...

191
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,470
if we don't figure this case out right away,

192
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,070
we're going to be seeing a lot of corpses rolling on the ground

193
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,870
just like on the battlefields of the Warring Period.

194
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,770
As to what these two successive cases

195
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,470
share in common,

196
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,570
the people who found the dead bodies

197
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,470
were both related to the victims.

198
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,670
And, for some unknown reason,

199
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,270
a dead centipede was found nearby.

200
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,370
The thing that bothers me is the incident six years ago,

201
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,370
when Mr. Kuroto Kai during horseback archery practice

202
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,570
fell over a cliff along with his horse and passed away.

203
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,770
But, I'd say, it was just an accident

204
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,770
and most likely has nothing to do with these two cases.

205
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,470
Yeah. That is, if we believe what Ms. Yui Torada said

206
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,570
about no centipedes being found near the bodies.

207
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,370
There wasn't any.

208
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,070
Although no centipedes were placed by the bodies,

209
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,770
the fact that the victims were left to die,

210
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,170
resembles the first case, in which my husband died.

211
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,670
He was left to die?

212
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,070
Didn't he die instantly after falling over the cliff?

213
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,470
I told you, didn't I?

214
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,170
That the corpse was emaciated.

215
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,670
It's true that when he fell off the cliff,

216
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,370
he sustained serious injuries when his body slammed against

217
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,170
the trees and the rocks.

218
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,470
His outfit was also smeared all over with blood,

219
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,370
and oxidation caused it to turn totally black.

220
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,870
-But, he died of starvation. -Starvation?

221
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,470
Yes.

222
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,470
In addition to not being able to stand because he broke his hip bone,

223
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,570
he fell in a place where sunlight didn't shine at all.

224
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,470
Besides, he fell right below the cliff where people rarely pass by.

225
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,370
He was found almost a week after his fall.

226
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,170
A week later?

227
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,270
No one found him despite the horse falling over with him too?

228
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,770
Did you really search for him?

229
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,070
Of course! The police as well as all the villagers

230
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,470
searched for him staying up till late!

231
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,870
After all, Officer Kai was loved by all the villagers!

232
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,170
Officer?

233
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,670
You mean he was a police officer?

234
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,170
Yes. He worked at the village police box.

235
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,570
He had a strong sense of justice, was kind and gentle.

236
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,570
I never heard of anyone in the village speak ill of him.

237
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,270
That's why we all searched frantically for him when he disappeared.

238
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,270
Then why couldn't he be found for an entire week?

239
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,570
-The leaves. -Leaves?

240
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,270
He was unfortunately buried under the fallen leaves,

241
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,070
and hidden beneath until the wind blew them away.

242
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,670
My brother Yoshiro's body was easily found

243
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,170
because it had fallen on a rocky area in clear view.

244
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,270
Did all the villagers look for him back then too?

245
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,570
No, we started looking for him only after we found out

246
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,070
he didn't come back despite daybreak.

247
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,270
Started looking for him?

248
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,870
Didn't you find my husband coincidentally

249
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,570
when you were headed for that hole?

250
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,470
Oh, maybe you're right.

251
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,070
"That hole?"

252
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,070
It's just a hobby.

253
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,570
I sort of treasure hunter, you see.

254
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,570
Hobby my foot!

255
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,070
As if not working isn't enough,

256
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,370
getting carried away with something like that.

257
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,670
You're a shame to the Torada family!

258
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,370
Shape up, Shigetsugu.

259
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,970
After all, you're the only heir left as of now.

260
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,870
Yeah.

261
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,170
And? Did you come up with anything, Mr. Mouri?

262
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,470
No, only that the corpse of a centipede was found near

263
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,470
the deceased body of Koji Tatsuo and Yoshiro as well.

264
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,270
Come to think of it,

265
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,570
Koji used to have a lot of private talks with my husband before he died.

266
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,870
Private talks?

267
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,470
Something about "going" or "not going."

268
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,170
Yeah. I heard him say that too.

269
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,970
He said that they would be going together see

270
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,670
that one-eyed detective called Yamato soon.

271
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,570
And that it may turn into something terrible,

272
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,670
so to be prepared for it.

273
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,670
What?

274
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,270
Did you hear what they were going to meet him for?

275
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,470
No. Only that he couldn't talk about it yet.

276
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,970
Maybe we'll be able to find something

277
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,770
if we go over to the Tatsuo residence then.

278
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,870
Yeah, let's strike while the iron's hot!

279
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,270
Okay, we're heading over there,

280
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,570
so you stay here at the house with her, Kazuha!

281
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,370
-What? -Take us with you too!

282
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,570
Don't be silly, you'll only get in our way!

283
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,570
They were planning to go to the police?

284
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,870
You mean my son Koji and Yoshiro Torada?

285
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,870
Yes, haven't you heard anything about it from your son?

286
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,770
No, nothing at all.

287
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,570
Only after Yoshiro passed away,

288
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,570
he seemed to be terrified of something.

289
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,970
He seemed terrified?

290
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,770
Right, he used to mumble even during meals,

291
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,570
saying, it could be his turn next. That he'd be killed.

292
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,070
Cursed to death.

293
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,970
-Cursed? -Don't you understand?

294
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,970
The curse of the Torada family

295
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,170
that has been hating the Tatuso family for generations!

296
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,770
How come this family and that family don't get along?

297
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,470
That's because...

298
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,970
long, long ago...

299
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,770
It seems to have slipped my mind.

300
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,970
-Come on... -Granny.

301
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,470
I was told that the Torada family was hateful

302
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,170
since I was a little child.

303
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,470
But, I've forgotten why.

304
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,670
I'm sure the feeling is mutual with the Torada family too.

305
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,970
Now that the knotted chains have loosened up,

306
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,370
both Ayaka and I

307
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,270
were on good terms

308
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,070
with Yoshiro and Shigetsugu Torada.

309
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,370
But then those two had been talking about

310
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,970
going to the police before they died.

311
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,470
I bet it had to do with the accident

312
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,770
involving the police officer called Kai.

313
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,070
That was just an accident.

314
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,270
He worked too hard on horseback archery practice,

315
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,070
he fell off the cliff from exhaustion.

316
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,770
He was too uptight over

317
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,670
missing the target at the tournament that year.

318
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,870
Now, stop that! Ayaka!

319
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,770
But that's what everybody says!

320
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,470
They even say that he might have jumped off the cliff

321
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,970
from the shock.

322
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,270
There are times when the archer misses the mark?

323
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,070
Yes, once in while.

324
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,070
But Mr. Kai never missed.

325
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,270
Until that last shot of the tournament that year.

326
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,870
He would never think of committing suicide.

327
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,370
He would leave the people of the village

328
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,970
just because of some embarrassment at a tournament.

329
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,470
He isn't such a coward.

330
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,670
Huh? You're staying over there?

331
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,770
You're not planning to come back here, Heiji?

332
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,970
Well, it's starting to rain hard.

333
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,870
And, they way it's really dangerous walking in the woods at night.

334
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,370
So, it's how it is.

335
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,470
Sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite!

336
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,270
Hey! Heiji!

337
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,870
He hang up.

338
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,870
So, Kudo! Anything you noticed?

339
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,470
Nothing yet.

340
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,470
The one thing that bugs me

341
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,070
is what Koji had been muttering before he died.

342
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,770
That he might be next.

343
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,670
If that's true, this is a serial murder case!

344
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,270
On top of that, there may be more to come!

345
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,970
Hey, Ran. Ran!

346
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,270
Did you hear that?

347
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,070
Huh?

348
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,170
I only hear the rain and the thunder.

349
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,370
Hey, that one! I hear something else.

350
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,570
Like the floor creaking.

351
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,200
It's true! It's for real!

352
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,300
We really did see it, didn't we, Ran?

353
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,900
Yeah! We weren't imagining it!

354
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,500
Well, but...

355
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,600
What are you doing here, Kazuha?

356
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,300
Heiji. I saw something.

357
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Seen what?

358
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,900
Last night, when a lightning flashed...

359
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,600
It was standing right behind the screen door!

360
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
The armored...

361
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Wandering warrior!

362
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,900
A wandering warrior?

363
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,800
You mean the suit of armor we saw in Shigetsugu's room

364
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,400
the one they use in the festival?

365
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,100
No! The one we saw had some fluffy hair on the helment.

366
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,000
That's the legendary Suwa Hossyo helmet of Shingen Takeda!

367
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Takeda...

368
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,800
you mean the Red Armor of Takeda?

369
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,600
Was the armor red?

370
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,900
Well... what we saw as a silhouette.

371
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,200
No!

372
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,000
Ayaka locked herself up in the toilet?

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,900
Right after you were talking about Shingen Takeda's armor?

374
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,800
-Hey, Ayaka! What happened? -Come out! Don't make such a ruckus!

375
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,600
Ayaka! Ayaka!

376
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,900
What is going on?

377
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,000
She's not here? My daughter-in-law!

378
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,800
I wonder. She was right here a while ago.

379
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
She asked me to be left alone,

380
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,100
so I left for a while.

381
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,400
She must still be nearby!

382
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
We need to split up and find her!

383
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Then I'll use my scooter.

384
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,300
I'll take the car!

385
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,600
Akira, Yui and I will take the horses!

386
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,100
The rest on foot!

387
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,500
Ayaka!

388
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,800
Where are you?

389
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,900
Ayaka!

390
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,200
Where are you?

391
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Ayaka! Ayaka!

392
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,300
Answer!

393
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,500
-Ayaka! -Ayaka!

394
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,700
Where are you?

395
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,300
When I got here...

396
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,700
There she was, like that.

397
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,900
Conan, you shouldn't be...

398
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,300
What's going on?

399
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,100
What is it?

400
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,200
Ayaka, Ayaka is...

401
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,900
Ayaka! Ayaka!

402
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,600
Don't move!

403
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,500
The area is now under police control!

404
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,700
Anyone trying to get inside will be prosecuted by me!

405
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,000
What the...

406
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,300
Hey! You on the black horse.

407
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,600
Keep off, you hear!

408
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,500
Yes.

409
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,200
What the...

410
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,300
What happened?

411
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,500
Darn! Didn't make it!

412
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,900
Uehara, confirm the time!

413
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,300
Yes, sir.

414
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,200
8:59 am.

415
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,800
Sorry, old habit.

416
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
No problem.

417
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Old?

418
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,900
Habit?

419
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,100
It's me!

420
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,400
A death in the forest near the Toradas.

421
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,200
Send the forensic people right away!

422
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,500
Yeah, right! This is serial murder!

423
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Serial murder?

424
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,700
No doubt!

425
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
The first death of Yoshiro Torada,

426
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,000
left to die after being maimed in a tornado.

427
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,400
The second case of Koji Tatsuo beaten to death

428
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,200
and buried in a mound.

429
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,800
Just like in the two earlier cases,

430
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,200
there it was, at the foot of Ayaka Tatsuo's body,

431
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
a dead centipede!

432
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What?

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,400
On top of that,

434
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,200
the ground around the centipede was wet with rain

435
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,400
and shows no trace except my own footprints and cane prints!

436
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,900
After the rain,

437
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,900
no one seems to have been up this tree

438
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,000
which means...

439
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,100
It's impossible...

440
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,600
Impossible murder.

441
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,920
Impossible murder?

442
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Well, there is the possibility of your footprints being there

443
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,720
are already before the body had been lowered.

444
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,620
Is that right, early-bird police detective?

445
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,820
When I arrived at the Torada residence,

446
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,420
I was told that everybody went searching for Ayaka Tatsuo.

447
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,720
That's why I came.

448
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,320
Still, the timing seems to be too perfect, maybe.

449
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,820
It could be that Ayaka had been asked on her cell phone

450
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,420
to come out of the toilet

451
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,220
was put to sleep, staging it to look like suicide

452
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,120
and returning to the Torada residence, pretending to know nothing.

453
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,320
I don't think that's possible.

454
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,720
I saw the police detective put her down on the ground

455
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,020
and I didn't see any footprints or traces of his cane.

456
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,220
By the way, I heard she was acting strange

457
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,820
right before she locked herself up in the toilet.

458
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,520
What happened?

459
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,620
Last night, we saw from our room

460
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,220
the silhouette of an armored warrior on our screen door.

461
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,920
When we said the helmet

462
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,520
looked like a Suwa Hossyou from the shape of it,

463
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,120
Ayaka started to tremble.

464
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
It is a curse.

465
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,220
They brought on the curse of Lord Shingen

466
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,520
and were driven to their deaths.

467
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,720
And the dead centipede is the proof of it!

468
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,620
Why Shingen Takeda and the centipede?

469
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,120
Don't you know?

470
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,020
Lord Shingen called his messengers in the battlefield

471
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,220
the "Centipedes".

472
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,720
And made them bear centipede banners.

473
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,220
So, that's why!

474
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,520
I thought I was centipede drawings somewhere.

475
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,720
I saw someone carrying the banner

476
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,020
in the mock battle staged in the festival.

477
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,320
And you were searching for the treasure, not knowing such things?

478
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,520
Then the treasure you're looking for...

479
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,720
Shingen Takeda's?

480
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Yes, the hidden treasure of Shingen!

481
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,720
Ever since scrolls and maps suggesting its existence

482
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,220
were found in our warehouse,

483
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,420
Shigetsugu became absorbed in it.

484
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,720
The two who died before, as well as Ayaka

485
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,820
and Akira Tatsuo over there, got involved in it.

486
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,720
It wasn't greed!

487
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,120
We thought that if really found,

488
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,720
it will be a great way to revive the community.

489
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,520
And, why must Ayaka be cursed?

490
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,620
She just paid visits to the excavation site to bring food and supplies?

491
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,820
It's not a curse at all.

492
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,320
This is a genuine case of serial murders!

493
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,020
Like that mustached guy says.

494
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,920
I couldn't find Ayaka's cell phone in her belt bag.

495
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,920
She had been lured out of where she locked herself up.

496
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,620
By the serial murderer.

497
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Well, if you don't have to end up dead,

498
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,020
make sure you don't walk around alone.

499
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,220
Especially those who had been treasure hunters.

500
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,320
Really? So, the warrior was standing right here?

501
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,920
Yeah, though it disappeared right away.

502
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,620
Why didn't you open the door and use your karate to catch it?

503
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,020
But I was petrified because I thought I saw a ghost!

504
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,220
And karate and aikido don't work on ghosts.

505
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,420
Silly! There aren't any ghosts here.

506
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,520
See what it is.

507
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,720
Plastic rope used in packages!

508
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,320
The rope appears to be shredded into fiber.

509
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,120
I saw a few on them in the corridor and on the ground.

510
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,220
I get it!

511
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,820
If you shred it, bundle the fiber and attach it to a helment.

512
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,620
The silhouette seen through the screen door

513
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,220
will look like Shingen Takeda's Suwa Hossyo helmet!

514
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,620
Then, it's the armor found in Shigetsugu's room,

515
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
the one used in festivals?

516
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,820
No.

517
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
Look at that!

518
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,520
There are strange straw sandal footprints!

519
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,920
They're leading all the way out of the back gate!

520
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,220
That means, someone from outside entered,

521
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,920
took the suit of armor and created the Shingen silhouette.

522
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,620
Either that or someone in the house left the footprints there

523
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,820
to make it look like an outsider entered the house.

524
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,720
Come to think of it, Shigetsugu was saying,

525
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,120
there's another suit of armor in Akira's house.

526
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,620
There's another set in the other house?

527
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,020
Yeah.

528
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,520
The armor at the Tatsuo house is supposedly great-looking.

529
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,120
Then, we'll go check out the Tatsuos.

530
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,320
You two stay with Pops.

531
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,820
What?

532
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,520
Just to let you know, uncle.

533
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,920
Keep an eye from that treasure hunter Shigetsugu!

534
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,320
I know what to do!

535
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,020
-Okay, see ya! -Darn!

536
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,120
We're left behind again.

537
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,220
I think he doesn't want you to get hurt.

538
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Yeah, we often see horrid stuff

539
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,120
and get chased by murderers.

540
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,920
You think so?

541
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,320
Yeah! He's trying to be evasive now

542
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,620
and brag about his discovery later on!

543
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Shinichi used to do that. Really.

544
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,920
But in Shinichi's case, it has nothing to do with

545
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,420
liking you a lot or something like that.

546
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,320
"Let your rapidity be that of the wind."

547
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,020
You like him, don't you? That tanned boy.

548
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,820
No...

549
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,620
You might choose to sit tight, immovable as a mountain.

550
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,220
The other is to take swift action,

551
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,120
like the wind, when the affection is still burning in you.

552
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,920
If you leave it untouched,

553
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,720
before you let know how you feel...

554
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,120
that person might disappear from you

555
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,320
and make you regret over what you didn't do.

556
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,820
Like me.

557
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,620
It's strange, isn't it, Kudo?

558
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:11,920
Yeah, the gag that sealed Ayaka's mouth!

559
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,620
At first, I thought it was for not letting out a sound.

560
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,420
But if you're going to make it look like

561
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,020
a suicide driven by Shingen's curse,

562
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,720
you would take it off, wouldn't you?

563
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,720
So, that means there was a reason for not taking it off.

564
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,620
Or was it deliberate?

565
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,120
If it were deliberate, why would that be necessary?

566
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,620
I don't see the possibility of a corpse talking.

567
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,020
Might be a signal to someone?

568
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,120
Like, keep quiet, don't talk?

569
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,220
Well, this is quite impressive.

570
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,220
It's red, meaning Shingen's red?

571
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,120
Yes.

572
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,720
Is this family somehow related to the Takeda family?

573
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,620
No. My mother and I are just great Shingen fans.

574
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,120
We invested a small fortune into it.

575
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,820
The late Koji-kun, my son, and Torada's Yoshiro

576
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,120
were also Shingen fans.

577
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
They often came here to take a look.

578
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,020
My other son Akira wasn't all that interested, though.

579
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,020
Both Koji and Akira are your sons, right?

580
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,820
Why do you refer to Koji as "Koji-kun"

581
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,520
while you call Akira simply as Akira?

582
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,120
Actually Koji-kun was my son-in-law,

583
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
married to my daughter born after Akira.

584
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,720
He adopted our family name.

585
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,620
My daughter died long time ago in a traffic accident.

586
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,120
Long before the marriage,

587
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,720
Koji-kun had been classmates with Akira at school

588
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,020
and frequented our house as a kid.

589
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,520
I've been calling him "Koji-kun" since then and couldn't kick the habit.

590
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Talking of classmates,

591
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,420
Yoshiro and Shigetsugu of the Torada family

592
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,420
had been classmates, too.

593
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,520
How can brothers born in different years be classmates?

594
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,020
Well, Yoshiro

595
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,520
is the son of Naonobu Torada's elder sister,

596
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,520
who died with her husband long ago.

597
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,620
He had been adopted into the family

598
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,620
and was brought up with Shigetsugu like brothers.

599
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,220
So, that means the three who died recently

600
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,720
actually aren't related to either the Toradas or the Tatsuos?

601
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,820
Right. And, Ayaka was Akira's wife.

602
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,620
Hey, what's that banner behind the armor?

603
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Oh, that's a replica.

604
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,120
Can you read it, son?

605
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,620
Let your rapidity be that of the wind,

606
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,420
your silence that of the forest.

607
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,620
In raiding and plundering be like fire,

608
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,420
in immovability like a mountain.

609
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,120
From Art of War, the ancient teaching in military warfare from Sun Tzu.

610
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,820
I got it!

611
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,920
Left abandoned after being seriously injured

612
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,820
in the tornado, Yoshiro.

613
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,020
Wind!

614
00:33:54,020 --> 00:34:01,120
Yoshiro, tied and buried in a mound shaped like a mountain.

615
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,520
Mountain!

616
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,220
Ayaka gagged and hung from a tree in the middle of the woods.

617
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,320
Forest!

618
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Then it can't be...

619
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,220
Yes, the killings

620
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,920
are patterned after Shingen Takeda's military slogan!

621
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,920
The strategy he embraced.

622
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,720
The "Fuurinkazan"!

623
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,190
What? Fuurinkazan?

624
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,790
The killings are being executed after that pattern?

625
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,990
Right.

626
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,990
Think back carefully! Three murders in a row!

627
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,090
First, there was Yoshiro Torada, who was seriously injured

628
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,890
in a tornado and left to die.

629
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,090
Tornado means wind,

630
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,890
referring to "let your rapidity be that of the wind."

631
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:03,690
Next, the second was Koji found tied up and buried in a mound.

632
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,290
He was tied up so he can't move,

633
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,990
like a mountain.

634
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,790
"In immovability like a mountain." Mountain!

635
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,390
And the third murder of Ayaka Tatsuo, found dead in the forest.

636
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,290
If the gag was a message to be quiet and not talk...

637
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,390
I see.

638
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,490
The message was "your silence that of a forest".

639
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,490
Right.

640
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,690
This serial murderer seems to have a fixation for Shingen Takeda.

641
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,490
But, why Shingen?

642
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,190
Is it a plot to block them from finding Shingen's hidden treasure?

643
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,890
Beats me.

644
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,590
So far, what we know

645
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,890
is that we still have the character "fire" left from that phrase.

646
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,790
It means that the killer is scheming

647
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,590
to take the life of one more person!

648
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,490
Then does that mean the next target

649
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,990
is either Shigetsugu or Akira,

650
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,190
who had cooperated in the treasure hunt?

651
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,090
Yeah. That's highly likely.

652
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,890
But, there still is the off chance

653
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,790
that the next victim is someone else.

654
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,990
Anyway, we'll be on the lookout for that one.

655
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,690
I want Pops to keep an eye on the guys!

656
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,790
Especially, Shigetsugu.

657
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,990
Yeah.

658
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,390
Ran. What's "Fuurinkazan"?

659
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,090
I don't know. I think I've heard about it on TV and movies.

660
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,290
What, you don't know?

661
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,590
Let your rapidity be that of the wind,

662
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,390
your silence that of the forest.

663
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,090
In raiding and plundering be like fire,

664
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,690
in immovability like a mountain.

665
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,790
It's an approach to warfare

666
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,290
conceived by a master named Sun Tzu.

667
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,090
When you mobilize an army, you have to be swift as the wind.

668
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,390
When you stop the army's movement, as quiet as a forest.

669
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,590
When attacking, you have to be as fierce as fire!

670
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,390
If you decide to defend, be as immovable as a mountain.

671
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,190
Shingen Takeda embraced this Art of War

672
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,790
and displayed it in his war banners.

673
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,590
That was what Yui had been telling us.

674
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,590
You might choose to sit tight, immovable as a mountain.

675
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,890
The other is to take swift action,

676
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,390
like the wind, when the affection is still burning in you.

677
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,790
Right! It applies in the game of love, too.

678
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,190
Fuurinkazan is the way to go!

679
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,190
Here you are!

680
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,290
I don't think practice will do you any good

681
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,990
when you're down over

682
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,890
the loss of your wife.

683
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,990
I must, with the festival approaching.

684
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,990
Nothing can interrupt practice.

685
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,690
I pledge to my mentor Kai

686
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,190
that I will defend the title of the horseback archer the best I can.

687
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,490
And, it was also the wish of my wife Ayaka.

688
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,090
And the reason why I missed

689
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,390
wasn't because of any emotional problems.

690
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,690
Look, can you see traces of the target being moved slightly?

691
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,390
Right you are.

692
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,390
I wonder who did it.

693
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,090
Right behind the trees! I see people!

694
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,690
Who are you?

695
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,890
Wait up!

696
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,990
Probably people from the neighboring village.

697
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,790
They're trying to make me lose confidence.

698
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,490
What ever for?

699
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,990
Because the honor of the village is at stake.

700
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,090
The festival

701
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,290
has been traditionally organized by the two villages

702
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,590
and there is only one archer in horseback archery,

703
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,690
which is the highlight of the event.

704
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,790
If they are able to crush Akira,

705
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,190
who went through the preliminaries

706
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,090
and became village representative,

707
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,690
the star of the festival will be the archer of their village

708
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,990
and will be able to brag all year long.

709
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,690
Starting with Kai,

710
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,890
the title had been ours for more than 10 years.

711
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,290
About the preliminaries, how are they've done?

712
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,590
It takes place in the shrine grounds,

713
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,790
with ten targets positioned in equal distance from each other,

714
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,990
calculating the success rate.

715
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,890
Again and again, until the winner is chosen.

716
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:25,390
Yes. Six years ago, you and Kai didn't miss a mark.

717
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,890
The sun began to set,

718
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,090
so the competition was to continue the next day.

719
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,690
Then, Kai went missing.

720
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,090
And I found him dead one week later.

721
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,590
Yes.

722
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,190
If the competition had continued the next day,

723
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,190
I would've lost.

724
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,690
After the tie,

725
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,590
Kai told me that he was going on the refresher practice.

726
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:53,390
As for me, I was exhausted and wasn't able to move anymore.

727
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,390
He went to practice, when it was already dark?

728
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,790
Yeah.

729
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,890
So long as he knew the location of the targets,

730
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,790
he was able to hit them with his eyes closed.

731
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,990
But, he missed one in the last competition, didn't he?

732
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,290
I'm sure

733
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,190
it was the doing of the people from the neighboring village!

734
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,390
The target was moved intentionally to embarrass Kai!

735
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:23,990
Not knowing that, Uncle Naonobu was furious at Kai.

736
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,390
You disgraced me!

737
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,190
Why was it a disgrace?

738
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,690
I heard that Uncle taught Kai horseback archery.

739
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,890
And, it developed into an argument

740
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,190
with Grandmother Shigeyo who happened to step in.

741
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,990
How dare you act like that when you've never even once

742
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,790
been an archer of the festival?

743
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:50,290
So most everyone had ties to this person Kai.

744
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,690
Right.

745
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,590
And, every one of them is a suspect of the serial murders.

746
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,690
I investigated thoroughly into the site

747
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,990
where Ayaka Tatsuo was found dead.

748
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,390
And only found footprints of the members of the search party,

749
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,290
hoof prints,

750
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,290
and tracks of scooter and car tires.

751
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,490
In other words,

752
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,690
the people who were able to commit the crime,

753
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,990
except for you outsiders, are seven people,

754
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,690
Naonobu, Tatsue, Shigetsuku and Yui of the Torada family

755
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:26,090
and Shigeyo, Tamefumi and Akira of the Tatsuo family.

756
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,890
There are eight!

757
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,290
Your footprints. There were traces of your cane, too...

758
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,390
Isn't that right, police detective?

759
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,390
Okay!

760
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,490
Include me, if you want to!

761
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,190
Mrs. Torada, you came to pick up that black horse, right?

762
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,790
Then take it and go back home right away!

763
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:48,890
You, too. Take the brats and go back to the Tatsuos!

764
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,890
Yes.

765
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,690
When you get back, tell the people that

766
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,690
the killer is among you!

767
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,090
Tell them to pray to the gods while they wait for me to arrive

768
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,990
and get my hands on the murderer!

769
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:12,990
You no longer call me by my name, Kan.

770
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,790
Sorry, but you're no longer Yui that I knew from childhood.

771
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,390
Neither are you my subordinate Officer Uehara.

772
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,490
You're just the wife of a murder victim

773
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,890
and one of the suspects.

774
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,790
A subordinate? That means...

775
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,590
A former detective?

776
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,190
How many times do I have to tell you?

777
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,390
I see no reason why anybody would want to kill me!

778
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,090
What in the world are you doing?

779
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,490
With all these things going on,

780
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,790
I decided the treasure hunt must be interrupted.

781
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,090
So, I came to pick up my documents.

782
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,490
But, I can't find it.

783
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,690
The notes I took while searching for the treasure.

784
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,190
Don't you think Akira might have taken them?

785
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,990
You and he are the only survivors of the excavation team.

786
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,490
Maybe to keep the treasure for himself.

787
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,290
No way! Akira won't do such a thing!

788
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,890
He's the hero of our class!

789
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,590
But, people change, you know, Shigetsugu.

790
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,190
He is a Tatsuo, after all.

791
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,790
You never know what really on his mind!

792
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:23,290
Don't put him on the same level as that good-for-nothing son of yours!

793
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,590
Akira is a samurai! An archer of the festival for five straight years!

794
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,290
What are you doing here?

795
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,390
We're looking for Akira.

796
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,690
We thought he might be here.

797
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,190
I just got a call from Heiji

798
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,090
that Akira had just finished his archery practice

799
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,590
and is on his way home.

800
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:45,590
Anyway, let us all go home and wait.

801
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,190
Until the case is settled.

802
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,990
You, too, Mr. Shigetsugu!

803
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,490
All right.

804
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,990
Then, we will be going this way.

805
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,790
Be careful on your way home!

806
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,190
That ogre of a woman!

807
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,590
Who's going to attack that monster?

808
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,990
The feeling's mutual, you bald racoon dog!

809
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,190
Well...

810
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,390
Don't you two remember what Shingen said?

811
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,290
"Friendship is your ally, enmity is your foe."

812
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,490
Shouldn't you stop quarreling

813
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,790
and cooperate to solve this case,

814
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,490
for the good of both families?

815
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,090
I don't need to hear that from a dullard like you!

816
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:34,290
Those were Officer Kai's pet phrase.

817
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:39,990
He used to settle disputes between the families with those words.

818
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,490
You, Shingen-freak dolt!

819
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,190
Will you be my wife when you grow up?

820
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,390
Just kidding! Kansuke will start complaining!

821
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,790
Hey, don't call me "master".

822
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,590
I may be older than you. But you are my rival!

823
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,690
Just call me Kai!

824
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,390
Hey, Hattori.

825
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,990
Why does the killer pattern the murders after "Fuurinkazan"?

826
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,890
It might have something to do with

827
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:22,190
the three of them looking for Shingen's treasure.

828
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,790
Or trying to make it look like that,

829
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,790
trying to hide the real motive.

830
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,590
But, the tornado that swept off Yoshiro was a coincidence.

831
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,190
Still, there was the dead centipede ready to be placed near him.

832
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:42,190
So, the killer had been planning to kill the three for a long time.

833
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,790
Then, I need to find out what Yoshiro and Koji

834
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,690
wanted to talk about with that police detective Yamato.

835
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:56,990
And why Ayaka was horrified by the story of Shingen's helmet.

836
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,190
And the other thing that bugs me.

837
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,890
Yeah.

838
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,990
Officer Kai falling off the cliff.

839
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,990
Anyway, we still have the character

840
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,290
for "fire" left from "Fuurinkazan."

841
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,790
Who's next? It is Akira! Or is it...

842
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,890
What was that?

843
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,790
It sounded like thunder.

844
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,690
Heiji! Something's happened!

845
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,590
What, Kazuha? What is it?

846
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,190
There was a big noise and when I turned around,

847
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,090
Shigetsugu was gone.

848
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,090
When I came looking for him to the railway crossing,

849
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,990
the train was stopped there.

850
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,390
At the head of the train.

851
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,890
A person was lying on the ground. A person is burning!

852
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,590
A person is burning?

853
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,690
Yeah. Is that Shigetsugu?

854
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,390
Stay there! I'll be there right now!

855
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,690
Is that "In raiding and plundering be like fire"?

856
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,920
Next Conan's Hint:

857
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,980
Eyeshadow.
