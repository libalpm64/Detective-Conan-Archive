1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,280
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,280
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,180
Today's stage is an old castle.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,880
A great adventure for the Youth Detective Squad.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,380
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,980
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,790
"Tobuzankei Campsite"

9
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,490
Oh, what fantastic scenery.

10
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,190
Hey, hurry up!

11
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,090
Why do we have to camp in such cold weather?

12
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,390
Children are so energetic, that I envy them.

13
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,590
Hey, there are fish there!

14
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,190
Really? Where? Where?

15
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,690
Dr. Agasa, get the tent out, will you?

16
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,290
The tent...

17
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,390
What's up, Doc?

18
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,090
Don't tell me you did something like forget the tent?

19
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,090
Well...

20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,590
I'm sorry, you see.

21
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,890
Are you serious?

22
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,590
Gosh, talk about dense...

23
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,890
How can you come to camp and forget the tent?

24
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,790
What a bummer.

25
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,990
It seems like he's lost too.

26
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,690
It's because you guys keep making a fuss on the side!

27
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,890
I guess we're going to be spending the night in the car...

28
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,090
What? Oh, no.

29
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,090
I'm sure there's a boarding facility somewhere.

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,090
Right!

31
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,890
Maybe some sort of castle by the lake?

32
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,390
Don't be silly.

33
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,290
Oh, they might be right.

34
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,290
Huh?

35
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,690
"The Old Blue Castle (Part 1)"

36
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,690
Wow!

37
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,290
It looks just like one of the castles they have abroad!

38
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,390
Why is there such a building in the forest?

39
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,990
Some rich person probably bought the castle abroad,

40
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,590
took it apart, and reassembled it here.

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,690
Okay!

42
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,590
Hey, what are you going to do?

43
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,690
What else? I'm going inside.

44
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,190
Hey! Where the heck are you from, kid?

45
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,990
Who gave you permission to come in here?

46
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,090
"Katsuo Tabata (41), Gardener"

47
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,290
Well, we're not bad people.

48
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,590
What's with all of you?

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,090
We saw this fantastic castle just as we were driving along here.

50
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,790
If it's okay with you, we thought

51
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,690
we'd like to have a look around the castle.

52
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,490
Go home! This is no place for outsiders to come...

53
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,490
Who are those people?

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,590
Sir.

55
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,890
I didn't think we'd have any guests today.

56
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,790
That dumb looking old man says he wants to come in.

57
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,390
Dumb looking?

58
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,990
I'm a scientist, you know!

59
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,490
Scientist?

60
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,690
Indeed!

61
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,890
I'm Hiroshi Agasa, a quite well-known inventor.

62
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,990
Which means that

63
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,390
your brain is way better than ours.

64
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,490
All right then, please come in!

65
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,490
In fact, why don't you may spend a night here if you like?

66
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,690
Oh, that would really be a great help!

67
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,390
But, sir!

68
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,790
You haven't asked the Mrs. whether it is okay yet.

69
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,290
Just tell her they're my friends.

70
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,890
In Mother-in-law's condition, that explanation will suffice.

71
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,190
-Oh, God... -Hey, Pops.

72
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,590
Let me down, will you?

73
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,490
Wow!

74
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,990
What a big yard!

75
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,390
It's a horse!

76
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,890
Oh, yeah! There's a black one here too!

77
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,490
But, why is only the neck here?

78
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,090
This horse is one of the men of chess.

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,690
Men of chess?

80
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,290
Not only the man.

81
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,390
Look at the grass under it.

82
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,390
It is has a checkered pattern, doesn't it?

83
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,090
It's cut in checkered pattern to serve as a chess board.

84
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,790
Your master likes chess too?

85
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,190
I wonder...

86
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,790
I take care of the yard just like I was ordered to

87
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,590
by my previous master, Sir Sadaaki,

88
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,990
and keep it in this condition.

89
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,090
Something about Sir Sadaaki was told to keep the yard in shape

90
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,490
by will of his father who passed away 15 year ago.

91
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,390
Your previous master?

92
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,290
Then, that man that we just saw is?

93
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,890
Oh, the madam's second husband called Mitsuru.

94
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,890
He came after Sir Sadaaki died 6 years ago of an illness.

95
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,090
But, she also died

96
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,590
because of a fire that broke out 4 years ago.

97
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,190
A big fire?

98
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,090
See, over there.

99
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,590
The burnt tower over there.

100
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,190
The madam's bedroom was there.

101
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,090
It was right after she returned to the tower

102
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,090
after celebrating her birthday party.

103
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,090
She arrived at the tower at midnight,

104
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,190
and fire occurred before daybreak.

105
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,990
Not only the madam,

106
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,090
the friends she brought,

107
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,190
the people who served her for many years,

108
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,990
as well as the stewards... over 10 people

109
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,790
were swallowed by the flames.

110
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,690
The ones who were not involved

111
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,890
were those like me, who had just been hired,

112
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,390
and her mother who had been sleeping in another building

113
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,190
because of a cold.

114
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,890
Also saved were Sir Mitsuru who came back here

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,090
a bit earlier than the madam.

116
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,690
And him, over there.

117
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,890
The only son of the Madam and Sir Sadaaki, Sir Takahito.

118
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,490
He came back suddenly 2 or 3 days

119
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,690
before the outbreak of the fire.

120
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,390
He seems to have been gone abroad since childhood,

121
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,990
and that was the first time that I ever saw him.

122
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,590
It was also the first time that I had met Sir Mitsuru.

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,090
The madam had gotten married abroad

124
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,190
and was living with him all the while.

125
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,290
And for some reason, ever since that fire,

126
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,590
Sir Takahito has remained back here.

127
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,090
It is as if he is obsessed by something.

128
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,390
They must have had a hard time getting into the castle.

129
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,890
Since nobody knew what they looked like.

130
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,490
No, the madam sent us the picture of Sir Mitsuru

131
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,390
when she remarried him,

132
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,390
that we all knew what he looked like.

133
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,190
As for Sir Takahito, it was this...

134
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,890
He looked just like his father.

135
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,690
Oh, I guess no one will doubt that he is his son, seeing this.

136
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,590
Who are the portraits on both sides?

137
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,090
They are Sir Sadaaki and the Madam.

138
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,990
Sir Sadaaki who came here as a son-in-law

139
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,390
taken into the family respected the previous master,

140
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,690
who was also a historian, very much.

141
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,790
Jealous of this,

142
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,890
Madam used to always complain to Sir Sadaaki saying...

143
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,190
Father is nothing more than an argumentative intellectual.

144
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,890
-Right? -Mrs. Mamiya?

145
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,590
He knew all about it too.

146
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,690
But, rather than being angry about it, he seemed happy.

147
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,190
I'm sorry for bringing back bad memories.

148
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,590
Don't worry about it.

149
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,690
I've gotten used to the castle without him.

150
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,090
It's like the size of the passport changing

151
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,490
and the picture on the 10,000 yen bill changing.

152
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,290
At first, you're not used to it,

153
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,090
but with time, you get used to it.

154
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,890
The passing of time is frightening.

155
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,990
It erases joy and sadness all at once.

156
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,490
Mrs. Mamiya...

157
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,890
By the way, who are they?

158
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,490
Well, he is a friend of Sir Mitsuru and a scientist as well.

159
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,890
A scientist?

160
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,090
Oh, that's very interesting.

161
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,990
I would sure like you to solve

162
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,390
the mystery that he buried within this castle.

163
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,090
Mystery?

164
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,690
Sir Mamiya seems to have remarked on his death bed that

165
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,990
he would give his most precious treasure

166
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,090
to the one who solves the mystery of this castle.

167
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,590
By the way, is my daughter back yet?

168
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,790
She supposed to be back today

169
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,990
to celebrate my birthday, isn't she?

170
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,990
Madam has...

171
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,390
Send her to my room as soon as she arrives.

172
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,090
Oh, how exciting...

173
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,590
She's been that way, ever since the fire.

174
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,190
She must've been really shocked by it.

175
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,290
Excuse me, sir.

176
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,390
Is there a room where I can get an overall view of the chess pieces in the yard?

177
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,090
The chess pieces in the yard?

178
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,190
Wow!

179
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,190
The chess pieces are nicely lined up in rows!

180
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,290
Hey! Where is it? I can't see it!

181
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,390
Hey, don't push, Genta!

182
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,690
You can see from here too!

183
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,290
Really?

184
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,790
Could there be a meaning as to

185
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,590
the way the pieces are lined up, or...

186
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,390
Aren't you glad?

187
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,490
They're codes, your favorite, aren't they?

188
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,390
-Or, aren't they? -Yes, I think they are, but...

189
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,790
Hey, you two over there! What are you doing?

190
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,790
You'll fall over!

191
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,490
Those idiots...

192
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,690
What the heck are you guys doing?

193
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,190
I almost fell over.

194
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,490
Oh, he fell.

195
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,390
What the...

196
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,490
Huh?

197
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,390
There is a window by the wall.

198
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,390
I'm sure there was

199
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,090
a window by the wall in the other room too.

200
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,690
Then, what is the space in between here?

201
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,990
From the days of old, these things

202
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,790
have a way of working if you match the needle somewhere...

203
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,990
Hey, Conan?

204
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,290
He was here a second ago, wasn't he?

205
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,190
Yeah...

206
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,090
I see. It's not an ordinary castle.

207
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,790
This is getting to be very interesting.

208
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,590
Oh, stairs.

209
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,390
Wow, it's pretty deep down.

210
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,390
I wonder how far down these stairs go.

211
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,990
This is...

212
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,380
What? Conan disappeared?

213
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,980
But, he was in that room till a while ago, wasn't he?

214
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
How should I know...

215
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,780
We were looking elsewhere, and he suddenly disappeared.

216
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,380
Impossible.

217
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,880
The chair is turned over and the books are scattered.

218
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
A clock with the lid open.

219
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
It's broken too.

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,680
-Huh? -Haibara?

221
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Hey!

222
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
Cut out your mischief.

223
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,480
Is anything wrong with the children?

224
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,680
Oh, no, they were just up to some mischief.

225
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
-Mischief? -No!

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,580
We were looking for Conan because he disappeared!

227
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,380
He disappeared?

228
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,480
He probably went to the restroom or something,

229
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,380
because it's right downstairs.

230
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,380
Let's go take a look.

231
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,880
He should at least tell us he's going to the restroom.

232
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,080
You can say that again.

233
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,980
How strange.

234
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,480
He's not in here.

235
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,380
Are there any other restrooms?

236
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,580
This is a floor we don't use very much, so this is the only one.

237
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,480
Maybe he's hiding somewhere and is planning to surprise us?

238
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,980
Possible. He's very childish at times very true.

239
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,180
Right!

240
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,580
You're kids too, my goodness.

241
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Sir Takahito, dinner is ready.

242
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,380
Oh, it's the late already.

243
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,180
I had them prepare your dinner too,

244
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,680
-but would you like to have dinner? -Really?

245
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,580
But we've got to look for Conan.

246
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,980
He'll be fine.

247
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,280
If he gets hungry enough, he'll come out.

248
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,180
Dig in!

249
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,580
It's nice having a cheerful dinner like this at times.

250
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,880
Yes. Ever since Mother died in that fire,

251
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,380
the number of guests who come here has decreased.

252
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,080
I've heard that you two have been residing here

253
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,980
since the fire broke out, why?

254
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,680
I was planning to live here

255
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,380
after I graduated from university to begin with...

256
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,980
I stayed here for a while because I was concerned about

257
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,880
my Mother-in-law who had lost her daughter.

258
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
But, as time passed, I came to take a liking

259
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,480
for this castle in which my wife was born and raised.

260
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I'll bet you took a liking not for the castle,

261
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,080
but the treasure that is hidden here, right?

262
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,580
Grandmother.

263
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,080
True indeed!

264
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,680
I can't say that the will of Father

265
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,980
has nothing to do with us being here.

266
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,180
To think that my daughter was deceived

267
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,380
by a greedy one as you!

268
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,180
I having dinner in my room!

269
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,380
Bring my daughter to my room when she arrives!

270
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,080
I've got to give her a piece of my mind!

271
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,780
Grandmother still thinks that Mother is alive.

272
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,680
It's only natural that her memory isn't clear.

273
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,980
After she hurt her leg,

274
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,280
she's been confined to this castle for more than 10 years.

275
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,180
And? Did you solve the mystery, Dr. Agasa?

276
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,280
Oh? You haven't heard about it yet?

277
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,380
About what Father said at his death bed,

278
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,480
I will give away my most precious treasure

279
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,680
to the one who solves the mystery of this castle.

280
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Oh, the gardener Mr. Tabata told me about it.

281
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,280
But, I don't know where to look for what...

282
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,780
The chess pieces lined out in the yard.

283
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,380
If that chess board in the yard

284
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,280
was made by the same person who hid the treasure,

285
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,780
there's no doubt that the hint to solving the mystery

286
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,080
is hidden in the chess pieces.

287
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,680
Are you sure, Ai?

288
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,780
Have you figured out the meaning of those pieces?

289
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,780
Of course not.

290
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,580
How could I figure out what you people couldn't, even after 4 years?

291
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,280
The only one who can probably solve the mystery

292
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,480
is the super curious, mystery gourmet,

293
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,880
who has disappeared somewhere within this castle.

294
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,880
-Mystery... -Gourmet?

295
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,480
Here's the bag! Will this do?

296
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,180
Thank you!

297
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,280
What are you going to do with the bag?

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I'm saving my piece of bread for Conan.

299
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,480
Because I'm sure he'll be hungry.

300
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,580
What happened to the boy with the glasses?

301
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,880
He's been gone for some time now.

302
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
We're going to look for him after we finish dinner.

303
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,780
This castle is quite complicated,

304
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,280
so he's probably lost somewhere.

305
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I hope he's not lost in that tower, though.

306
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,480
That tower?

307
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,280
See, the one to the left of this castle?

308
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,280
That tower that is burnt black and surrounded by greenery.

309
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,880
The one that my wife burned to death in, 4 years ago...

310
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Yes, it was 2 years ago

311
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,580
that a new servant who was hired here,

312
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,880
disappeared in a night.

313
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,280
I have heard that he used to say,

314
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,180
"There is something in that tower".

315
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,880
He used to tell his a fellow servant so.

316
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,180
Therefore, we searched the tower immediately.

317
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,380
Although there were signs of somebody having been there,

318
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,480
he was nowhere in sight,

319
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,880
so the local police searched the entire forest after that.

320
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,380
And, what after that?

321
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,180
He was found 10 days later in the forest,

322
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,180
starved to death.

323
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,880
What happened?

324
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,680
I wonder.

325
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,580
The police concluded that he got lost in the forest,

326
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,380
and that it was an accident,

327
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,980
but among the servants,

328
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,780
a weird rumor went around for a while.

329
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,480
That the dead souls of my wife

330
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,180
and those who burned to death there, possessed him.

331
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,080
The entrance of that tower has been sealed off since.

332
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,980
Then, we've got to hurry and look for him

333
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,480
or Conan will be hungry and...

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,580
I... I'll save my bread for him too.

335
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,080
Me too.

336
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,680
Let's split up and look for him, before daybreak.

337
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey, Conan!

338
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,480
Where are you?

339
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,080
Stop hiding and come out!

340
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,980
He doesn't seem to be in the yard!

341
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,480
We looked all over inside the castle too,

342
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,580
but he was nowhere in sight.

343
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,880
Maybe he's in that tower after all.

344
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,180
No,

345
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,080
I just went there, but the door was locked.

346
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,280
Which means the only place left is the forest.

347
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,180
But, it's starting to rain harder.

348
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,780
It's dangerous to go into the forest at night.

349
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,480
It'll be better to look for him

350
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,580
after calling the police tomorrow.

351
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,480
So, all of you, go back inside.

352
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,980
-What? -No way.

353
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,180
Ayumi?

354
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Conan!

355
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,480
He'll be fine.

356
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,080
Conan is not a weakling

357
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,980
so you needn't worry yourself over him.

358
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,580
He's capable of finding his own escape route for himself.

359
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
If you got time to cry like a baby,

360
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,780
why don't you carry that bag of bread nice and tight

361
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,780
so that it doesn't get soaked in the rain?

362
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
-Hey! -You'll catch a cold!

363
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,080
Come on, let's go.

364
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,380
Why do you know so much about Conan?

365
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,680
Well, I wonder why?

366
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,480
Do you by chance...

367
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,380
happen to like Conan?

368
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,580
If so, then what?

369
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,380
What... I wouldn't want it to be that way.

370
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,080
Don't worry. I don't feel for him in that way at all.

371
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,280
Really?

372
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,980
What a relief!

373
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,780
You really, really mean it, right?

374
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,180
I tell you, the kids nowadays...

375
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,680
But, just as you say,

376
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,580
Shinichi will take care of himself!

377
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,180
Like they say, no news is good news.

378
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,780
Come of it.

379
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,980
Do you think that he'd make you go through needless worry,

380
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,680
by not contacting you for hours?

381
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,980
Something has definitely fell upon him.

382
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,080
He's either been confined by someone in this castle

383
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,180
and can't get out,

384
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,180
or maybe he's already...

385
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,880
been killed.

386
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Hey...

387
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,180
We've got to contact the police without letting

388
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,780
the people of this castle know,

389
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,180
and look into every nit and gritty for him.

390
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,280
We've got to look for him, not in the forest

391
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,180
but in this castle.

392
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,580
I've already got an idea.

393
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Shape up, Doc.

394
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,980
Without him here, you're the only one we can depend on,

395
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,080
being that you're an adult.

396
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,380
Let's see...

397
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,680
The phone...

398
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,980
Oh, there it is!

399
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,880
This is Shinichi's cap...

400
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,880
What's this door?

401
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,780
What is this supposed to be?

402
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,680
Doc? If you're going to call,

403
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,780
you may as well call someone that we know,

404
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,680
like Officer Yokomizo or Inspector Megure...

405
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,980
Doc?

406
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,780
Doc...
