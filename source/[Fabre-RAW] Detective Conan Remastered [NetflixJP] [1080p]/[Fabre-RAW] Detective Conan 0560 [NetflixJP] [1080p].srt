1
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:03,983
The House of Hope.

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:08,756
Six talented young people used to live there in the past.

3
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:10,256
However, three years ago

4
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:13,993
when one of the women there died of a heart attack,

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:18,456
people began calling the House of Hope the House of Death instead.

6
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:22,001
Another tragedy occurs at the house.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
The husband of the woman who died,

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,556
called Mr. Shusaku Akashi

9
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:29,756
was found locked up and starved to death in one of the rooms.

10
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,011
Just before he passed on,

11
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:36,556
Mr. Akashi painted the wall on one side entirely red.

12
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:40,019
What on earth does this mean?

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,656
We deduced that the culprit

14
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:45,156
must be among the four who used to live in the house in the past,

15
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:47,556
and went to talk to the suspects together

16
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,029
with Inspector Takaaki Morofushi, rival to Inspector Yamato

17
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,031
of the Nagano Prefectural Police Station.

18
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,056
Among them, Mr. Shiro Naoki acted quite suspiciously.

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,256
So, we visited his apartment again the following day,

20
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:02,556
but found that Naoki was murdered.

21
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:05,056
Just like Mr. Akashi, he was seated in a chair,

22
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:08,556
facing the wall that was painted red.

23
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:09,756
The only difference was,

24
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:14,053
the chair that Naoki was seated on was not painted white,

25
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,656
and that there was no black chair in the room.

26
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,556
Moreover, it looked to be that the culprit,

27
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:22,956
not the victim had painted the wall.

28
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:26,656
Is the killer challenging the police?

29
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:27,856
Or...

30
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,856
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

31
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:34,356
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

32
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:36,356
Inspector Koume is attacked by the culprit.

33
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,756
The mystery of the red wall is finally solved.

34
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,079
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:42,081
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,556
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

37
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:32,191
But, if you don't want him to go all out when investigating,

38
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,452
why don't you go along with him?

39
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,352
I think he wants to watch him in hiding.

40
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,752
Last night when we went to look over the place

41
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,452
where Inspector Morofushi and the suspects were,

42
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,752
there was a strange car following us too.

43
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,207
That's a car from the police, right?

44
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,452
Yeah.

45
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,552
But why would you want to keep watch?

46
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:54,752
We just told you that the three in question

47
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,152
knew about the red wall that was left behind at the scene, right?

48
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:04,223
Of course, we police personnel know of the facts.

49
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,952
Moreover, if that guy liked Aoi Kobashi

50
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:09,952
and worked at the police station,

51
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,231
wouldn't it be natural to keep watch over him?

52
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,552
Then, don't tell me...

53
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:18,952
Yeah. Takaaki Morofushi

54
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:21,552
is also a suspect!

55
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:28,552
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Koume Dies)"

56
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:35,152
What? You mean? Really, are you serious?

57
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:38,257
Yeah, so I'd like to confirm...

58
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,852
Where and what were you doing

59
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,652
between 10:00 to 11:00 last night?

60
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:43,852
About that time,

61
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:47,852
I was in my room reading the script for my next drama.

62
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,752
When I completed it and went to bed,

63
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:53,252
I think it was after 2:00 am.

64
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,275
I mean, don't tell me you're suspecting me?

65
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,752
This is just in case.

66
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:02,281
Can somebody testify for you?

67
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,552
My wife was already sleeping at 9:00 pm, so...

68
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:08,287
But a family member cannot testify for you.

69
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:12,552
Was there something strange about Shiro recently?

70
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,552
Like, him being jittery or something.

71
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:17,852
I wonder because I haven't seen him for a while.

72
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:20,752
But, Shusaku seems to have been seeing him frequently.

73
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:24,303
It seems that Shiro's band was not doing well.

74
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,052
And Shusaku said that he used to come frequently,

75
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:28,852
begging for money.

76
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,052
Oh.

77
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:36,652
What was I doing last night between 10:00 and 11:00?

78
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:41,152
Oh my, so you suspect me of having killed Shiro too?

79
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,952
You suspect me too, you say?

80
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:45,752
An officer with slant eyes and a mustache came last night

81
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:48,952
and asked me the same question, so this is what I told him!

82
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:53,252
"I was here alone designing, bug you?"

83
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,752
That Koume, beat me to it.

84
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,752
Koume...

85
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:01,452
you mean the name of that officer is Koume?

86
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,852
Yeah! His nickname is Koume,

87
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:07,152
a classmate of Aoi Kobashi that you know well too!

88
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:11,052
Then, the famous detective who appeared in Aoi's book is...

89
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:16,052
And? That man Shiro Naoki, was he acting strange recently?

90
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:20,359
I wonder... I heard that he was having money problems but...

91
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,652
Oh, that's right!

92
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,363
He was saying he was going to take a trip abroad!

93
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:28,367
I asked him if he could come up with the cash needed to travel too.

94
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:33,252
Gosh, an officer again?

95
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:36,375
Like I just said a while ago, from 10:00 to 13:00 last night

96
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:39,552
I was crashed out on the sofa in the next room.

97
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,381
So, Koume already came here too.

98
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,552
Then, can anyone testify for you?

99
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:50,752
Try asking my friends who came to wake me up every hour!

100
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,952
Well, I did have a blanket over me,

101
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:57,552
so they may not be able to tell you if I was really there or not.

102
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,652
Then, was Mr. Shiro Naoki

103
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,152
acting strange or something lately?

104
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:04,752
Beats me.

105
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:08,407
It was some time ago that he came to persistently beg me for money.

106
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:12,152
So, I bawled him out and never saw him since.

107
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:14,952
Oh, but it seems he came up with the money.

108
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:18,417
He was saying that he was going to a place in Italy called Lecce.

109
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,052
He sent me a mail saying that

110
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:23,252
"If I'm gone, try searching me there."

111
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:25,152
Lecce in Italy?

112
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:28,752
By the way, is it true that the slant eyed, officer with a mustache

113
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,752
is the model for the famous detective

114
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,352
that appears in the book that Aoi wrote?

115
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,435
Yeah but, how did you know?

116
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:39,552
Because Yamabuki called me just a while ago,

117
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:42,441
saying that Midorikawa was surprised too.

118
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:49,852
We went around asking the three suspects questions

119
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,852
but all three of them virtually had no alibi.

120
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,052
Right.

121
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:58,457
We have to solve the mystery of red wall after all.

122
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,852
Red wall.

123
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:05,352
If that was really Mr. Shusaku Akashi's dying message,

124
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:09,152
why did he paint the entire wall red?

125
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,052
I can see why he didn't leave the culprit's name behind

126
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,952
so that everyone could obviously see it, but...

127
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:29,352
Right, he didn't leave the culprit's name behind

128
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:33,952
because it's most likely that the culprit would be the first one

129
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:35,752
to come visit here, after he starved to death.

130
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:39,552
That means he was afraid that the culprit would find it and erase it...

131
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,852
Erase...

132
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,052
red...

133
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:43,252
wall...

134
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,052
Wall?

135
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:08,527
I see.

136
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:34,252
Koume is not necessary in this murder performance.

137
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:37,052
I need you to leave soon.

138
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:42,561
What? You lost track of Koume?

139
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,352
What the heck do you think you're doing, Uehara?

140
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,152
Sorry! Just as we were entering Gojo Forest,

141
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,252
he suddenly stepped on the gas and...

142
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:53,252
Gojo Forest is where that house is!

143
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,352
I'm sure Koume's headed for the house!

144
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:56,575
Go there on the double!

145
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,252
Yes, sir!

146
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:01,752
A mail from Koume.

147
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,583
Maybe he figured out who the culprit is.

148
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,252
What? What's written?

149
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:13,952
Koume... dies...

150
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:18,152
That doesn't sound very pleasant.

151
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,152
Hey, Uehara, did you find Koume?

152
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:25,952
Well, I just arrived at the house now, but...

153
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:32,252
It's on fire... the House of Death!

154
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:35,452
What? The house is on fire?

155
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,252
What?

156
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:39,952
And, Koume? What about Koume?

157
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,852
I don't know,

158
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,352
although his car was parked in front of the house.

159
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:49,152
The house was already in flames when I got here!

160
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:50,629
Koume, don't tell me that you...

161
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:54,052
He beat us to it, again.

162
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,052
Inspector Morofushi!

163
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,088
Ko... Koume.

164
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,388
If he's in there, he's probably already...

165
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,288
Oh, no.

166
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,288
As soon as I solve the mystery of the case,

167
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,671
I'll contact you first thing.

168
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:37,488
Koume, you haven't contacted me and reported on the case yet!

169
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,688
Darn it!

170
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,388
Hey, you?

171
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,681
Don't, Inspector Yamato!

172
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,988
No use going in now.

173
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:48,188
Shut up! You can't tell unless you go in.

174
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:50,988
Look.

175
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:55,088
I don't think there's any point in going in now, is there?

176
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,088
Ko... Koume!

177
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,588
Hey! What happened?

178
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:06,705
I went around the backdoor because it wasn't on fire yet,

179
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:08,707
and found him in that room in question.

180
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,288
He seems to have been hit by someone.

181
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:14,713
Koume, who was it? Who did this to you?

182
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:18,717
No use. He completely passed out.

183
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,788
But, he was struck on the back of his head.

184
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,788
If he was attacked from behind,

185
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,588
he may not have seen the attacker.

186
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:31,388
But, maybe the attacker is one of the people that are here.

187
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,888
Hey. What brings you all here?

188
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,088
Well, you see.

189
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,088
We were summoned.

190
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,188
By cell phone text mail.

191
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:40,739
By text mail?

192
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,741
Who sent you the mail?

193
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,088
You, inspector.

194
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,745
What?

195
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,388
It said that you wanted us to come here

196
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:52,751
because you wanted to confirm something at this house where Shusaku died.

197
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,088
Am I right?

198
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,488
Yes. At 14:00.

199
00:12:56,488 --> 00:13:00,088
And, when we got here, the house was up in flames.

200
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:04,388
Didn't you think it was strange that I would send you mail?

201
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:07,088
Well, it did bother me a bit but...

202
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:10,769
When I called the two, they said they both got the same mail so...

203
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,488
The contents and the mail address were the same

204
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,788
so I had no doubts.

205
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,388
Then, you all came together?

206
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:21,488
No. It said to come alone.

207
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,388
That's what was written in the mail.

208
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:33,688
"Arano Hospital"

209
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,788
Mr. Shiro Naoki's cell phone?

210
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:41,388
The text mail was sent to the three from his cell phone?

211
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,588
Yeah.

212
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,188
The culprit probably after killing Shiro Naoki,

213
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:48,588
stole his cell phone, changed the mail address

214
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:52,811
and sent the same mail to all of them including himself.

215
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,588
I see.

216
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:56,815
The suspects are

217
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,588
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, Mr. Shoji Yamabuki

218
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:03,288
and Mr. Takuto Momose.

219
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,488
By summoning the other two,

220
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:08,188
the culprit wouldn't be the only one without an alibi

221
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:10,829
when the house was set on fire.

222
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,188
But, why did the culprit have to set fire to the house?

223
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,288
Maybe he figured it out?

224
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,839
That the dying message of the red wall that Mr. Akashi painted

225
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,888
indicated who he was!

226
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:27,188
So, he decided to burn the house down.

227
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:29,388
And Koume unfortunately happened to be there.

228
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,188
Therefore, the culprit had no choice

229
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:35,988
but to knock him down and decided to burn him to ashes house and all.

230
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:36,855
And?

231
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:39,688
What is the meaning of that red wall?

232
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,188
You've figured it out, haven't you?

233
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:43,788
I wish.

234
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:48,867
Deadly attack Drill Punch!

235
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,869
Conan!

236
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:55,488
Talking like you know it all when you don't know a thing!

237
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:58,888
Well, the first murder site was burned to ashes,

238
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,688
but we got another hint.

239
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:05,588
The message that Koume sent to my cell phone.

240
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:10,088
Koume dies.

241
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:14,188
But, it could be that the culprit deliberately sent it to you.

242
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:15,988
I don't think so.

243
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:18,588
Because that message is cut part way

244
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,688
and it also says that he will contact Inspector Yamato

245
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,688
when he solves the mystery.

246
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,988
That's why I think that Inspector Morofushi who got hold of something

247
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:29,788
was planning to inform Inspector Yamato about it by mail

248
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:31,788
but got attacked by the culprit.

249
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:35,688
I think he tried to send it out before he passed out.

250
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:38,288
Why did he stop part way?

251
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,688
Maybe the culprit sent it as a pun

252
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,588
using the name of the great strategist Koume Shokatsuryo,

253
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,488
and the nickname of Inspector Takaaki Morofushi, Koume

254
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,388
and sent it?

255
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:48,488
The message, "Koume dies".

256
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:51,888
"Koume's men follow his orders even after his death!"

257
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:54,933
Huh? What does that mean?

258
00:15:54,933 --> 00:16:01,388
Seeing strategist Koume Zhuge Liang's men (Shoku) stopped battle,

259
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,488
the general of (Gi) the opposing forces, Yi Sima

260
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:05,988
who confirmed that Koume had died of an illness,

261
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:08,388
immediately counter-attacked with a large number of men

262
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:11,488
but since Koume's men, stuck to orders given by Koume

263
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:14,588
as if he were still alive, and showed signs of counter-attacking,

264
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:16,955
the men of the opposing forces believed that Koume was not dead,

265
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,888
and suspected that this was some kind of strategy against them,

266
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,488
so they retreated!

267
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:26,088
In other words, the power and influence of a person

268
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,388
will keep his opponents in fear even after death.

269
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,688
Which means that "Koume dies"

270
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:36,288
refers to Mr. Shusaku Akashi who was starved to death

271
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,988
and "living men" refer to the culprit.

272
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:39,988
In other words, Mr. Akashi

273
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:44,088
was trying to scare the culprit using the red wall,

274
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:47,688
and white and black chairs that were nailed to the floor.

275
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:49,988
It's difficult to figure out what his intention was.

276
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:53,388
Yeah. And more so what baffles me is...

277
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,995
why did the culprit deliberately leave only

278
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:02,088
the message using the red wall behind, when he murdered Shiro Naoki.

279
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:06,188
If that was a message to provoke the police...

280
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:08,688
Was he all that sure,

281
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,788
that the police would never figure out it was him

282
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,188
just by looking at the red wall?

283
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,788
Was he all that confident?

284
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,788
I wonder if the culprit's motive for killing

285
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,488
was really for Aoi?

286
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:23,788
Could it be that it had to do with something red,

287
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,588
so he painted the wall red?

288
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:29,027
No doubt his motive was to avenge Aoi's death.

289
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,388
I told you, didn't I?

290
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:31,888
That when Aoi had a heart attack

291
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:35,488
at the warehouse of that house three years ago,

292
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:40,288
she died because her husband Shusaku Akashi left her there to die.

293
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,388
It's exactly the same as

294
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:44,488
when Shusaku Akashi was locked in the room

295
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:47,788
and left to starve to death.

296
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,688
But, I don't think that's enough.

297
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:52,388
On the day that Aoi passed away,

298
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,488
it seems that the three suspects

299
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:57,688
as well as Mr. Shiro Naoki who was killed last night,

300
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,788
got a call from Aoi,

301
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,888
asking them if they remembered where her husband Shusaku

302
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:07,088
put the drawing that she modeled for him for.

303
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,067
So, the thing that Aoi was looking for in the warehouse

304
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,688
on the day that she died was...

305
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:15,488
Yes. She was looking for her portrait.

306
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:18,588
She also seems to have asked Shusaku for its whereabouts,

307
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:21,079
but he practically ignored her

308
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,388
saying he was busy working on a piece of artwork.

309
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,288
It seems that Aoi used to take that portrait out

310
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:32,388
on her birthday every year and hang it in her room.

311
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:35,088
She died a day before her birthday

312
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:38,888
so it's not surprising if someone held a grudge against what happened.

313
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:42,088
Well, if Koume regains consciousness,

314
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,488
we'll know whether this "Koume Dies"

315
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:47,388
was sent by Koume himself or not too.

316
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:51,109
If it's so, I can understand the meaning but...

317
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:53,111
According to the doctor,

318
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,888
he says that if Koume doesn't regain consciousness by tomorrow,

319
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:57,888
they'll re-examine him again.

320
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,117
I see.

321
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,088
Sorry that although I asked you to come all the way out here,

322
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,988
you practically have no chance to do your thing.

323
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:10,288
Oh no, I'm sorry that I can't be of much help.

324
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:11,888
After all,

325
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,888
I guess the one that you really wanted to call over

326
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:17,135
was this glasses kid, right?

327
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,137
Yeah. I thought that the boy

328
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:23,141
would be just the right one to keep watch over Koume.

329
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,888
Because once he starts making deductions,

330
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:28,388
he gets so engrossed in it that he loses track of his surroundings,

331
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:29,147
and once he makes up his mind,

332
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:32,588
he'll cross a dangerous bridge as if it were nothing.

333
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,988
So, even if he won't listen to you or me,

334
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,488
I figured that he may lend an ear to the warnings

335
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:40,388
of an innocent kid.

336
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,488
But, he fled off on his own again this time

337
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:44,088
and did it again.

338
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:47,488
I'm so sorry that I'm not of much use.

339
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:50,488
Well, if I figure out the mystery of the red wall,

340
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,288
I'll let you know first thing.

341
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:53,171
Yeah.

342
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:57,188
Doctor, how's my wife?

343
00:19:57,188 --> 00:20:01,179
She'll be fine! The surgery was a success.

344
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,088
What's wrong, Ran?

345
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:05,788
Oh, well, I was just wondering why surgical gowns

346
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,788
are all light green colored!

347
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:10,588
-Huh? -You see,

348
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:14,388
all the other doctors and nurses wear white lab coats, don't they?

349
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,988
True but why now?

350
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:22,588
Well, the incident this time has to do with color, right?

351
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,203
So, I was thinking about color.

352
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,788
Oh, I know why!

353
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:30,288
Surgical gowns are light green

354
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:33,211
because during surgery you see a lot of blood.

355
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,788
If you keep looking at the blood...

356
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:37,488
The after image of the color...

357
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,788
Makes you lose concentration.

358
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,588
I get it!

359
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:51,488
Only looking at this red wall

360
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:55,233
will not lead to figuring out what the dying message is!

361
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,235
You can only figure out the message

362
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:00,888
by considering the white wall a pair!

363
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:03,888
What's wrong, both of you?

364
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:10,388
The mysterious incident that occurred at the House of Hope.

365
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:13,251
The illustrator, Mr. Shusaku Akashi who lived in that house

366
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,788
was locked in his room and starved to death.

367
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:19,257
Strangely, one side of the wall at the site,

368
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,088
was painted entirely red by Mr. Akashi.

369
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,788
There were two chairs

370
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:27,265
one black and one white nailed to the floor.

371
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:30,788
Mr. Akashi was found dead seated in the white chair

372
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,688
facing the red wall.

373
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:37,988
This seems to be a dying message left behind by Mr. Akashi.

374
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:39,277
The start of the incident seemed to be

375
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,488
because of a grudge held against Mr. Akashi

376
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:45,788
for leaving his wife, maiden name Aoi Kobashi

377
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:48,588
to die of a heart attack three years ago in the warehouse.

378
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:50,488
That was not the end of the incident, though,

379
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:53,291
as soon as we started the investigation,

380
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,688
a former resident of the house, Mr. Shiro Naoki

381
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:59,088
was murdered at his apartment.

382
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,688
Moreover, his body was seated in a chair,

383
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:05,588
and the door of the closet in front of him was painted red.

384
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,888
Yes. The culprit had reproduced

385
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:12,088
the scene of when Mr. Akashi's dead body was found.

386
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:15,088
Could he be challenging the police?

387
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:17,888
The suspects are three of the six

388
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:21,319
who are still alive that used to live in the house before.

389
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:23,888
Actor Mr. Naoki Midorikawa.

390
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:29,088
Fashion designer Mr. Shoji Yamabuki

391
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,388
and CG creator Mr. Takuto Momose.

392
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,988
That person's name is undoubtedly

393
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,788
indicated in Mr. Shusaku Akashi's dying message!

394
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,500
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,480
"Italy"

396
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,392
Talking of Italy...

397
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,427
What comes to mind is of course wine.

398
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,340
Red, white and rose.

399
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,429
Is drinking all you can think of?
