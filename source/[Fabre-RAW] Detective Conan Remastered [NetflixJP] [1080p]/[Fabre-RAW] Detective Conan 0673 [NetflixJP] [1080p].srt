1
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:06,327
A mysterious case begins with what seemingly looks

2
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:10,427
to be a simple request through the website of the Detective Agency.

3
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:13,993
Don't tell me that...

4
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:19,127
What?

5
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:26,027
The man who confined Ms. Kei Kashizuka,

6
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,627
who had come to the detective agency to talk about her request,

7
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:32,427
committed suicide right before her eyes.

8
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:37,527
We give Kei a lift home after she finishes going through interrogation,

9
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:40,927
and find many wiretaps set up there.

10
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:44,827
While everyone continues looking for wiretaps,

11
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:55,527
I left the condo together with Kei

12
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:57,727
who said that she was going out shopping,

13
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,927
was given juice laced with a sleeping drug,

14
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,027
and put to sleep!

15
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:07,127
Ran, who finds out about this, contacts Doc

16
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:10,049
and decides to have him come after me using the pursuit glasses.

17
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:13,627
However, since Doc's Beetle was out for repair,

18
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:16,055
they decide to pursue me together with Subaru Okiya,

19
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,927
who just happened to be there on his car.

20
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:21,627
Masumi, who also hears of this,

21
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:24,627
decides to join Ran and the others but...

22
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:28,727
Welcome.

23
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:30,069
Fill it up, regular.

24
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:31,227
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:51,327
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to use the restroom.

26
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:52,927
Sure.

27
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,095
Go into the station and it's to the right beyond.

28
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,427
Thank you.

29
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:13,027
The vivid colored memories of summer

30
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:15,027
solve mysteries all season round.

31
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:16,827
Conan Edogawa is kidnapped.

32
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:19,127
The culprit is surprised at his detailed deduction.

33
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:20,727
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:22,827
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,327
His name is Detective Conan.

36
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,810
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Deduction)"

37
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,610
They've started moving again.

38
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,910
This time they're going south along Ooishi Highway

39
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,910
and headed in the direction of Toriyacho.

40
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,239
Roger.

41
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,710
I don't think we'll be able to catch up with them for a while yet.

42
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,010
But, I wonder where the culprit is headed for?

43
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,249
It kind of looks like she's driving around lost.

44
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:33,610
Maybe she's actually lost.

45
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,810
Not being able to find

46
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,510
the blood smeared destination that she's searching for.

47
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,110
Darn!

48
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,810
The computer is locked.

49
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,269
You can't open it unless you have the password.

50
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,271
Seriously.

51
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,010
Why would anyone do something so humbug like this?

52
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,310
Then, maybe we should try something

53
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,310
that would rhyme with Kei Kashizuka.

54
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,710
Well...

55
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,610
How do you two handle your passwords?

56
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,310
My birthday...

57
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,810
As for me... (it's Kogoro-san in figures-5563)

58
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,610
No... I mean when it's a very long password

59
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,610
that is hard to remember.

60
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,010
I key it in to the memo pad of my cell phone.

61
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,610
I would write it on a piece of paper

62
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,810
and put it in a place like this, that no one would see.

63
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,710
I found it! I got the password!

64
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,311
Fantastic, Dad.

65
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,610
Just as would be expected of you!

66
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,317
The number you have called is switched off

67
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,710
or out of service range.

68
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,410
What's going on?

69
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,310
Why aren't any of the three answering?

70
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,327
Would you like me to find her?

71
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,910
The woman that you're looking for.

72
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,333
Kid? How come?

73
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:58,337
Oh, I didn't drink the juice with a sleeping drug in it

74
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,710
that you bought for me

75
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,510
because I spilled half of it under the seat.

76
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,410
I did that because when I opened the cap,

77
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,610
it didn't have the sound that cap's have when the bottle is newly opened.

78
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,349
That's because you opened it once,

79
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,010
and put something inside the bottle, right?

80
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,810
At any rate, if you want to look for the people you're after,

81
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,359
we should go meet them in person!

82
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,810
The three people you were calling on the phone just now,

83
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,610
are registered on the internet,

84
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,810
so we can find their address right away.

85
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,369
You want to kill the woman, don't you?

86
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,810
Serina Urakawa.

87
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,910
Why do you know my name?

88
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,110
I found out through the scratched up cell phone

89
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,379
that you're holding right now!

90
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,381
There wouldn't be so many scratches on it

91
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,210
unless you handle it roughly on a daily basis

92
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,710
or carry it around in your pocket with other hard things.

93
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,410
In the pocket of the coat that you covered me with just a while ago,

94
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,393
there were only that cell phone, a wallet,

95
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,510
and the case for sleeping pills.

96
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,910
There were no scratches on the wallet or the case.

97
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,110
Which means that's actually the cell phone

98
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,110
that belonged to the man who was found dead

99
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,110
in the restroom of the detective agency,

100
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,210
and you switched it with the cell phone

101
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,810
that you brought along with you, right?

102
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,510
That man had a lot of loose change in his pocket,

103
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,410
and though the lighter and the wallet he had inside together

104
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,010
were all scratched up,

105
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,310
there were no scratches on the cell phone.

106
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,110
The stun gun was inside too,

107
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,610
but there were no scratches on it either.

108
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,210
You brought that along with you too, didn't you?

109
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,810
Don't be silly. You saw too, didn't you, kid?

110
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,910
That I was tied up with masking tape.

111
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,510
How could I ever switch my own cell phone

112
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,310
for the one of the man who was threatening me with his gun?

113
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,210
It's easy to tie yourself up with masking tape!

114
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,710
After pulling out the tape,

115
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,449
you hook the hole in the middle of the roll of masking tape

116
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,451
onto the doorknob of the restroom.

117
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:57,810
And after pulling it taut you wrap yourself around with the tape.

118
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,459
The masking tape was wrapped onto you from your elbow up.

119
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,461
So you could use both hands.

120
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,010
After cutting the tape,

121
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,210
you could remove the tape from the doorknob.

122
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,510
If you use your mouth,

123
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,710
you could wrap the tape around your wrists too.

124
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,310
Then are you saying

125
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,010
that I shot that man to death?

126
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,210
The light turned green.

127
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,910
I think it's too difficult for you to understand, kid.

128
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,710
But on the hands and sleeves of the person who fires a gun.

129
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,010
There is gun residue.

130
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,110
When a gun is fired, lead, tin, antimony, barium,

131
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,110
and nitrite scatter in all directions and they stick on to the clothes

132
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,210
and body of the one who fired the gun.

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,505
You probably made the man that you attacked with the stun gun

134
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,210
hold the gun in his hand, put the gun barrel in his mouth

135
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,610
and made him sit on the toilet seat.

136
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,910
Then you unlaced the shoelace of your boot,

137
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,810
and pulled in through the trigger from the backside of the man's hand,

138
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,510
then you pulled the shoelace through the inside

139
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,610
of the toilet seat to the outside and let it hang down.

140
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,527
After that you covered your head with a towel

141
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,210
to avoid getting gun residue on you.

142
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,610
Then, you wet one end of the other towel

143
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,010
and placed it below the grip

144
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,410
so that the gun wouldn't slip.

145
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,610
Next all you had to do was,

146
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,110
cover the shoelace that is hanging out of the toilet seat,

147
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,510
and you're all set.

148
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,545
After sending mail to Detective Mouri

149
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,510
telling him to virtually keep out of the restroom,

150
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,310
you held your boots down with your knees while pulling the shoelace.

151
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,910
The gun would be fired,

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,310
and by the impact, the man would lurch backwards towards the wall.

153
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,810
If you remove the shoelace and towel before we ran into the restroom

154
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,610
after hearing the gun shot,

155
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,010
it would look like the man who brought you into the restroom,

156
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,110
was cornered and shot himself to death.

157
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,110
As proof of this,

158
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,310
when Amuro asked you about the cause of your older brother's death,

159
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,210
you didn't answer right away, right?

160
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,010
By the way, how did your older brother pass away?

161
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,510
What was the cause of your brother's death?

162
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,410
Yes.

163
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,589
That's because your right eardrum is damaged,

164
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,610
and you can't hear clearly

165
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,610
when talked at from the right side.

166
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,610
When firing a gun,

167
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,599
if you bring your left ear close to the man's lap,

168
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,603
you can guard it, but you can't protect your right ear.

169
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,310
In other words, Kei Kashizuka who called to ask Pops

170
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,609
to look for the locker that the key belonged to

171
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,010
was that man.

172
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,910
And the one who came to the Mouri Detective Agency

173
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,617
after luring Detective Mouri out of his office

174
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,619
and acted as an employee of the agency

175
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,910
to welcome the man was you.

176
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,910
I guess you were planning to lure the man out

177
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,910
to another place in order to interrogate him,

178
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,210
but since he was about to figure out you weren't an employee of the agency,

179
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,410
you had no choice but to pass him out using the stun gun.

180
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,637
But, it was impossible for you

181
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,410
to carry that man out to another place alone.

182
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,310
Although you could've taken the man's cell phone

183
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,910
on the spot and kill him,

184
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,210
you figured if the people of the neighborhood

185
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,310
heard the gun shot and came rushing over

186
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,410
you wouldn't be able to flee even if you wanted to.

187
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,810
So you dragged the man to the restroom

188
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,410
and set up the trick you carried out a while ago, right?

189
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,910
By doing so, you figured the police would let you go for the time being,

190
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,310
and you could use the cell phone you took from the man

191
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,410
to search that for the person you were after.

192
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,010
What's with you?

193
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,710
Who are you anyway?

194
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,671
Conan Edogawa.

195
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,673
A detective.

196
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,679
What's with you?

197
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,583
Who are you anyway?

198
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,685
Conan Edogawa.

199
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,183
A detective.

200
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:50,689
Detective?

201
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,683
Look, look ahead, it's a red light!

202
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:02,701
Then, you figured out what my name was,

203
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,383
because you saw the cash card in my wallet?

204
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:08,983
Nope. I didn't know it was your card.

205
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,883
But, I found out a lot after checking the internet.

206
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:14,283
In order to make everybody believe

207
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,715
that the cell phone you stole from the man was your own,

208
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,283
you forwarded just one picture to use as the standby display

209
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:19,283
for the man's cell phone.

210
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:22,983
The man in the standby display was Kenya Shono,

211
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:27,383
the bank clerk who was killed by the bank robber the other day.

212
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,729
I also figured that you're probably

213
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,483
looking for the three robbers.

214
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:38,083
Hidden under the bed of the bedroom of Mr. Kashizuka's condo

215
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,741
that you took us unwillingly to...

216
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,383
the small framed man that was found there

217
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:47,283
was also one of the robbers.

218
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,583
The second one was the man of hefty physique

219
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,783
that died at the detective agency, called Kei Kashizuka.

220
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:56,083
And, it seemed that you,

221
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,983
by using the contact list in his cell phone that you took,

222
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,783
were trying to look for the third skinny robber.

223
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:05,183
The three people you kept trying to call

224
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:07,783
all had women's names.

225
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:11,183
The fact that you knew there was a woman among the robbers back then

226
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:14,183
means that you were at the crime scene that day.

227
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,775
You probably figured it out

228
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:20,383
by watching their gestures and physiques at close range.

229
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,383
It hasn't been disclosed to the mass media yet

230
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,785
that there was a woman among the bank robbers, you see.

231
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,283
Since you were at the site, I'm sure you realized too.

232
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:34,783
That when Kenya said, "Okay, don't!"

233
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:40,583
He was actually saying, "Oh, Kei, don't!"

234
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:42,801
Yes.

235
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:46,583
Kenya realized that his friend Mr. Kei Kashizuka

236
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,283
was among the robbers, and tried to stop him.

237
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,883
But was silenced by Kei instead.

238
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:53,983
When I checked that cell phone a while ago,

239
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:57,383
I found Kenya's home phone number listed too,

240
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:59,983
so it's no mistake that the two were friends.

241
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,883
Since Kenya was a teller,

242
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,983
he may have leaked information to Kei

243
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:08,483
that 200 million yen was going to be brought in on that day at that time

244
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,583
when he was under the influence of alcohol or something.

245
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,783
And I guess that was used to carry out the bank robbery.

246
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:20,283
I called Kenya's parental home and asked them,

247
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:24,583
"Does Kenya's girlfriend still happen to be there?"

248
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,883
Then I was told that.

249
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:28,483
If the person I'm talking about it Serina Urakawa,

250
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:33,283
she hasn't even attended the funeral last night.

251
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:36,855
Hold it! How do you know I'm his girlfriend?

252
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,483
I told you I was his younger sister.

253
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,859
The fact that you were at the site of the robbery,

254
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,183
it's highly probable that you're also a bank clerk.

255
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,783
In order to prevent unlawful acts,

256
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:50,183
it's impossible for relatives to work at the same bank.

257
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:52,183
That's how I found out the truth

258
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,583
that you are Mr. Kenya Urakawa's girlfriend,

259
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,883
who's trying to find the three in order to avenge his death.

260
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,583
Hey...

261
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,883
Isn't this the scheme plan of the bank robbery

262
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:17,183
that occurred the other day?

263
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:21,683
They even audaciously have a picture of the three holding guns too.

264
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:24,183
No. Isn't the man in the middle the one

265
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,683
who committed suicide at the detective agency?

266
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:30,183
The man at the extreme right is the one who was found in the suitcase!

267
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,911
Then, could the woman on the extreme left

268
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,483
be the other bank robber?

269
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:39,983
It seems that the men were exchanging mails with that woman.

270
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:40,919
Yeah.

271
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,583
Using an outrageous title like, "Is the gun ready?"

272
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,983
The woman sent mail saying she's moving.

273
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,583
The address is written.

274
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,931
Let's go over.

275
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,683
Yeah.

276
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:56,935
Well, I found out right away that the Serina Urakawa

277
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:01,683
was a bank clerk when I checked the wallet.

278
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:05,383
Each time a bank clerk is transferred to another branch,

279
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:06,945
they are told to open a new bank account

280
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,947
which requires no service charge at the new branch

281
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:12,283
that they are transferred to.

282
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:14,953
From here, it's just my imagination.

283
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,083
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

284
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,383
you checked the address of Kei

285
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:26,183
using Kenya's address book and went to visit him, right?

286
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:29,483
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

287
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:32,971
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in, and you were greeted at the door

288
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:35,783
by a small framed man who was living with him.

289
00:16:35,783 --> 00:16:38,183
Unluckily, you found his gun,

290
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:41,683
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

291
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,483
he attacked you in order to silence you,

292
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:48,483
but was beaten to death by you instead.

293
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:52,991
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return,

294
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:54,783
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

295
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,383
being made in the living room,

296
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,997
so afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

297
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,483
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

298
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:04,383
and set up wiretaps.

299
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,583
Doing so, you figured that the smell from the corpse

300
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,683
would be discovered and the other accomplice would be called over too.

301
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:14,283
You didn't go to Kenya's funeral

302
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,983
because after setting up the wiretaps,

303
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:18,383
you were listening to them right through

304
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:21,783
from your car that was in the parking lot, right?

305
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:25,023
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

306
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,583
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

307
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:31,029
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

308
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,031
So he called the other robber and suggested

309
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,683
that they take the rest of the money and split.

310
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,883
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

311
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:42,683
he didn't know where the locker was.

312
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:46,283
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

313
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,083
So, Kei Kashizuka

314
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,383
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

315
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,383
look for the locker.

316
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:58,483
Of course he said nothing of the contents of the locker.

317
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,583
You, who were listening to the telephone conversation

318
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,983
between the robbers over the wiretap panicked.

319
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,083
If Detective Kogoro Mouri finds out

320
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:10,083
that Kei Kashizuka is the bank robber and is arrested,

321
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,583
you would lose the chance to take revenge.

322
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,383
That's why you ambushed Kei Kashizuka at the detective agency

323
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:20,083
and tried to ask about the other accomplice.

324
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,183
Am I more or less correct?

325
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,783
Yes, that's right.

326
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:29,087
I thought if I checked the call history on this cell phone,

327
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:33,091
I could find out who that man talked to last night,

328
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:37,583
but he was cautious and had erased all the call history.

329
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,183
If so, then we've got no choice

330
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,101
but to visit the three women that you were making calls to.

331
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,103
First, I guess we start from the nearest place.

332
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,583
Ms. Rinko Toyokita's apartment.

333
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,883
Maybe the woman who kidnapped Conan,

334
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:54,183
in order to avenge Mr. Shono's death

335
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:57,115
headed over to that woman's place?

336
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,683
Yeah.

337
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:12,183
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

338
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,183
Yeah.

339
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:17,135
What is it? What a nuisance.

340
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,583
We moved to this apartment today.

341
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,383
Right, Mom?

342
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:25,683
This isn't much.

343
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,145
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

344
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,683
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

345
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:32,683
and is normally asleep at this time,

346
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,153
so please be careful next time.

347
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,183
Oh, wait.

348
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:38,183
Something smells good.

349
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:39,783
-It's omlette! -Hey.

350
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,983
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

351
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:43,983
Don't you ever come here again!

352
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:49,883
They've started moving.

353
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:53,183
Judging from the speed, it seems like they're in the car again.

354
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,783
They're headed in the direction of Haido-cho now.

355
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:59,883
But, I wonder why they got off the car?

356
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,383
I wonder if the culprit took Conan out of the car

357
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:04,983
and took him around somewhere?

358
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:10,483
No. Maybe Conan is the one taking the culprit around.

359
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:16,183
I wonder if no one's home?

360
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:17,183
Oh, my.

361
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,883
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

362
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:24,383
Look at all the brand name packages.

363
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:27,205
Uh. We've come to say hello since we moved here.

364
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,883
Oh, is that right?

365
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:31,209
But, you don't have to do that

366
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,183
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

367
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,583
Why?

368
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,983
I won the lottery.

369
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,583
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

370
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,483
Oh, that's right.

371
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,783
I hate to trouble you, but will you go throw this away for me?

372
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,227
But, it seems that in this area,

373
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,583
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

374
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,083
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

375
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,783
Thanks for your help.

376
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:00,883
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

377
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:05,683
Oh, no. I got mail from Conan.

378
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:09,983
"I'm fine, so don't worry", he says.

379
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:13,683
It seems that he went along on his own initiative.

380
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,683
That brat.

381
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:17,783
Acting like a detective again.

382
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:20,183
Well, the curiosity of a child

383
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:24,683
and the inquisitive mind of a detective are quite common.

384
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:34,583
Yes, who is it?

385
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,883
We just moved here today,

386
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,483
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

387
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,283
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:43,281
I don't accept things like that.

389
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:46,383
Hey, what do you do?

390
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,783
I'm a writer.

391
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:50,883
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

392
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:55,083
All she eats are beef bowls.

393
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,483
Oh, right.

394
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,783
Will you do me a favor?

395
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:03,583
Could it be that... You want us to take the trash out for you?

396
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,883
This is all of it.

397
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:10,983
Did you figure anything out?

398
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:13,311
Hey...

399
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,983
So, how about it?

400
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:41,083
Did you figure out who the robber is?

401
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,883
Yep, of course.

402
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,403
But, I can't tell you who it is.

403
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,405
What do you mean?

404
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,683
Why not?

405
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:53,411
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

406
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,983
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

407
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,082
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:06,132
"Left-handed"

409
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:08,074
A long deduction requires a bit of effort.

410
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:09,427
I'm ready to take anything on anytime.

411
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,840
We're counting on you.
