1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:06,406
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,706
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:12,906
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:15,406
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,906
They take a family picture

6
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:21,406
with the owner of the mansion not present.

7
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:24,306
But in the picture, they see the eerie image of the owner

8
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:25,706
who was not there.

9
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,106
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:31,506
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,206
A new turn for the growing mystery.

12
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,306
The bottomless Dracula case.

13
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:36,806
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,906
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,306
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:28,127
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Two)"

17
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,501
Hey, what's this?

18
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,001
It looks like a psychic picture?

19
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,901
Why is Hakuya who wasn't here back then

20
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:36,901
right here in the center of the picture?

21
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,137
Beats me.

22
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,501
I have no idea why either.

23
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,101
Don't tell me that you schemed a trick or something

24
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,601
when you developed it?

25
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,301
Idiot! How do you think I can use tricks like this

26
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,701
with an analogue film in such a short time?

27
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,201
Then, are you saying that

28
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,701
Hakuya turned into a vampire just like rumor has it?

29
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,101
Don't be ridiculous!

30
00:02:55,101 --> 00:03:00,159
Vampires only exist in horror movies and novels!

31
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,901
The fact that he vanished from the coffin

32
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,701
as well as that psychic picture

33
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,165
are all something that Hakuya made up!

34
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,701
I don't think so.

35
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,169
Because he's in the picture in the position

36
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:12,171
that Kazuha and Ran had said he was.

37
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,173
I think it's for sure that

38
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:16,501
they saw the owner in that position back then.

39
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:17,901
What?

40
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:21,001
At any rate, I think it's best to find the owner

41
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,181
as soon as possible

42
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,701
and have him explain what's going on.

43
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:28,187
Yeah.

44
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,401
True.

45
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:32,501
Oh, will you please lend that picture to me?

46
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,701
We'll go check with Ran and Kazuha who are in the kitchen

47
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:39,101
whether that's really what they saw.

48
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,301
But they're both not here.

49
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:46,205
The other chefs are gone too.

50
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:50,701
I think they're eating their meals in another room at this time.

51
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:56,501
We maids actually eat with them too but...

52
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,201
We missed eating since we were looking for the owner.

53
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,901
If I remember correctly, you said

54
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:04,801
you were brought here with the fiance of the owner, right?

55
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,225
Oh, yes.

56
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,501
How'd your mother pass away?

57
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,301
I heard it was from an unfortunate accident.

58
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:14,233
Back then I was sickly and hospitalized

59
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:18,237
in the owner's hospital so I don't know the details.

60
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,901
You mean the owner ran a hospital?

61
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:25,901
Yes. He was the head of the Torakura General Hospital.

62
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,601
He was a very kind man

63
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,301
and paid for all my hospital and surgery fees.

64
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:37,601
Which means you're working as a maid here for the owner?

65
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:38,701
Right!

66
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,259
I'm taking care of the owner

67
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,001
who my mother was supposed to get married to.

68
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,501
Well, actually, six months ago,

69
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,701
I was contacted by the owner saying that

70
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,901
they got an opening for a maid so why don't I come.

71
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,271
All I did was accept his offer, you see.

72
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,901
Oh.

73
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,701
That's why I'm still not used to this mansion.

74
00:04:56,701 --> 00:05:00,001
The owner told me to come this morning too

75
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,281
but I didn't know which room to go to.

76
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,301
So, I ended up standing him up.

77
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,801
Then, I guess the owner will scold you when he's found.

78
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:09,701
I'll be fine!

79
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,901
I never got scolded after coming here.

80
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,901
The others are complaining that he's really strict about

81
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,501
the way the place is cleaned and stuff, though.

82
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,299
I don't think so.

83
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,101
Look at this floor.

84
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:26,301
There's something powdery sprinkled all over.

85
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:31,001
Those kids probably did it.

86
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,301
I told them that I had no dough to make wrappers for pot sticks,

87
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,901
then they told me that they'd make it themselves

88
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,801
and were asking me where the flour was.

89
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:40,319
I'll bet they were rushing and spilled it.

90
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,701
The dough for the wrappers are covered with Saran wrap

91
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,323
and left there, see?

92
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,101
Pot sticks equal garlic, so...

93
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,901
But, I wonder what this thick space is?

94
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:50,901
Huh?

95
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:55,501
See? Flour is gone for about a width of 50cm.

96
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,901
Like something was dragged along.

97
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,801
Now that you mentioned it.

98
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:01,601
I told them that the bag of garlic

99
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:06,101
that I bought some time ago may be in the storeroom.

100
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,301
If they dragged that bag inside here,

101
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:13,101
then those girls should be here.

102
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,601
I found it, Ran!! It's garlic!

103
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,001
Wow, that plenty!

104
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,359
No good...

105
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:23,001
It's got roots and shoots sprouting out of it.

106
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,363
No problem!

107
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:25,601
It won't taste as good,

108
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:28,367
but if we remove them, it'll be edible!

109
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,401
More than that, I wonder if just garlic will do the job?

110
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,501
We've got this too, so I assure you.

111
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,701
A cross?

112
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,501
Right! It's formidable

113
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,379
because I made it using a silver knife and spoon!

114
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,701
Don't they say these things don't work

115
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,201
unless you're a firm believer of Christianity?

116
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,701
Don't worry! You celebrate Christmas too, don't you, Ran?

117
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:52,101
You're celebrating Christ's birthday every year,

118
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,701
so of course it'll work!

119
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,901
Yep.

120
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,901
I guess so.

121
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,401
What? Blood type AB?

122
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,101
Are you saying that the blood on the coffin

123
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,301
was really blood type AB?

124
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,801
Yeah.

125
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,201
Thanks to Mr. Mouri's help,

126
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:11,301
we got the Gunma Prefectural Police Department to check it.

127
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,201
We were told it was with no doubt blood type AB.

128
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,701
But, when we asked the people here in this mansion

129
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,001
the blood type of the owner...

130
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,301
He's blood type A.

131
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:25,501
When the owner was still young, and was badly wounded.

132
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:31,601
I remember that they used the blood of all of who were blood type A.

133
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,001
Then, who's blood is that supposed to be, anyway?

134
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,701
I think that the only person with type AB blood

135
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,501
that is involved with this mansion

136
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:41,601
was the maid Ms. Shimizu who died six months ago.

137
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,301
What?

138
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:46,101
Why's the blood of a person who died six months ago

139
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,447
on that coffin?

140
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:52,901
Don't tell me that Hakuya had been saving her blood

141
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,801
and sipping in the coffin.

142
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,201
More than that, I think that

143
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,459
you should check that blood a bit more carefully.

144
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,801
Like for DNA.

145
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,801
And? How much more time will it take for the tunnel

146
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,001
to be repaired?

147
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,201
Oh, they say they'd like to have it back to normal by morning.

148
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,101
If anything happens to my daughter during that time,

149
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:13,101
you're going to get it!

150
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,801
Don't worry about that, rest assured!

151
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:19,401
Those two are into making pot sticks.

152
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:22,001
Uh, was the owner found?

153
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,201
No.

154
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:26,485
We've looked all over for him till there's nowhere else to look.

155
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,501
Did Asanobu say anything about it?

156
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:33,101
He says he tried calling Hakuya many times,

157
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:35,601
but all he gets is the answer phone.

158
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,201
And? Where is he now?

159
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,901
I guess he's taking a puff in the smoking room.

160
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:44,901
Maybe Hakuya left his cell phone somewhere.

161
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:51,101
What?

162
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,901
I got mail.

163
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,513
It's from Hakuya.

164
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,201
It says I'm going to give you my answer from now,

165
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,301
so gather in the dining room.

166
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:04,001
Which means that he sent this mail to all of us at the same time?

167
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,801
Mailed at once?

168
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:16,801
The owner hasn't shown up yet, after all.

169
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,537
It looks like it's going to rain.

170
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:23,501
Uh, aren't you worried?

171
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:26,545
Kamiyo hasn't been found yet, has she?

172
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
Honey's capricious,

173
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,501
and goes off just like that whenever she feels like it.

174
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,001
You've got to have a strong grip on her.

175
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:36,301
You're lucky to have gotten hold of someone so rich, you know.

176
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,201
Well, if she gets sick of me,

177
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,559
I'll just get back together with you my ex.

178
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:44,201
How long's Asanobu planning to smoke?

179
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,001
Don't tell me that

180
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,001
maybe he didn't receive Hakuya's mail

181
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,801
because he changed his cell phone.

182
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,601
What?

183
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,575
I just saw a strange shadow on the window.

184
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,901
A strange shadow?

185
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:07,301
Don't tell me that Hakuya really...

186
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,401
Turned into a vampire...

187
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,901
That's not possible.

188
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,301
I'm sure he just used a rope or something.

189
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:17,401
To hang himself upside down. I'm telling you!

190
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:21,901
No joke?

191
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,901
He disappeared above.

192
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,601
It can't be. That's not humanly possible!

193
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,901
Hey, look at that.

194
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,701
Hey, Hattori.

195
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,301
What's that?

196
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,801
Is... isn't it a bird?

197
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:46,625
But isn't it too large to be a bird?

198
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,301
Kudo? You're bleeding!

199
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,701
Don't tell me it bit you?

200
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,201
Just what're you talking about?

201
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,401
I just got a bit wet in the rain.

202
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,401
It's not rain.

203
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,639
Blood's dripping from the roof!

204
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,301
Above here! Is there are room?

205
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,643
Yes.

206
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,645
The smoking room's in the attic.

207
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,101
What about the smoking room?

208
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,201
Blood's probably dripping from there!

209
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,201
No way...

210
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:14,653
If I remember correctly, Asanobu's there.

211
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:25,701
No good.

212
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:29,601
His carotid artery's been cut and his already dead.

213
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:33,201
He's holding the knife.

214
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,673
Which means...

215
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:39,801
Somebody tried to attack him so he killed himself.

216
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,201
Or...

217
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,701
That somebody wanted to make it look that way.

218
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,401
It's one or the other.

219
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:57,203
Dear?

220
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:01,303
God, I'd better hurry and find honey fast too, or else...

221
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:06,705
True, maybe Kamiyo's already been taken away

222
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,803
by Hakuya who's turned into a vampire

223
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:13,003
as legend has it and is being impaled.

224
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,713
Hey.

225
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,503
Excuse me.

226
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,403
Won't you please tell us about it?

227
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,303
About that legend!

228
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:25,703
It was around the Edo Era.

229
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,703
When the, feudal lord, ancestor of the Torakura family

230
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,903
used to rule this area.

231
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:35,403
Rumor started going around that blessed with no children,

232
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:38,737
he would have to give his inheritance over to his younger brother.

233
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,503
Then suddenly, he invited

234
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:44,103
a beautiful woman as his mistress to the castle.

235
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:46,745
After a while, she happily ended up

236
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:50,003
giving birth to an heir, however...

237
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,503
One stormy night, an incident occurred.

238
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,803
An incident?

239
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:56,503
That woman seems to have fallen off the cliff,

240
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:59,303
and was found dead with a branch

241
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:01,703
pierced through her chest.

242
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:04,103
The lord who was suspicious,

243
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,765
tortured the people who were close to the mistress

244
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,769
with torture devices he asked to be sent from the Western world.

245
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,803
Then, the truth came to light.

246
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:16,003
The mistress seems to have been told by her brother-in-law

247
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,777
that the young inheritor had gone to the forest and not returned,

248
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:22,781
in order to lure her into the forest.

249
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:26,503
The lord who was angered is said to have impaled

250
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,787
his younger brother as well as all those who helped him

251
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,789
in the same way as his mistress was found.

252
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:34,793
And lined them up in the forest.

253
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:40,003
Since then, this lord became better known as "Lord Impaler".

254
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:45,803
Oh. But it's not like he was a vampire or anything, right?

255
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:47,603
Don't you know?

256
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:50,103
About Vlad III of Wallachia, who Dracula was modeled

257
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:55,603
after that impaled traitors and rebels one after the other

258
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,703
was called "Lord Impaler."

259
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,703
Oh, really?

260
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:02,821
Yeah. The father of Vlad III was Lord Dragon.

261
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,823
Therefore, he was called Dracul.

262
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,825
It seems that he called himself Dracula

263
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,103
because he was that Lord's son.

264
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:10,403
While we're at it,

265
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:13,803
would you like to take a look at the European room?

266
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,903
European room?

267
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:20,203
I see.

268
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:23,403
So, the torture devices that the Lord had bought

269
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,303
and sent over from Europe are stored here, eh?

270
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,847
A guillotine's here too.

271
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,303
I see! It was this room!

272
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,303
Huh?

273
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:35,203
See, the owner called me this morning.

274
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:38,603
But I didn't know where this European room was.

275
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:40,859
You could've just asked somebody, right?

276
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,303
But, he told me to come to the European room

277
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:45,903
without telling anyone.

278
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:51,503
He cautioned me not to tell the butler in particular.

279
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,603
I guess when you were searching for the owner,

280
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,503
you looked in this room too?

281
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:58,603
Oh.

282
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:02,003
I passed, because it gives me the creeps.

283
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:08,303
Lord Impaler, this torture room and that flying monster.

284
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:11,503
I could never tell Ran and Kazuha about it.

285
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:14,503
Done! The pot sticks are ready.

286
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,895
We've made a lot!

287
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,903
All we need to do now is cook them.

288
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,899
We've got to let Conan and Heiji taste them too.

289
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:22,403
Right!

290
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:27,903
Oh, well...

291
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:32,911
I just came to tell you to be careful when you use the stove.

292
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,803
-Oh. Yes, sir. -Okay!

293
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,403
Okay, I'll leave it to you girls, then.

294
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,003
Don't you have to tell them?

295
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,303
That there's been a murder.

296
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:45,303
Ignorance is bliss for the two girls.

297
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:46,503
True.

298
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:50,929
Listen, everybody!

299
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,703
All of you four make sure that

300
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:56,003
you don't leave this dining room until I return!

301
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:58,303
But, I've got to look for honey.

302
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:01,803
The butler and I will go look for her.

303
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:04,703
Call me if something comes up, okay, Hikaru?

304
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:06,203
Yep.

305
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:10,949
I hope you told all the other maids and chefs

306
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,951
to stay in their rooms?

307
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,955
Yes. But, you dealing with a vampire.

308
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,959
Is it really okay just us, doing this on our own?

309
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,963
Idiot. There're no such things as vampires in this world!

310
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:28,303
We're going to search for evidence to prove so from now!

311
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:32,703
First of all, let's check this coffin.

312
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:36,003
I'll bet it's rigged in some way.

313
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,903
Besides, this room.

314
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:41,503
It somehow seems different from when we first came, no?

315
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:46,703
But, the carpet, desk and the sofa are all in place.

316
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:47,903
Right.

317
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:51,703
Talking of coffins during the incident that happened six months ago,

318
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:54,993
it seems the master asked the chef to wake him up.

319
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:57,703
It's only right to ask a maid or butler

320
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,603
to do something like that, isn't it?

321
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:03,603
In my case, I think it's because I wasn't trusted.

322
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:07,303
Because each time I tried to stop the owner from his weird actions,

323
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:10,203
he used to give me an unpleasant, suspicious look.

324
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,503
Hey! Look at this!

325
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:15,013
There are two slits in the carpet.

326
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,003
Which means if I pull here

327
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:21,603
and remove just this width

328
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:24,203
and join the remaining parts together...

329
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,403
The carpet will get small!

330
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,903
What?

331
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:29,303
In other words!

332
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,703
The position that the coffin was in when we first saw it

333
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:34,003
was more towards the center of the room.

334
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,303
Huh?

335
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,035
A handle on the tile.

336
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:44,303
I see. So, this is how it was rigged.

337
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,203
And, next.

338
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,703
For that psychic picture.

339
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,803
I more or less have an idea.

340
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:54,803
Just as I thought.

341
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:58,703
Hey. Did you always take pictures facing your back to the wall?

342
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,903
Yes. The chairs were also placed in that position.

343
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:07,065
Only this time it seems that the two girls pushed the shutter.

344
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:13,071
But the fact is that the owner had asked the maid Hikaru to do it.

345
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,403
-Huh? -Why?

346
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:16,403
I wonder.

347
00:18:16,403 --> 00:18:19,503
Ms. Shimizu, who passed away six months ago,

348
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,103
used to do it before.

349
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,703
I thought he just figured that

350
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:28,103
it was her duty to take after that role.

351
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:32,503
Well, that maid seems to have been favored by the owner.

352
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:33,503
Huh?

353
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:35,403
Hikaru told us!

354
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:37,403
That the owner was very kind to her

355
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:39,097
and that she never was scolded.

356
00:18:39,303 --> 00:18:41,603
What a thing to say!

357
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:47,103
All he used to do recently was talk ill of her.

358
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:51,109
But, she was invited to come to this mansion by him, wasn't she?

359
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,603
No way!

360
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:54,403
The owner told me that she used her status

361
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,003
as the daughter of his former fiance

362
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:59,603
and begged in tears for him to hire her.

363
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:03,703
Well, since she's a quite cheerful girl,

364
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:07,703
the maids and chefs seem to take well to her.

365
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:12,703
Maybe she came to this mansion pursuing something, after all.

366
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:14,103
Pursuing something?

367
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:18,903
Have you heard about her mother Yoko from her?

368
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:22,203
Yeah, that she died of an unfortunate accident.

369
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,903
She died on a stormy night.

370
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,703
Yoko suddenly said that

371
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:30,803
she was going to go to the owner's hospital by car.

372
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,151
I stopped her saying that it was dangerous but...

373
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:36,003
just as I had worried, she fell over the cliff car and all

374
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:39,157
while driving along the mountain road.

375
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:43,161
The police said that it was a driving accident but...

376
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,603
But, why did she go out on a day like that?

377
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:49,603
Just before she left, I got a call from the owner

378
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:55,173
to relay to Yoko that her daughter's surgery went well.

379
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:59,177
That's why the maid, Ms. Shimizu was saying that

380
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:03,903
she probably wanted to see her as soon as she possibly could.

381
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:09,187
Yoko back then looked pale, and didn't look to me that way at all.

382
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,203
Why did Ms. Shimizu say something like that?

383
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:14,803
Because I told her to relay the message

384
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:17,503
that I got from the owner to Yoko.

385
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:20,903
Was the car Yoko's?

386
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:25,803
No. It was Asanobu's, who died a while ago.

387
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:29,703
Everyone was here at this mansion back then.

388
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:32,603
Everyone? Which means the others were here too?

389
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,403
Yes.

390
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:39,217
Everyone who is here today, were all here.

391
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,703
So if that accident

392
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:45,223
were to have been schemed by someone as rumor has it...

393
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,003
Does Hikaru know of this?

394
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:49,227
I wonder.

395
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:53,231
The owner told me not to say anything.

396
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,503
Because he would tell her himself.

397
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:58,303
Huh?

398
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:01,239
Hikaru was summoned by the owner this morning

399
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,241
but said she didn't get to see him.

400
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,303
If that was a lie and in fact she did get to see him...

401
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:09,903
Where's Hikaru?

402
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:11,249
She's gone!

403
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,403
She said she was going to serve tea.

404
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,203
And went to the kitchen.

405
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,255
To the kitchen?

406
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,703
By the way, aren't the police here yet?

407
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,259
You did call them, right?

408
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:26,303
Yes, but they said the tunnel would take until morning to fix.

409
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:28,703
Did you find my honey yet?

410
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,403
Not yet.

411
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,271
I'm getting a bit hungry too.

412
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:35,273
Maybe I'll go take a bite of the pot sticks

413
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,603
that those two girls made.

414
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,803
How do you know that Ran and Kazuha

415
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,279
are making the pot sticks?

416
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,703
They came here a while ago.

417
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,603
To borrow the key to the freezer from Hikaru.

418
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,203
They said they made too many

419
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,303
so that they wanted to freeze some.

420
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:53,903
Come to think of it, after they came to borrow the key,

421
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:56,703
Hikaru also went to the kitchen.

422
00:21:56,703 --> 00:21:59,297
Right, there's still one place left.

423
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:01,703
That we haven't searched.

424
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,301
The freezer.

425
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:04,903
Don't tell me that inside the freezer.

426
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:10,903
No good. This isn't the right key either.

427
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:15,303
I wish they'd put labels showing which key is for what.

428
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,703
Well, we'll get to it in time.

429
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,003
True.

430
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,580
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,440
"Stake"

432
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,660
This case looks pretty bad.

433
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,400
Yeah, it sucks... blood!
