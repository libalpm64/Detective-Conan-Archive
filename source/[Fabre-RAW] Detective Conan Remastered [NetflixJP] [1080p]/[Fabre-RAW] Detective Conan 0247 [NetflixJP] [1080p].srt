1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,690
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,990
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,990
A tangled net murder case on the beach.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,090
The two girls also come to terms with each other today.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,590
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,390
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,890
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,200
We came to visit the ocean of Izu once again.

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,500
Ran and the others got acquainted with Yuuta Yoshizawa,

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Noboru Shimojo, and Giichi Yoshizawa at the beach,

11
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,700
but there was a somewhat scowl and dark atmosphere.

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,900
That night, we coincidentally ran into

13
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,100
Mr. Shimojo and Mr. Yoshizawa

14
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,700
and their friend, Nobutsugu Nezu.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,400
The three seem to have been waiting for Mr. Aramaki.

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,800
But, at that time, Mr. Aramaki was ruthlessly being washed up to shore,

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,100
a sorry sight and dead.

18
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,200
"The Mystery Caught In the Net (Part 2)"

19
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,650
Everybody sure is late.

20
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,250
Okay, I got it.

21
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,750
Keep at it.

22
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,650
-Yes, sir. -Officer Yokomizo.

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,150
I've figured it out.

24
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,850
What did you figure out?

25
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,350
The trick the killer used to drown that man.

26
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,350
What?

27
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,450
What's your reaction supposed to mean?

28
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,650
And how did the killer do it?

29
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,650
That boat that was drifting is a fake.

30
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,750
The real trick is very simple and clear.

31
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,650
The killer got the man wasted,

32
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,150
wrapped him up in a net then threw him out on the beach.

33
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,850
High tide comes and the man is rendered helpless,

34
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,650
not being able to move, and drowning.

35
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,450
So the killer didn't have to be at the scene of the crime to do it.

36
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,750
Sonoko, you're a genius.

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,750
I am, aren't I?

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,750
I don't mean to be a wet blanket,

39
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,250
but that's impossible.

40
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,250
Because even at high tide,

41
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,150
water can only increase several centimeters at a time,

42
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,650
and not all at once instantaneously.

43
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,350
If the waves touch the body and the water gradually increases,

44
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,350
no matter what the case, the victim would've awakened.

45
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,650
Besides the victim was only tangled in the net

46
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,950
and not tied up or anything.

47
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,550
He could've gotten up and avoided the waves.

48
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,750
He could've escaped on all fours

49
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,550
to a place out of range from the waves.

50
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,250
But, it would be a different story of course

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,950
if he were given some strong sleeping pill or something.

52
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,050
We haven't got any such report from the coroner yet, though.

53
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,550
What then, what about this?

54
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,350
The killer was holding him down with the net

55
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,350
covered over the man until he drowned.

56
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,950
How about it?

57
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,250
There's no trick involved there.

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,950
-No good either. -Sonoko.

59
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,050
I see, that's what happened.

60
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,350
That's why that person did something so weird.

61
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,750
No doubt about it.

62
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,150
That person's the killer.

63
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,850
"Noboru Shimojo (34), Fisherman" -Moreover, hasn't realized yet...

64
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,550
"Nobutsugu Nezu (35)" -that the trick that he used

65
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,950
"Fisherman" -in an attempt to hide his crime

66
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,250
"Yuuta Yoshizawa (34)" -is actually working against him

67
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,250
"Fisherman" -and revealing what he did.

68
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,650
Hey, come on, that's enough.

69
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,450
Even all the onlookers have left already.

70
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,050
We said all we have to say,

71
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,350
and if there's nothing more, I'm leaving.

72
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,350
Please wait. Just a little while more.

73
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,850
-What is it? -We need you to stay here just a little while longer.

74
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,450
Sonoko, you can't think of anything

75
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,450
that has to do with the murder anymore, can you?

76
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,850
So, let's go back to the hotel.

77
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,350
I guess so.

78
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,750
Don't tell me... Is something dawning on you?

79
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,750
Like always?

80
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,050
I guess it's just a plain old mosquito bite.

81
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,550
Shinichi,

82
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,050
it seems that the investigation's not going to see much progress for now,

83
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,350
so why don't we get going too?

84
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,150
Come on, what good is it going to do is to head on back?

85
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,750
When Detective Agasa's got to start explaining the truth of the case?

86
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,850
Then, you mean, don't tell me that...

87
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,050
Yeah, I've figured the case out.

88
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,850
I know now who drowned Mr. Aramaki on this beach,

89
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,050
and the trick he used to carry it out too.

90
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,350
I'm waiting for Mitsuhiko and the others to bring me

91
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,450
the tools necessary to explain what happened,

92
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,050
so when they come back move your lips like always

93
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,550
and match it to my voice through the voice changer...

94
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,950
It's not here.

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,450
Oh no, I forgot the voice changer in the hotel room.

96
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,450
Hey, hey.

97
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,650
Here you are.

98
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,850
Ai.

99
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,950
Just as I thought.

100
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,050
Thank you.

101
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,950
It's amazing how you figured out we were here.

102
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,150
You were taking so long to come back,

103
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,150
so I asked the person at the hotel

104
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,850
whether there was a murder or something that happened near the beach.

105
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,550
I'm so sorry, you completely slipped my mind.

106
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,750
Where is everybody else?

107
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,150
They're...

108
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,950
Hey!

109
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,150
Conan.

110
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,750
We found it.

111
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,450
Here, a large shell.

112
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,750
A dead starfish.

113
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,850
Here. I asked the people living in the neighborhood

114
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,650
to lend me a basin and bucket.

115
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,350
What are you going to use all this for?

116
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,550
Just wait and see.

117
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
Please give me a break, will you, officer?

118
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,650
Just when are we going to get to leave anyway?

119
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,450
Like I said, just a little while more

120
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,650
until Mr. Aramaki's estimated time of death is determined.

121
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,350
Gosh. Just how long is it going to take?

122
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,750
It doesn't take this long to wait

123
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,950
for things like this in detective dramas on TV.

124
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,950
Besides, isn't it impossible for us to have killed him?

125
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,250
When we called his cell phone at 8:40 pm,

126
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,450
someone answered and hung up right away.

127
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,150
You've got the call received record for that call,

128
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,550
and all three of us were at the Chinese restaurant of that hotel

129
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,450
at that time anyway.

130
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,450
If you insist on suspecting us,

131
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,050
give us an explanation, will you?

132
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,050
How on earth was the phone that was tangled up in the net together

133
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,350
with Aramaki taken from such a distance?

134
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,050
That's...

135
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,950
It's the waves.

136
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,350
See, look.

137
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,850
That empty can...

138
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,750
is just like Mr. Aramaki who was washed up to shore, isn't it?

139
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,050
Mr. Aramaki was washed up to shore.

140
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,150
I see, he rolled.

141
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,150
Mr. Aramaki who was washed up to shore

142
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,250
rolled on the beach pushed by the waves.

143
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,650
That's so obvious.

144
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,600
So what about it?

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,900
Mr. Aramaki rolled along

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,400
and the switch of the cell phone that was caught in the same net

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,700
was pushed by a shell or something that was also in the net.

148
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,200
With the next roll or something,

149
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,900
the switch was pushed again and the phone was disconnected.

150
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,400
As proof of that the cell phone that was found together

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
with Mr. Aramaki was full of scratches.

152
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
The same went for his clothes and body.

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
No doubt about it.

154
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,400
The phone connected when you called him Mr. Nezu

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,000
was not because someone pushed the button,

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
but because when Mr. Aramaki rolled around,

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,300
the button of the cell phone just happened to be pushed.

158
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,700
In other words, if the killer could predict

159
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,900
that the body would roll on the beach,

160
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,800
the killer didn't have to be here to connect and disconnect the phone.

161
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,100
But, wasn't that just a coincidence?

162
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Maybe the body rolling on the beach could've been predicted,

163
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,900
but how could the button of the cell be pushed

164
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,100
at exactly the same time that Nobutsugu happened to call him?

165
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,900
Wouldn't that have been impossible?

166
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,300
I guess so.

167
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,900
But, your alibi that was based on the phone call is no good now.

168
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,700
If so, why don't you tell them to hurry up

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,000
and check on the estimated time of death?

170
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Hello.

171
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,100
What? You've got the victim's estimated time of death?

172
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,900
Okay, great.

173
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,000
Well?

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,500
Well, you see...

175
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Hey. Cut out the whispering,

176
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
but hurry and tell us.

177
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,100
You know now what time Aramaki died, don't you?

178
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,900
Yes, now we know.

179
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,600
According to Mr. Aramaki's estimated time of death,

180
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,500
the alibis of all three of you are voided.

181
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,600
That is, all three of you remain suspects.

182
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
-What? -What did you say?

183
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Then, when did he die?

184
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,600
If you don't tell us what you know,

185
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
how can we be convinced?

186
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,100
I got to the Chinese restaurant after 7:00 pm?

187
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,900
Yuuta got there at 8:00 pm sharp.

188
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,200
And, Nobutsugu got there at 8:40 pm.

189
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
It takes 10 minutes from here to the restaurant.

190
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,700
Nobutsugu visited his father's grave

191
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,400
before coming to the restaurant

192
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,000
so I'm sure that somebody from the temple saw him.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Come on. Tell us.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
What time did that guy die?

195
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
If that time was when we couldn't be here,

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
-we couldn't have committed the crime... -Not really...

197
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,000
It can be done without being here...

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
if this trick is used.

199
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,060
Trick? Mr. Agasa.

200
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,260
Just what are you doing?

201
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,960
Preparing to explain the trick

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,160
as I'm sure you all realize already.

203
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
The sand that is...

204
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,060
The sand in this basin is of course the sand of this beach.

205
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,860
This starfish is the victim, Mr. Aramaki.

206
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,460
And the water in this bucket is the water at high tide.

207
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Okay, back down everyone.

208
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,960
-Okay. -Okay.

209
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,960
First a hole is made in the sand.

210
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,260
One just big enough

211
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,460
so that the body of a person lying down would fit inside.

212
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,060
Then, Mr. Aramaki who is drunk,

213
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,360
wasted and asleep is placed into that hole

214
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,060
with a net wrapped around him.

215
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Dr. Agasa.

216
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,360
Too bad, but that won't work.

217
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,460
You want to explain that the body is wrapped in the net

218
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,960
so it cannot pull free, then you wait for high tide

219
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,860
and wait for the victim to drown on his own, right?

220
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,360
But, that's impossible.

221
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,160
Because Officer Yokomizo just finished explaining

222
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,460
that even though there is a high tide,

223
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,760
there is no way that the water would suddenly increase so many centimeters,

224
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,560
so the victim would realize that he's drowning and would flee.

225
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,860
How about if I use this?

226
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,660
A shell?

227
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,760
You put and press this onto the victim,

228
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,260
then if a high tide comes...

229
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
I guess so.

230
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,860
If a person is wrapped in a net and moreover,

231
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,560
has something like that put on him,

232
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,860
he wouldn't be able to escape

233
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,960
even if he did realize that high tide was coming.

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
But, if it were so,

235
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,060
the large rock would've been found on his body when he was found.

236
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,660
Was there anything like that around?

237
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,960
No, there wasn't.

238
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,660
Right. If it were a plain rock,

239
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
it would've just been left on him, but...

240
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,560
If that weight looked something like this shell...

241
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
See what happens.

242
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,560
It floated up.

243
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,260
But, wait.

244
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,460
Where did you find such a large and convenient shell?

245
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,560
Don't tell me.

246
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,360
It's that boat?

247
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,760
Yes, the killer got Mr. Aramaki drunk.

248
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,060
After wrapping him up in the net,

249
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,560
he was placed inside the hole that was dug in the sand,

250
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,860
and this boat was placed on top of him as a weight.

251
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,860
This way, even if he did realize that water was covering him,

252
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,960
it would be impossible for him to get up and he would drown.

253
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,060
After the water level increases even more the boat floats

254
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,260
and drifts away from Mr. Aramaki.

255
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
You were waiting for that time to come

256
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,660
at the Chinese restaurant, weren't you?

257
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,460
Mr. Noboru Shimojo.

258
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,960
And, everything worked out as you planned.

259
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,660
Hey, Noboru.

260
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't tell me, you...

261
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,260
Mr. Shimojo, you...

262
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,760
Am I doing okay?

263
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,660
Yeah, you're doing great.

264
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,060
Just keep on matching your lips.

265
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,560
But, what about the liquor bottle,

266
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,360
sandals and button that were in the boat?

267
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,860
With those things in the boat,

268
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,960
it would look like Mr. Aramaki were put on board the boat, but...

269
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,260
no one would even think that he was being locked up under the boat.

270
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,160
Moreover, the sea water that accumulated at the bottom of the boat

271
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,960
made it even heavier.

272
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,260
It was all planned to make it harder for Mr. Aramaki to escape.

273
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,460
It is true that from what you said just now,

274
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,660
it is possible to commit the crime without being here.

275
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,160
But, how did you come to the conclusion that I'm the one who did it?

276
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,360
You knew the order of the incoming calls list

277
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
of Mr. Aramaki's cell phone, didn't you?

278
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,760
That your name is listed next to Mr. Yoshizawa's.

279
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,360
That's because he said that he called

280
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
before coming to the Chinese restaurant.

281
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,460
Mr. Yoshizawa came at 8:00 pm sharp.

282
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,360
You made the first phone call at 7:47 pm.

283
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,360
How did you know that Mr. Yoshizawa called Mr. Aramaki before you did?

284
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,560
So that's because...

285
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,060
You knew that Mr. Yoshizawa called Mr. Aramaki's cell phone.

286
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,060
You heard the call come in when you were setting up the boat trick

287
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,860
that I just finished explaining.

288
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,160
I see.

289
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,260
Just what are you talking about?

290
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,760
You're just making an irresponsible remark.

291
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
I mean, so you're saying that I'm the killer

292
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,960
just because I made a mistake in the order of the received calls list.

293
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,560
There's no proof that I carried out the trick

294
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,060
that you explained just now either.

295
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
It could be that somebody just got him drunk,

296
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,460
wrapped him up in a net and dropped him into the ocean. Right?

297
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,860
Right, Mr. Agasa.

298
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,060
There is no proof that Mr. Shimojo committed the murder.

299
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,560
There is no such thing.

300
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,860
What we have are all proof that are advantageous to you.

301
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,560
That's right.

302
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,760
The only evidence that you have now

303
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,060
is that I was far away in that Chinese restaurant

304
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,360
at the time the guy died.

305
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,560
Who can testify that for you?

306
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,260
Aren't you one of the witnesses for that too?

307
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,960
At what point of time are you referring to?

308
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,860
I've become a bit forgetful recently so...

309
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,160
Why do you...

310
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,460
You were there too, weren't you, old fart?

311
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,660
Right by me, at the Chinese restaurant.

312
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,960
At about 8:00 pm when he died!

313
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,360
Wait a second, Mr. Shimojo?

314
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,060
How do you know

315
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,660
that Mr. Aramaki's time of death was about 8:00 pm?

316
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,260
I heard you whispering among yourselves a while ago.

317
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
That's strange.

318
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,560
The estimated time of death that was reported to me

319
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,360
was from 6:00 pm to 9:30 pm when Mr. Aramaki was found dead.

320
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,560
Don't give me that nonsense.

321
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm sure you can get the details of his death, can't you?

322
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,660
From things like postmortem rigidity and death spots.

323
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,260
Absolutely.

324
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,860
The estimated time of death is usually assumed

325
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,060
by signs of postmortem rigidity,

326
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,760
death spots and rectal temperatures, but...

327
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
that is if the body is laid to rest

328
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,460
in one place at constant temperature.

329
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,860
However, in Mr. Aramaki's case,

330
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,960
his body was tossed about by the waves and spun around.

331
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,460
In this case,

332
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,760
the blood accumulates at the bottom of the body because of gravity,

333
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,760
and it becomes impossible to judge by death spots.

334
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,560
The muscles that become rigid are difficult to set in place.

335
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,360
Since his body was constantly covered with waves,

336
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,860
his body temperature kept changing.

337
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,960
Therefore, the speed of decrease of rectal temperature

338
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,660
did not take its normal course,

339
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,360
making it impossible to arrive at an accurate estimated time of death.

340
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,860
In other words, nobody including the police know

341
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,460
what time Mr. Aramaki died.

342
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,460
But if you are the killer that set it up

343
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,360
so that he would drown at that time, of course you would know.

344
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
Noboru.

345
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,060
Don't tell me you did it for our fathers...

346
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,260
Yeah. Thank me for it.

347
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I conjured up all the courage within me

348
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,760
to kill the punk Aramaki who killed our fathers eight years ago.

349
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,260
Eight years ago?

350
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,660
Wasn't that an accident that happened

351
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,360
because the men set out on their boat

352
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,060
despite knowing that there was a storm?

353
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
Our fathers didn't just sail out

354
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,760
because they wanted to prove how macho they were.

355
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
Aramaki ignored the report of an oncoming storm and sailed out,

356
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,160
so our fathers went out after him to call him back.

357
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,260
Aramaki lost control of the wheels because of the high waves,

358
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,760
and not only did he crash into the boat of our fathers,

359
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,660
he left our fathers who were thrown out into the sea to die

360
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,960
and went back to shore alone!

361
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I asked a timid mate that was on board his boat at that time

362
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,560
and pressed him to tell me, so there's no mistake about it.

363
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,360
Then, why didn't you take him to the police?

364
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
He disappeared out of the blue.

365
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,660
What?

366
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,060
I asked Aramaki about him, and that guy,

367
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,860
without a tinge of guilt, wise cracked...

368
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,560
Do you know how a perfect crime is committed?

369
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,360
You set sail with another person and when you're out at sea,

370
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,160
you push the other guy off the boat.

371
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,860
The body won't be found and there are no witnesses either.

372
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,060
How about it? Easy, right?

373
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,660
Which means that Aramaki killed that man too...

374
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,560
But, you didn't need to kill him, did you?

375
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Now, you're just as guilty as he is.

376
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,360
Just what do you mean by that?

377
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,460
I avenged the death of our fathers, for you guys too, you know?

378
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,160
After I sacrificed myself,

379
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,660
went out of my way to conjure up courage

380
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,460
and pass judgment on that guy all by myself, what's...

381
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,260
What right do you have talking to me like that?

382
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
No way.

383
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
Ran.

384
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,760
No way.

385
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,460
The word courage is to be used to conjure up feelings of justice...

386
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,260
It should never be used to justify taking someone's life.

387
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,660
The killer, who was rendered speechless at Ran's remark,

388
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,260
was escorted silently to the Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department.

389
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,460
He wore a calm and sad smile on his face

390
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,960
as he was being taken away.

391
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Maybe I stuck my nose in too far.

392
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,960
Nope, you did just great.

393
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,860
You really surprised me.

394
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,660
I just thought that was what Shinichi might've said.

395
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Are you in the mood for love or something?

396
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,260
No.

397
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Courage...

398
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,360
is a word to be used to conjure up

399
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
feelings of justice.

400
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,660
I'm Ai Haibara.

401
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,060
Nice to meet you.

402
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,360
Nice to meet you.

403
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,860
Let's be friends.

404
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,920
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,080
"Pottery making soil"

406
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,380
The stage for the next show will be at a pension.

407
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,380
What? There's only 10 more days of summer vacation left?

408
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:41,470
Oh, no!
