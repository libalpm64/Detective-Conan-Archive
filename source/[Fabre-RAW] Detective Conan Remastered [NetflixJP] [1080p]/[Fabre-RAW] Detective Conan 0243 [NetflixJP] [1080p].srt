1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,390
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,390
The light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,990
Today we'll meet a fake Kogoro.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,790
This sure is a tough case.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,390
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,190
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,390
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,850
"Aoiya Inn"

9
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,450
Welcome, great detective. We are honored.

10
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,750
I didn't notice at all.

11
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,050
"Yoshiro Onda (58)" -I had been told last night that

12
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,750
you will be arriving in a company of three.

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,350
I arrived early because the case was closed quicker than I expected.

14
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,350
By the way, do you have it?

15
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,950
This is the strange briefcase that I told you about.

16
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,550
Of course, I have not seen the inside for five years.

17
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,950
In fact, I couldn't because it is locked.

18
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,750
Don't worry. I think I can manage.

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,550
Excuse me.

20
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,050
Can't you open it here?

21
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,250
Don't worry.

22
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,950
I will let you know

23
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,750
as soon as the mystery is solved.

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,750
After all, I'm Kogoro Mouri.

25
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,750
"The Kogoro Mouri's Impostor (Part 1)"

26
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,450
The air is so clean, it's delicious!

27
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,450
It's lovely being in the bosom of nature.

28
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,150
Darn it. Why did we have to get off the cab

29
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,550
and walk the rest of the way?

30
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,650
Why not?

31
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,350
The inn is right out there when we get out of this forest.

32
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,750
We still have a lot of time before our appointment.

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,950
I wanted to get there to immerse myself in the spa!

34
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,050
By the way, why don't you do something about the sunglasses?

35
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,350
It makes you look suspicious!

36
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,450
Dimwit!

37
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,550
How can the great detective show up

38
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,850
with a mosquito bite on the eyelid?

39
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,350
And, there may be female admirers

40
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,050
waiting for me at the inn!

41
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,650
I don't want to look bad.

42
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,550
Pathetic.

43
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,250
Who put this rock here!

44
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,350
What's that?

45
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,750
It's a Jizo statue.

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,450
It must have fallen in some sort of an accident.

47
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,350
Let's put it upright.

48
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,250
No...

49
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,050
If you do that,

50
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,450
a curse might fall on you!

51
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,550
What?

52
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,850
It's the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

53
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,050
who barely escaped being arrested the last time.

54
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,950
Well, hold it.

55
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,050
The klutz at Gunma Police.

56
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,550
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,050
I have business at the Aoiya Inn

58
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,250
just ahead from here.

59
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,050
Could it be

60
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,650
it's about the case of the unidentified man in the red jacket?

61
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,350
Well...

62
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,150
Actually, I'm also on my way to Aoiya Inn.

63
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,950
The body was found around here, in the Kashiragami Forest.

64
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,550
Kashiragami is the name of a god who causes headaches.

65
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,150
People with worries on their mind

66
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,850
who go deep into the forest are captivated

67
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,350
by the forest and never come back.

68
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,050
This forest is famous for suicide.

69
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,350
Suicide?

70
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,150
Yes! The statue that you were about to set upright

71
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,250
was the "Forward Fallen Jizo" that appeases the spirits.

72
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,050
It is said that making it upright invites misfortune.

73
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,050
That's why it is left that way for a very long time.

74
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,050
Since we're all heading to the same place,

75
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,850
I'll take you all by car.

76
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,050
No.

77
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,450
My daughter wants to walk in the forest.

78
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,550
But your daughter is already in the car.

79
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,850
Gosh.

80
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,050
So the body that was found is an employee at Aoiya Inn?

81
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,150
Yes. The body was found

82
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,850
during a hunt for wild edible plants.

83
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,150
But, there was something wrong with the body.

84
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,550
Something wrong? What is it?

85
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,550
We found car keys

86
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,950
but no driver's license

87
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,450
We also found cigarettes

88
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,750
but we can't find any lighter or matches.

89
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,550
Besides that, the man supposedly died in the summer

90
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,450
but was wearing a sweater.

91
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,950
How do you know he died in the summer?

92
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,550
The evidence was found in the knapsack he was carrying.

93
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,550
A package of milk and a bun with product life

94
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,250
expiring exactly 4 years ago

95
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,550
on July 12.

96
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,550
This had been verified our receipt

97
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,050
from a nearby convenience store

98
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,150
where they had been purchased.

99
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,250
Both milk and the bun had been squashed

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,150
and ruined on impact when the body hit the ground.

101
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,450
Hit the ground?

102
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,150
The body had a noose on its neck,

103
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,250
and there was a broken branch nearby,

104
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,950
to which the rope was tied.

105
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,150
Most probably, the man hung himself

106
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,950
and the branch broke later.

107
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,050
That appears to make it like he had killed himself.

108
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,350
Yes. That is why I am planning to ask

109
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,150
the employee who discovered the body

110
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,350
to find the reason why he killed himself

111
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,050
so we can be sure it's a suicide.

112
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,550
Why are you going there, Mr. Mouri?

113
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,050
Well, this man in the red jacket

114
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,550
reportedly saw the owner of the inn.

115
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,950
What? When was that?

116
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,450
He said that was around October five years ago

117
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,350
I have been told that this man showed up

118
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,450
at the inn suddenly and told the owner this

119
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,850
"I will pay 100,000 yen for you

120
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,550
to keep this briefcase and the envelope."

121
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,150
He said, "I'll come back to get it one year later no matter what."

122
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,250
A briefcase and envelope?

123
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,550
Yeah. He told the owner to give him back

124
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,050
in the briefcase

125
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,450
if he personally shows up and to hand anybody else

126
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,250
who shows up the envelope.

127
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,850
Although there's no proof the man in the red jacket

128
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,950
and the body found in the woods

129
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,650
are the same person or not.

130
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,250
The man reportedly emphasized

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,550
"not to forget the red jacket and long hair"

132
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,850
so probably, it is the same man.

133
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,250
In the end, it appears he did not show up.

134
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,950
Come to think of it, the dead man had long hair.

135
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,850
So, this is what you think happened.

136
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,450
The man deposited the briefcase with the inn owner five years ago

137
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,550
and said he will return to pick it up no matter what.

138
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,850
Roughly one year later in summer,

139
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,350
he killed himself on his way to pick it up.

140
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,250
The guy's dumb.

141
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,350
You can get it if you're dead.

142
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,850
That's why I've been asked by the owner

143
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,950
to solve this mystery!

144
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,350
He had been paid not to report to the police.

145
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,950
That's why he didn't tell anybody.

146
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,850
Is that so?

147
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,250
Excuse me.

148
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,850
So, nobody came to claim the briefcase?

149
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,550
Actually, a man who claimed to be his proxy showed up

150
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,950
the next day the man in the red jacket deposited the case.

151
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,950
He was a strange man, bearded, wearing a hat and sunglasses.

152
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,550
Although the owner could not decide right away,

153
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,450
he decided to hand the envelope to the man,

154
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,950
as he was directed to do.

155
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,050
And then?

156
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,750
The man opened the envelope and read the memo right away.

157
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,150
He appeared angry

158
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,950
and tore up the memo.

159
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,050
And threw it away in the trash can in the lobby.

160
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,250
He left and never returned again.

161
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,950
What did the memo say?

162
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,450
The owner was curious and collected the pieces.

163
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,250
When he glued them together,

164
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,550
he saw seven letters

165
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,550
written hastily in blood back

166
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,550
"I will curse you to your death"!

167
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,450
Goodness, that's why I told you not to come.

168
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,350
But...

169
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,950
Don't worry!

170
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,350
Pops Kogoro will solve the mystery

171
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,950
as soon as he gets to see what's inside the case.

172
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,350
You're right.

173
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,750
And what's inside the case...

174
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,950
Could it be...

175
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,550
It's the long-haired man's hair.

176
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,650
I hate the pandemonium you stir up.

177
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,250
Welcome to Aoiya Inn.

178
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,050
"Masao Jinbo (34)" -I'll park your car in our parking area.

179
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,750
I'll leave it to you.

180
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,450
It's a great looking inn!

181
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,650
What? Is this your first time here?

182
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,650
You just said a while ago

183
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,550
you're going to ask an employee again.

184
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,550
The last time, we asked him to come over to our station.

185
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,150
Officer Yamamura!

186
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,650
Mr. Urakawa.

187
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,650
He's the one who found the body years ago.

188
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,650
His name is Mr. Urakawa.

189
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,250
Yes, I was shocked.

190
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,350
"Eiji Urakawa (37)" -I never expected to see a dead body there.

191
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,750
Although, he was nearly completely skeletonized.

192
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,450
Were you the only one who found the body?

193
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,950
-Yes. -Excuse me.

194
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,150
Do you always go picking plants all by yourself?

195
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,850
No. Mr. Jimbo, Mr. Touda who is the owner,

196
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,650
and I take turns picking plants in the forest.

197
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,250
However, I have the highest percentage of finding bodies.

198
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,450
I have the knack I feel the presence of dead bodies in the air.

199
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,550
Is that so?

200
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,950
In fact, it's usually my turn after our trip.

201
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,750
I had no choice.

202
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,050
A trip?

203
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,950
Every year before summer vacation,

204
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,350
the inn is closed for all employees

205
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,250
to participate in a group tour.

206
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,650
You see, the entrance to the forest

207
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,750
is right in front of the inn.

208
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,150
There are less people watching around here.

209
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,850
That's why more people commit suicide at that time.

210
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,950
If it is suicide, I have nothing to do.

211
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,450
Hey, isn't this person in sunglasses a police officer?

212
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,450
Oh, no, this is...

213
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,950
I am proud to present to you the great detective...

214
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,450
You must be the assistant to Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

215
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,250
-Assistant? -No. That's not it.

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,350
He is...

217
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,450
Mr. Mouri has already arrived

218
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,350
and is already waiting in his room.

219
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,850
What?

220
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,850
Are you saying that Kogoro Mouri is already here?

221
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,850
Yes, three hours earlier.

222
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,150
Then, what about the briefcase?

223
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,250
He brought it up to his room.

224
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,350
He is such a nice person.

225
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,050
He gave out autographs to all the employees

226
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,150
Please don't soil it

227
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,650
I'm planning to get it framed.

228
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,750
And, where is he now?

229
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,850
He's in Room 209

230
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,650
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

231
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,250
-Wait, Ran. -What?

232
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,450
You know, in the old Japanese samurai movies.

233
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,750
That delectable scene

234
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,050
in which the genuine one confronts the impostor.

235
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,750
Bearing the unbearable, suffering the insufferable.

236
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,750
When that impostor begins his deduction show,

237
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,850
I enter and show my genius as sleuth,

238
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,050
sweeping the crowd off their feet!

239
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,550
What kind of plan is that! How foolish!

240
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,050
Officer Yamamura, please talk some sense into him!

241
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,750
That sounds like a great idea!

242
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,050
Brilliant, isn't it?

243
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,850
Please let me in on that!

244
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,350
Leave me out!

245
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,450
Excuse me, but can I have your names?

246
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,950
His name?

247
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,550
Let's say. I'm just a plain old man named Mitsuemon Echigo.

248
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,250
I'm just a simple man

249
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,450
who travels through the country.

250
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,050
That's so cool.

251
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,750
What?

252
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,050
Just give me the cheapest room!

253
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,850
-Yes, sir. -Excuse me.

254
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,550
Your daughter appears to have left her cellphone

255
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,650
inside the car.

256
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,150
Isn't this your daughter's?

257
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,650
Thank you, I'm obliged.

258
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,450
Your gesture is appreciated!

259
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,750
Shall we be on our way?

260
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,050
Shall we take a bath and have a drink later?

261
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,050
No, thank you.

262
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,250
I do appreciate it but I am on duty.

263
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,850
He says he's Mitsuemon Echigo.

264
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,550
"Aoiya Inn"

265
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,450
Absolutely great!

266
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,750
No...

267
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,950
This way, you can do away with the impostor.

268
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,850
We'll be able to see his detective show tonight.

269
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,850
-How disgusting! -That sounds so good, right?

270
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,650
Darn it.

271
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,950
The show doesn't appear to be starting.

272
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,050
I told you to talk to him earlier!

273
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,550
That impostor might have escaped already!

274
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,450
No. It seems like nobody left the inn.

275
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,550
If he's not doing it,

276
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,950
it's time for us to go pay him a visit.

277
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,650
Hey! Are you there? Imposter!

278
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,050
Hey! Come out!

279
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,150
I'm going in.

280
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,650
Hey, it's all dark in here!

281
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,450
Hide being under covers

282
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,750
because you can't solve the mystery?

283
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,450
Wake up! The real Kogoro Mouri is here!

284
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,550
What's this?

285
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,350
This is...

286
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,510
Officer!

287
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
What's the matter?

288
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,360
Everything is the matter!

289
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,160
Detective Mouri has been found in his room, hanging from his neck!

290
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,460
What!

291
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,160
Anyway, you have to come in a hurry, too!

292
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,460
What?

293
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,560
Mr. Mouri! How can this be?

294
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,760
In my tears, your face looks distorted.

295
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
But, why did you do something foolish like this?

296
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
The Sleeping Kogoro has gone to sleep for eternity.

297
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,360
You overdid your joke!

298
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,060
What is this silly talk?

299
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,060
-What! -We haven't allowed anyone

300
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,160
into this area.

301
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,960
You'd better call your colleagues at the station,

302
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,160
as well as the forensic team!

303
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,760
A ghost!

304
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,060
What? An impostor?

305
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,460
Are you for real?

306
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,260
That man impersonated Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

307
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,060
This is the real great detective Kogoro Mouri.

308
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,560
I knew it!

309
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,660
I knew your face from somewhere.

310
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,560
Please forgive our blunder.

311
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,660
I had never seen your face.

312
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,060
But why did he pretend to be Mr. Mouri?

313
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,260
He probably wanted to see what's inside the case.

314
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,060
Look, the key is still in the keyhole.

315
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,360
True, let's look inside.

316
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,260
What?

317
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,860
This is...

318
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Sports papers?

319
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,160
Akagimaru?

320
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,460
Isn't Akagimaru that sumo wrestler

321
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,660
who retired four years ago after sustaining a serious injury?

322
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,460
Look closely!

323
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,360
This paper features the September sumo tournament five years ago!

324
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,060
That was when he drew media attention

325
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,260
for winning for the first time in 18 years.

326
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,960
Why is it here?

327
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Hey, there's something under the newspaper.

328
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,060
Look, something that looks like black yarn.

329
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
For goodness' sake.

330
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,560
It's only a bundle of hair packed in a newspaper.

331
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,760
But the hair is long!

332
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,860
I hope it's not the curse of the longhaired man

333
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,860
in the red jacket who died four years ago.

334
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,760
If a curse can kill people,

335
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,860
the police and we detectives are out of business!

336
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,660
In other words, this is what happened!

337
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,360
Five years ago, two men had a wager.

338
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Over what will happen to an athlete one year from then.

339
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,760
The two men were the long-haired man in the red jacket,

340
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,560
whose body was discovered sometime ago,

341
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
And the other, the man who claimed to be me

342
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
and was found hanging by his neck over there.

343
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
And the professional athlete is Akagimaru,

344
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,360
who enjoyed the peak of his career five years ago!

345
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,960
The longhaired man told the imposter

346
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,760
"My answer is in here."

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,660
"I will place this in the care of the inn owner"

348
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,960
"and give you the key."

349
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,760
"Let us check what will happen one year later."

350
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,160
Then, who's the bearded man with the hat?

351
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,660
He probably was the imposter.

352
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,960
The memo with the writing,

353
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,760
"I will curse you to death",

354
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,560
was probably a threat to kill

355
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
if he breaks the promise and comes earlier.

356
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,160
But the sports papers in the case...

357
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,360
what does that have to do with the answer?

358
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,060
Remember, there was one more thing with the hair.

359
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,060
When a sumo wrestler cuts his hair...

360
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,960
That means retirement!

361
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,060
You got it.

362
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,110
However, Akagimaru won the Nagoya tournament,

363
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,610
just before he suffered the fatal injury

364
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,010
and was promoted to the rank of ozeki.

365
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,810
The wager probably involved a large amount of money

366
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,510
Believing that the wrestler is not likely to retire,

367
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,410
the longhaired man committed suicide

368
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,810
before arriving at the inn.

369
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,310
But, why would this man commit suicide?

370
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,710
Because the prediction made by the longhaired man was right.

371
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,010
When he learned that the long-haired man died four years ago,

372
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,510
he wanted to know what was inside the briefcase.

373
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,010
He heard that the owner of the inn

374
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,710
had solicited my service over this case.

375
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,210
He pretended to be Kogoro Mouri

376
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,610
and was able to check what was inside the case. However...

377
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,510
The prediction turned out right.

378
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,910
He was driven by the sense of guilt of causing the long-haired man

379
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,610
to kill himself four years ago over the wager,

380
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,910
so he hang himself with his belt

381
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,110
to kill himself as well.

382
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,410
What wonderful brainwork!

383
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,310
You exceed your reputation!

384
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,110
Well... thank goodness for my agile mind!

385
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,510
Of course, you're right!

386
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,410
No one gets killed with a curse in this age of science and technology!

387
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,610
It is a curse!

388
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,710
What?

389
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,910
Here, look at this carefully.

390
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,510
The length of hair is not even,

391
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,510
some are perfect and some are dyed.

392
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,610
In addition, it's slightly wet.

393
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,510
If all this hair had been wet for five years,

394
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,810
don't you think it's a curse?

395
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,610
No! This is not the curse of the longhaired man!

396
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,910
It is the evil spirit of a hippie

397
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,710
who has long-dyed and permed hair!

398
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,110
Hey.

399
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,110
By the way, your hair was wet a while ago right, Ran?

400
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,910
Well, of course!

401
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,110
I just had a bath!

402
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,910
Don't be so nosy!

403
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,610
Bath?

404
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,310
But you told me you couldn't get into the bath in the afternoon.

405
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,710
That's because it was closed for cleaning.

406
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,810
Talking about been wet,

407
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,210
the tatami mat at the entrance

408
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,410
was a bit wet, wasn't it?

409
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,510
Well, yes...

410
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,610
Are the baths cleaned in the early evening in this inn?

411
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,710
No...

412
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,410
The baths are cleaned usually in the middle of the night.

413
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,710
That means that someone in the inn

414
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,910
hung up the sign in front of the women's bathhouse,

415
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,510
to keep people away.

416
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,210
In order to collect a large amount of women's hair

417
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,010
from the drain to bring it here.

418
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,510
Placing the hairs in between the newspapers in the case,

419
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,510
to make it look like it's the curse of the longhaired man.

420
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,610
Possibly to distract the police investigation.

421
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,010
Then... Does this mean...

422
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,310
Yes. This is homicide!

423
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,010
The tatami mat was wet probably because

424
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,910
the culprit went into the bathhouse in a hurry

425
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,110
in socked feet.

426
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,810
Then he returned to this room with wet feet.

427
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,810
And the culprit knows where the "Closed for cleaning" sign is.

428
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,710
That means, the culprit is among the employees.

429
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,310
Yes. This is a homicide.

430
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,510
The culprit probably is the person has something to do with

431
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,710
the longhaired man who died four years ago.

432
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,010
The nagging point is the strange circumstances

433
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,510
under which his body was discovered.

434
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,810
Car keys were found, but not his driver's license.

435
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,910
Cigarettes were found, but no lighter or matches.

436
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,610
And, he was wearing a sweater when it was summer

437
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,410
Most probably, the longhaired man didn't kill himself.

438
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,010
That was homicide too.

439
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,110
Someone had tampered the body

440
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,910
on purpose.

441
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,400
"Ceiling light"
