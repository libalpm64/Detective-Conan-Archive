1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,240
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,240
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,340
It's summer and hot. Time to go to sea.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,340
At a beach, an incident is awaiting us.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,950
I'm bored.

9
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,450
We came all the way to Izu Resort.

10
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,850
But, I can't swim the way I want with this body.

11
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,350
I really want my original body back.

12
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,850
I got it.

13
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,350
Oh no.

14
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,850
Are you okay, little boy?

15
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,850
I'm fine.

16
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,050
-Sorry. -Yeah.

17
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,450
-Bye, bye now. -Take care.

18
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,050
All right, I guess I'll make do with this body for a while.

19
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,050
Hey, Conan.

20
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,650
Play seriously.

21
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,550
Conan, don't forget you're it.

22
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,150
Yeah, right.

23
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,550
Well, let's start again.

24
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,250
Please, count to thirty properly.

25
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,950
So?

26
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,950
Which one of the two do you like?

27
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,150
Come on. Don't hold out.

28
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,750
You were enticed by their bodies, weren't you?

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,650
That's silly. Who cares?

30
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,950
But the young woman behind me,

31
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,350
wearing the blue striped swimsuit

32
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,450
is a different story...

33
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,950
I see.

34
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,950
You double exposed her body line

35
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,750
against the body line of you know who...

36
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,050
and were daydreaming about it, right?

37
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,150
-Cut it out. -Hey, is it you, Conan?

38
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,250
What're you doing here?

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,750
Ran.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,650
Hey, why is the snot-nose kid here?

41
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,650
I don't know.

42
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,150
I remember that Ran said she would go away with Sonoko.

43
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,150
This is the beach that Dr. Agasa was talking about.

44
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,850
Yeah.

45
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,850
Oh, no. I feel sick.

46
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,350
We're always caught up in some incident every time we take this kid along.

47
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,550
That's why we didn't bring him this time.

48
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,750
It's fine.

49
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,850
I think the more, the merrier, right?

50
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,850
Yeah.

51
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,550
"The Mystery Caught In the Net (Part 1)"

52
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,750
Hey! It's no use running away.

53
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,050
Here goes!

54
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,850
It hurts.

55
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,050
Well, have you given up yet?

56
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,650
Darn it. I'll beat you next time.

57
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,550
You're a strong player, Sonoko.

58
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,650
No, she is not.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,950
She's just a bully who enjoys picking on younger kids.

60
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,750
Where's Ran?

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,450
She went up to the shore with Conan

62
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,150
while you were getting the ball that drifted off.

63
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,350
Haibara said she's a little tired,

64
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,750
so Ran went with her.

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,150
But she said she'd come back again after taking a little rest.

66
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,550
High body temperature, dry skin with no sweating.

67
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,150
And contracted pupils, a flushed face.

68
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,550
But her pulse is strong and rapid.

69
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,650
She's got heat stroke.

70
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,350
Then, we better bring her back to the hotel quickly.

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,950
She's all right.

72
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,050
In case of moderate heat stroke like this, just resting in the shade,

73
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,050
cooling the neck, the chest and the under arms with wet towels will do.

74
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,250
I'm sure she'll be fine soon.

75
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,650
Dr. Agasa!

76
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,350
I asked a shop worker for ice and water.

77
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,150
-Thank you. -And?

78
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,550
How is she now?

79
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,350
Well, her temperature is going down,

80
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,250
so I think she will be fine.

81
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,550
That's great.

82
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,150
Please don't hesitate to let me know next time you feel sick.

83
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,250
Okay, Ai?

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,750
I'll go back to the beach where everyone is then.

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,950
Okay.

86
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,650
Oh, boy. I'm impressed by her insight.

87
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,050
Yeah. She was the first to notice something wrong with Haibara.

88
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,450
But Ai, you sort of brought it upon yourself too.

89
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,750
Just sitting there without even going into the water.

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,850
If you felt tired,

91
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,450
you should have rested with Dr. Agasa under the parasol.

92
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,050
Right.

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,150
I didn't want to feel as if I were running away.

94
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,850
What do you mean, "running away," Ai? You mean running away from sharks?

95
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,050
How stupid. There are no sharks in this area.

96
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,450
Not from sharks,

97
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,250
but from dolphins.

98
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,050
Yeah. The dolphins, one of the most popular animals in the sea.

99
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,250
The mean sharks that fled from the dark,

100
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,550
cold bottom of the sea,

101
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,050
they are no match for the dolphins.

102
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,350
Hey, what's all that mumbo jumbo about?

103
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,150
The dolphins? Aren't the sharks stronger than the dolphins?

104
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,550
You guys exhaust me.

105
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,450
Please leave me alone.

106
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,350
Hey, what do you guys think you're doing?

107
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,250
If you bump into other people on the beach,

108
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,950
while lugging that boat around somebody may get very seriously hurt.

109
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,350
What's wrong?

110
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,450
This boat was abandoned on the beach,

111
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,850
and the sea isn't rough at all.

112
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,350
So no big deal as long as we hold it steady. Right?

113
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,050
Hey, Sonoko.

114
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,150
I'm so sorry. We'll put it back where we found it right now.

115
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,250
Geez.

116
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,750
Hey, Noboru, don't talk so loud.

117
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,150
Yuuta.

118
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,050
Can't you see that the other customers look surprised?

119
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,950
"Yuuta Yoshizawa (34), Fisherman" -He's so upset now...

120
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,250
because he just got dumped by his girlfriend.

121
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,450
"Noboru Shimojo (34), Fisherman" -Don't be ridiculous.

122
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,750
She didn't dump me, I dumped her, that chick.

123
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,550
We'll put the boat back then.

124
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,650
But we're the ones who took it out so...

125
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,700
Never mind.

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,600
It's also a part of our jobs as Life Guards to clean up the beach.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,100
You're Life Guards.

128
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,100
I assumed you're fishermen but I guess it was my imagination.

129
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,800
Well, unskilled fishermen who cannot fish should just go back on shore

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
"Giichi Aramaki (51)" -and work part time jobs...

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
"Fisherman" -picking up garbage on the beach,

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
to support yourself.

133
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Says you.

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,500
We cannot fish because of you!

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,000
Stop it, Noboru.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
So, Mr. Aramaki,

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
as we decided before, we'll meet in Tong-Poo

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
in the Queens Hotel at 8 o'clock tonight.

139
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,700
We'll be waiting for you.

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Don't turn tail and run away from us.

141
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,600
Of course, I'll go.

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't you guys chicken and run out on me either.

143
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,700
Hey, Ran.

144
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,000
I think the restaurant we booked was...

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Chinese restaurant, Tong-Poo...

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh, dear, Dr. Agasa, I didn't know you guys were here.

147
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,700
Yeah, well... we're staying at this hotel.

148
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,100
Let's have dinner together.

149
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,600
Won't you sit down here with us?

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
Yes.

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,500
Where's Ai?

152
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,100
She's sleeping in her room now.

153
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,600
She says she isn't hungry so she doesn't want dinner.

154
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,900
I see.

155
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,400
What's this?

156
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,100
You seem to care deeply for that brown-headed girl, don't you?

157
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,200
I just wanted to talk to her.

158
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,800
I've barely spoken to her.

159
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
When our eyes meet, she always looks away from me.

160
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,900
I wonder if she doesn't like me?

161
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,300
No. That's not true.

162
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Oh, really?

163
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,800
Because Ms. Haibara was telling Conan,

164
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,700
"Aren't you lucky that Ran's got great buttocks?"

165
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,600
Hey, Conan, just what is this all about?

166
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Don't get me wrong. Ai said that of her own initiative.

167
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,500
Isn't having great buttocks supposed to be a compliment?

168
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,900
Some type of buttercups?

169
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,600
No, she doesn't like being buttered up.

170
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,400
I see, it's not about butts.

171
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,600
Hey, hey, didn't she say anything about me?

172
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Well...

173
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
She said you've got a light ansty butt.

174
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Oh, well...

175
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,500
Aren't you happy?

176
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
She's saying you're light, isn't she?

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Aren't you the girls and kids that we met on the beach this afternoon?

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Hi.

179
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,700
Hey, do you have the time?

180
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,200
My watch has stopped.

181
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
It's 7:12 pm.

182
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,500
Darn.

183
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,700
I came too early.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,100
All right.

185
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,200
I think a fight's about to start soon.

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,400
So, let's order quickly and eat.

187
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
It's not a fight.

188
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
We're just gonna teach that outlaw a lesson.

189
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,500
A lesson?

190
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, a lesson about the laws of nature

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that should not be broken.

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,700
He draws a seine everywhere

193
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,000
and takes whatever he can get his hands on.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,900
Yeah. We try to limit our fish catches

195
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,000
and are also doing fish farming, but...

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,100
We're not going to tolerate him coming along one day,

197
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,900
and doing everything his way. No way!

198
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,300
So tonight, we're gonna teach that guy Aramaki

199
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,500
how long it takes to restore the overfished sea

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,700
to its original state.

201
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,300
Can't you control him?

202
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I guess we can't...

203
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,700
There are regulations concerning fishing,

204
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,100
but in this neighborhood they exist in name only.

205
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,200
So, in other words, he gets to take all he wants.

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,900
Yuuta. You're late.

207
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,800
It's 8 o'clock sharp.

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,900
You're here too early, Noboru.

209
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,000
Where's Nobutsugu? Didn't he come with you?

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
He was growling that he was going to give the guy

211
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,100
a piece of his mind, right?

212
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,700
I got a call from Nobutsugu saying he'd be late

213
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,600
because he was going to visit his father's grave before coming here.

214
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Oh, yeah, today is the day our fathers died.

215
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,900
Our fathers?

216
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah. Our fathers...

217
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,200
All of them died eight years ago

218
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,200
when their ship was wrecked in a storm.

219
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,900
Well, they were happy to die a fisherman's death, I guess...

220
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,000
You don't mince your words, do you girl?

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Gee, they're sure getting along...

222
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,000
Hey, Sonoko! That's rude, you know?

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
What? Who cares?

224
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,000
Hey, come on...

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,300
Well, well...

226
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,600
It's true that despite knowing the storm was imminent,

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,900
-our fathers ventured to sea to fish. -No!

228
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,000
It was not because of the storm.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,700
"Nobutsugu Nezu (35)" -Our fathers' boat was sunk by that guy.

230
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,200
"Fisherman" -That is Aramaki's pirate ship.

231
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,100
Hey. Nobutsugu, you're still talking like that?

232
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
How rude.

233
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Anyway, where's that 'Pirate'?

234
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,800
He should be here by now.

235
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,000
It's already 8:40 pm.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I guess he forgot about us is drunk and already sacked.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,400
You got to be kidding.

238
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
All right, I'm going to rout him up.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
That's impossible.

240
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
I called him up a little while ago

241
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,100
but he didn't answer.

242
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Hello?

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Did he answer?

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,700
The call went through

245
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,100
but there's no answer.

246
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,500
I only hear a strange sound.

247
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
-A strange sound? -A strange sound?

248
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,200
This is...

249
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,100
The sound of waves?

250
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,500
Oh no. He hung up.

251
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Come to think of it...

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,300
This beach, a shortcut from Aramaki's house to this hotel, isn't it?

253
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,500
Yeah, I know.

254
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,700
But now in high water,

255
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,100
I think nobody can take the beach route.

256
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't tell me that guy is enjoying night fishing,

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
while keeping us waiting.

258
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,300
It's not likely.

259
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,600
Okay then, why don't we go there after getting sober?

260
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Oh, yeah.

261
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,910
I see, this person, Mr. Aramaki and all three of you

262
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,910
had arranged to meet at the Chinese restaurant,

263
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,310
'Tong-Poo' in that Queens hotel at 8 o'clock tonight.

264
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,810
Yet, he didn't appear at the expected time.

265
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,310
And an hour and a half after the appointed time, around 9:30 pm,

266
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,710
when you came here to check up on him,

267
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,510
Mr. Aramaki's drowned body,

268
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,910
wrapped in the net and was washed up ashore.

269
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,610
Is this right?

270
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,310
-Yeah. -Hey, You're getting too close to me.

271
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,110
We are not telling a lie.

272
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,510
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,410
You know, it's well known that you local fishermen

274
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,510
and this Mr. Aramaki were on bad terms.

275
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,110
So, I thought that you three could've drowned him here

276
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,510
and pretended that you found his body.

277
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,510
What did you say?

278
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,210
They're telling you the truth.

279
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,610
Aren't you Sonoko and Ran?

280
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,310
We heard them confirming their appointment

281
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,010
with the man who passed away, on the beach today.

282
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,110
Right, Ran?

283
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,610
Yeah. And, it's also true that they came to the Chinese restaurant.

284
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,910
See, I told you so.

285
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,710
It's true, but all three of them came separately to the restaurant.

286
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,310
Dr. Agasa?

287
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,910
That thin young man came at 7:10 pm.

288
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,810
The plump young guy at 8 pm sharp.

289
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,810
The tanned young man came around 8:40 pm.

290
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,810
Those kids don't look like you at all.

291
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,510
No, they are kids from the neighborhood.

292
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,010
Their parents asked me to take them on a trip during summer vacation.

293
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,410
So don't tell me that Conan

294
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,510
and the precocious little girl is also here.

295
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,410
You mean Ai. She's in the hotel now

296
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,210
but Conan is...

297
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,410
Look over there.

298
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,910
Hey, you... Stop that.

299
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,510
You're not allowed to touch it.

300
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,610
You know what? Don't you think it's strange, Officer Yokomizo?

301
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,610
Look!

302
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,310
He drowned but his body is full of scratches and his clothes are torn.

303
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,410
And why is he wrapped in the net?

304
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,410
Well... The murderer tried to make him drown,

305
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,310
binding his arms and legs with the net.

306
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,310
And scratches... Maybe he fought with the murderer and...

307
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,310
Hey, the police will take it from here. Your help is not necessary!

308
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,910
All right, send the body for post-mortem.

309
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,910
Yes, sir!

310
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,510
Can we go now?

311
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,110
We have to prepare to go fishing tomorrow.

312
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,310
No, you can't.

313
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,210
I have something else to ask you yet.

314
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,710
Are you still suspecting us?

315
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,910
We already told you.

316
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,410
All three of us had been waiting for him at the restaurant.

317
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,810
Yeah, but it seems more probable

318
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,510
that he had already killed before the appointed time.

319
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,510
And I don't really understand why you came to this beach to find him.

320
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,010
It's the call.

321
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,010
We waited for him until after 8pm but he didn't show up at all,

322
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,810
so I called his cell phone to ask him to come over.

323
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,410
The guy just hung up without saying anything,

324
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,710
but I heard the sounds of waves in the background.

325
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,210
The sounds of waves?

326
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,210
Yeah. That's why we came here to look for him.

327
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,710
Because this beach is a shortcut from his house to that hotel.

328
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,910
I also called him once,

329
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,810
while I was waiting alone at "Tong-Poo".

330
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,610
And called a second time after Yuuta came.

331
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,110
Which reminds me, I also called him once

332
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,210
before I went to the restaurant.

333
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,010
I did so because I wasn't sure that he was going to show up.

334
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,310
Oh, really?

335
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,210
Yeah. I heard the phone ring

336
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,310
but couldn't get him on the cell phone.

337
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,610
If you still doubt us,

338
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,310
then why don't you check his cell phone to see who called him.

339
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,110
Officer Yokomizo.

340
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,110
We found a cell phone caught in the net.

341
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,710
It seems to have dropped from his clothes.

342
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,710
What should we do?

343
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,810
Can I take a look at it?

344
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,310
Check it carefully!

345
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,310
Mine should be listed after Yuuta's.

346
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,210
According to the records,

347
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,210
Mr. Yoshizawa called at 7:02 pm.

348
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,010
Mr. Shimojo called three times at 7:47 pm,

349
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,710
8:03 pm and 8:18 pm.

350
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,210
And then Mr. Nezu called once at 8:41 pm.

351
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,610
It shows that he only answered your call, exactly as you told me.

352
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,410
Which means that the person who took the call

353
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,910
was Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer.

354
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,010
But then why didn't he take Mr. Yoshizawa and Mr. Simojo's calls?

355
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,810
How should we know?

356
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,810
Now you know that we didn't kill him, right?

357
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,510
It's true.

358
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,010
If the one who pressed the button to take the call

359
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,410
was Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer,

360
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,410
it would be almost impossible

361
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,410
for any of these three persons here to kill him.

362
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,610
But I also think it is highly unlikely

363
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,310
that the murderer would take call.

364
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,510
And if Mr. Aramaki himself took the call,

365
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,510
why didn't he take the calls from Mr. Yoshizawa and Mr. Simojo?

366
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,510
It's strange.

367
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,110
And if he took the call to ask for help

368
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,010
while being attacked by the murderer,

369
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,210
then why did he hang up the phone without a word?

370
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,410
-Hey! Look! Over there! -What?

371
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,410
Isn't that the boat we were sailing on this afternoon?

372
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,910
Yeah, it sure is.

373
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,310
Hey you, go retrieve the boat right now.

374
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,410
The boat may have something to do with this case.

375
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,910
Yes, sir.

376
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,110
Darn.

377
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,410
Yeah, that reminds me of the day when our fathers died.

378
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,110
Really. Their ship drifted back to this beach at that time,

379
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,310
just like that boat.

380
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,910
Yeah. Without her crew

381
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,410
and with the big hole in the hull.

382
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,510
Well, no amount of grieving is gonna bring them back.

383
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,110
So, let's just forget it, Nobutsugu.

384
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,710
Hey, you! What are you doing? Hurry up!

385
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,310
Bring the boat over here on the double!

386
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,310
Yes, sir.

387
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,310
Why don't you stop barking orders and go help him.

388
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,110
Oh, well... That's not my job but my men's.

389
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,410
Hey, don't tell me you can't swim.

390
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,210
How could you become a police officer anyway without knowing how to swim?

391
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,510
Your hair looks a lot like corals but can't you swim?

392
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,510
A coral?

393
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,610
Inside the boat there are a sake bottle and a sandal.

394
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,110
The pooled water in the bottom of the boat is seawater.

395
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,310
This is...

396
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,510
A button at the bottom of the boat?

397
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,610
Hey, if I remember right, the dead body is...

398
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,310
Yes... the corpse was only wearing one sandal,

399
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,310
and a button was missing from his shirt.

400
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,910
I see.

401
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,410
The murderer made must've made Mr. Aramaki drunk

402
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,310
and put him on board this boat.

403
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,610
Then wrapped him in the net,

404
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,710
threw him overboard and drowned him.

405
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,510
About the scratches on his body.

406
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,110
Perhaps he got them when he struggled with the murderer on the boat.

407
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,610
But that seems somehow unnatural to me.

408
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,910
If I were a murderer,

409
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,310
I wouldn't leave evidences like these just lying around,

410
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,310
but would throw them into the sea.

411
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,910
Stupid!

412
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,710
Don't you know that you shouldn't throw the garbage into the sea!

413
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,610
It's environmental destruction!

414
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,110
Didn't I tell you that's only if I were the murderer?

415
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,910
Conan, are you the murderer?

416
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,610
No, I was thinking from the murderer's side.

417
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,510
Oh, which side? The good or the bad?

418
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,010
Dr. Agasa.

419
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,710
Please keep an eye on these kids.

420
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,310
Hey, officer!

421
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,110
Can we start going?

422
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,310
Not yet.

423
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,310
Then hurry up and find out his estimated time of death.

424
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,010
Without that information, we can't figure anything out either.

425
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,010
We are working on it now.

426
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,710
Don't dump garbage into the sea.

427
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,310
A tin can?

428
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,710
Oh, really...

429
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,710
Are you all right?

430
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,610
I just felt something prick my hand.

431
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,510
Be careful.

432
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,610
There are many seashells lying around here.

433
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,910
Seashells.

434
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,210
Sir.

435
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,910
Were there scratches on the victim's cell phone?

436
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,310
Yes, it was badly scratched.

437
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,010
Look.

438
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,310
Now I've got it. So, that's what happened.

439
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,910
Yet I find it unlikely that the murderer would bet on such a coincidence.

440
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,010
So, he must have used a trick of some kind.

441
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,410
What is his true intention?

442
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,340
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,180
"The boat on the sand beach"

444
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,440
Next! The solution of the murder case.

445
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,220
Ai, you're so cute.

446
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,080
Yeah.
