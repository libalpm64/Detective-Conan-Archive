1
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:06,355
Okay, Conan, watch the house while I'm away.

2
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:07,555
Yep.

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:08,855
I'll be going then, bye.

4
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,055
See you, bye.

5
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:13,655
Ran's gone to club practice,

6
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:15,455
Pops is checking on an infidelity case,

7
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:18,355
and Genta guys haven't called or anything.

8
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:21,155
I guess I can take it easy today.

9
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,055
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

10
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,455
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

11
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,255
Doc and Haibara hitchhike?

12
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,055
There is a suspicious couple on the car that they get into.

13
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:32,655
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:34,455
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:37,155
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

16
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:24,123
"Dangerous Twosome"

17
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:25,318
"Mouri Detective Agency"

18
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:27,618
Hey...

19
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:30,418
Did your Beetle stop on you again?

20
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:32,131
Right...

21
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,135
I came to introduce my new invention in Yamanashi, you see.

22
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:39,418
The one that you go to every year.

23
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,318
Then the car suddenly stopped moving

24
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:42,918
on our way back home.

25
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:46,145
I did call the auto service

26
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,517
and had them tow the car away though

27
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:53,517
and had them drop us off at a nearby bus stop.

28
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:54,918
You mean the bus isn't coming?

29
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,718
Oh, no...

30
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,167
Oh, I'm sorry, we're not riding.

31
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,918
Hey, don't tell me that your wallet...

32
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:11,618
Yeah.

33
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:14,173
I must've dropped it somewhere.

34
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,718
It didn't seem to have much money inside but...

35
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,318
I see.

36
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:21,517
You called me and wanted me to ask Pops

37
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:26,517
to go and pick you up,

38
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:29,818
but Pops is out investigating an infidelity case and not home.

39
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,418
What?

40
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,718
There's nothing to get all worked up over, is there?

41
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:36,517
You can have you know who, come pick you up by cab.

42
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,618
You know who?

43
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,618
You know! Who else?

44
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,017
She's staying over at your place,

45
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:42,718
watching house anyway, isn't she?

46
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,017
The one with the stink eyes who's always yawning.

47
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,918
I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,618
I've got stink eyes and is yawning all the time.

49
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:53,918
I mean why are you there too?

50
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,618
You're always looking down

51
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,518
at Doc's inventions, aren't you?

52
00:03:57,518 --> 00:04:00,818
Right, I didn't want to come along,

53
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,223
but I didn't want to stay home and watch the house either.

54
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,818
Not in that house where the God knows who man

55
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,118
is living next door.

56
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,618
You mean Mr. Subaru Okiya?

57
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,717
Don't worry about him.

58
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,318
He seems to be a good person.

59
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:16,235
That's right!

60
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,918
Why don't you have Subaru come pick you up by car?

61
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,243
I don't know about you,

62
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,245
but I suspect him as being one of the the men

63
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:30,249
of the Black Organization as you call it, you know.

64
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,718
Subaru? No way.

65
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:35,918
I sensed it.

66
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,118
Huh?

67
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:39,618
Back then at Ikkaku Rock...

68
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,261
The pressure I felt back then...

69
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,918
was undoubtedly that of the Organization.

70
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:53,018
No way.

71
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,718
If so, both you and I would've been gone long ago.

72
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:59,418
I hope you're not locking him up in that house of yours

73
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,818
and making him watch me,

74
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,618
using me as bait

75
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:05,518
and waiting for him to make his move, are you?

76
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:08,287
Don't talk stupid!

77
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,518
I'd never do something like that!

78
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,818
At any rate,

79
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:12,291
make up a reason

80
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:15,418
and chase him out of your house, will you?

81
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,918
Because the Organization may have already found out

82
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,618
that I'm Sherry, the one who betrayed the Organization,

83
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:26,305
and Shinichi Kudo that they already thought died is still alive

84
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,307
because of information from him.

85
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,418
Right, it could be that they are slowly making plans

86
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,518
to kill us secretly behind the scene

87
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,618
and the assassins of the Organization may already be right nearby.

88
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:45,718
If you're in trouble, I'll give you a lift.

89
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,118
You don't have money on you, right?

90
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:50,118
Oh, thank you.

91
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:52,331
We're going to Tokyo, but is that okay?

92
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,335
Yes, we were just on our way back to Tokyo too.

93
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,618
Okay, then get in the backseat.

94
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:01,218
-Thank you. -I guess we'll somehow manage to get back home.

95
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:02,918
I want you to think about

96
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:04,343
chasing him out of your house

97
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,618
before we arrive back home.

98
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,818
Hey, Haibara!

99
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:12,118
Well, you really are a great help indeed.

100
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:22,361
He hasn't had much sleep last night.

101
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,918
Oh, I see.

102
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:29,918
It's a little loaded there, but bear it, will you.

103
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,018
Huh? Loaded?

104
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,118
It means that since there are things in the backseat,

105
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,018
it's a bit cluttered, isn't it?

106
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:38,377
By the way,

107
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,818
tell me, will you?

108
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,318
What?

109
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,918
How did you know

110
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:45,018
that we didn't have money?

111
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:48,387
She probably heard me talking on the phone, I think.

112
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,218
About me saying that I lost my wallet.

113
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:54,818
Do you think a person who is driving can accurately hear

114
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:57,918
what someone's saying on the side of the road?

115
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,018
It's understandable if they stopped after overtaking us,

116
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:04,718
but you stopped before overtaking us, didn't you?

117
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,818
I stopped the car,

118
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:12,218
because I saw you not boarding the bus despite it coming.

119
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:14,413
And you're saying that

120
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,218
you heard what was said when you stopped the car?

121
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,318
No, when I stopped,

122
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:23,918
the stain on the chest of that old man caught my eye.

123
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,518
I spilled coke here, you see.

124
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:32,018
You spilled it with your seatbelt fastened, didn't you?

125
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,433
Since there aren't any stains in the middle.

126
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,818
Moreover, you spilled it just a while ago.

127
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:41,118
No one would ever go out with stained clothes, you see.

128
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:42,441
Right...

129
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:46,445
Which means that you were driving till just a while ago.

130
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,918
Yet, there was no car near you.

131
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,451
And, when I bought canned coffee

132
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,018
at a vending machine alongside the road,

133
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:58,118
considering that I saw a tow truck pulling a car along back then.

134
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,459
I figured that maybe you had car trouble,

135
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:02,118
called a tow truck and had it moved.

136
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:05,418
Then, you had them drive you over to the bus stop,

137
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,918
but you realized that you had lost your wallet,

138
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,118
so even if you wanted to ride the bus, you couldn't.

139
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,118
Exactly.

140
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,918
Just as I thought.

141
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,218
So, is it okay for me to start off now, little lady?

142
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:22,481
Yes.

143
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,518
Quite a bit of traffic.

144
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:44,018
There seems to have been an accident a little beyond.

145
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,818
You can sleep if you like, until we get to where we're going.

146
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,718
Thank you.

147
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,509
By the way, where in Tokyo is your home?

148
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,718
Beikacho 2-chome.

149
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:56,318
Beikacho... what a coincidence.

150
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,518
Coincidence?

151
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:00,518
We happen to be headed there too.

152
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:04,018
To the Mouri Detective Agency at Beikacho 5-chome.

153
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:07,418
Oh! Is that so?

154
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,318
We happen to be an acquaintance of his...

155
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:15,618
I'm a bit sleepy.

156
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,818
Let's take a snooze while we can, gramps.

157
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,539
Yeah.

158
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,118
Wake us up when we get there, okay?

159
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,518
Okay.

160
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,718
What's the matter, Ai?

161
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:28,547
These people are strange.

162
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:29,518
You saw his face, didn't you?

163
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:31,718
The guy in the passenger's seat.

164
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:35,518
Yeah... he does have a large scar,

165
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:37,418
and looks sort of frightening,

166
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:39,818
but I don't see why that would make him worthy of suspicion.

167
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,418
Haven't you notice?

168
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:43,218
The back rest of the driver's seat.

169
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,718
There's one there.

170
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:51,618
And two on the left door of this backseat.

171
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:53,618
These are probably bullet traces.

172
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:54,573
What?

173
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:58,577
They may have thought it's been cleanly wiped off,

174
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,318
but there are traces of blood stains

175
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:02,581
left on the seam of the seat.

176
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,318
What?

177
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,118
Is anything the matter?

178
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:07,218
No...

179
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:09,918
Gramps talking in his sleep is so noisy.

180
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:11,018
I see.

181
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:17,118
So, let's pretend to be asleep for a while and check things out.

182
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,018
About who these two are

183
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:24,018
and why on earth they're going to the Mouri Detective Agency.

184
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,518
What is it?

185
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:32,611
It seems that we've got additional load while I was asleep.

186
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,613
I picked them up part way.

187
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,518
They seem to be acquaintances of Detective Mouri.

188
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,018
That sure is convenient...

189
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,618
we don't have to go through the trouble of looking for his place then.

190
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:46,625
By the way, what do you think of that brat?

191
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,627
What brat?

192
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,418
That boy called Conan Edogawa

193
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:52,631
that's hanging around Kogoro Mouri.

194
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:55,818
What do I think?

195
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:59,818
Well, I think he's pretty bright for a kid his age.

196
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,218
The way I see it,

197
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:04,643
I think it's that brat that's got everything under control.

198
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,018
That brat is sure some monster.

199
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:11,118
Well, we brought along a lot of gifts for him too,

200
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,718
and if we give him a sweet pat,

201
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,918
I'm sure he'll sing us a tune or two.

202
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:18,657
I wonder though, if that will do the trick?

203
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:22,018
Half killing is enough.

204
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,018
Half...

205
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:24,218
Half killing?

206
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,665
It's a bit early yet, isn't it?

207
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,918
We've still got a little more to go...

208
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,418
before we kill them all off.

209
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:37,618
I'm really looking forward to it.

210
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:43,118
I'm sure my half killing will be delightful.

211
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:47,818
It's not the usual half killing you see around.

212
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm looking forward to it.

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,699
I'm sure it'll delight him to tears.

214
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,701
My half killing after all

215
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,705
is not the usual you see around.

216
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,700
Oh, you got up?

217
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,711
Yes.

218
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you hear what we were talking about just now?

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,100
What you were saying?

220
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,900
I got up because gramps snoring was too noisy.

221
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,200
Were you talking about some thing

222
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,700
you didn't want anyone to hear about?

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,725
No. It's fine if you didn't hear anything.

224
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,800
Boy, this traffic jam is so annoying.

225
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Despite already being in Tokyo.

226
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Would you like to take a break at a drive-in

227
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
and have tea or something then?

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,500
Maybe the traffic will start moving more smoothly after we rest a while.

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,100
I'd like to hear about your connection

230
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,300
with the Mouri Detective Agency too, besides.

231
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,600
Huh?

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
But, it's only if you two are not in a rush.

233
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,500
If you want to get home that fast,

234
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,800
get off the car and fly home on your own.

235
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,500
Fly... how?

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,761
Okay, let's take a break at the drive-in then.

237
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,763
Will you look at the map for me, then?

238
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,765
It's in the dashboard.

239
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:07,900
Okay.

240
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,771
A gun?

241
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,777
"Mouri Detective Agency"

242
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:19,900
What?

243
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,500
You hitchhiked and got on the car of bad guys?

244
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,200
Yes, a twosome, a man and a woman.

245
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,787
It seems they want to get information

246
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,400
out of Detective Mouri and you.

247
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,791
Are they people from the Black Organization?

248
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,400
I wonder... I don't smell anything like that,

249
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
but they're armed with a gun.

250
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,799
Are you still with them?

251
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,100
Yes, Doc is talking with them now.

252
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
I pretended to go to the restroom

253
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,900
and am talking to you over the cell.

254
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,600
Is Doc okay, or what?

255
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
No need to worry.

256
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,800
is that we asked you to look for a cat for us.

257
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,500
No, I didn't mean that!

258
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
If they're dangerous guys,

259
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,300
I think you should get out of there as soon as possible!

260
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,600
Don't be silly.

261
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,825
They're headed that way ready to half kill you.

262
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,827
We can't just let that happen, can we?

263
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,500
Half kill?

264
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,600
That's what the man said.

265
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,500
It's enough to just half kill them.

266
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,100
That killing them all off should be put off yet.

267
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Killing everybody off?

268
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,900
In other words, they going to half kill you all

269
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,800
and get whatever information they want from you,

270
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,845
then kill us all off, right?

271
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,200
Hey, are you sure that they aren't from the Black Organization?

272
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, I can't say for sure just yet.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And if that thing that they want to hear from you is about me,

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,857
the whereabouts of the one who betrayed the Organization,

275
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,859
everything will fall in place.

276
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:43,400
If you're at that drive-in,

277
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
I can speed over on my skateboard...

278
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,100
In 30 minutes.

279
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,400
Please hold them in place somehow until I get there.

280
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,500
Hold them in place, how?

281
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,875
Just say something like you coincidentally ran into an acquaintance

282
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,877
who's going back to Tokyo from Chiba

283
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,879
and that you're going to have that person drive you home.

284
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Chiba?

285
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,200
We're at a drive-in that's on our back

286
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,700
from Yamanashi to Tokyo, you know?

287
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,800
They'll figure out that it's a lie right away.

288
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
If they found out you lied,

289
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
they'll think that something happened

290
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,100
and look for you guys, won't they?

291
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,500
I see, so you want us to hide somewhere

292
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,899
in the drive-in till then.

293
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,000
But, if they don't see through the lie...

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,905
They'd be no problem.

295
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll call Officer Takagi and ask him to ambush them

296
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,000
at the Detective Agency and arrest them.

297
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,400
I'll tell him that they're armed with a gun and dangerous.

298
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,400
I think I'd be handle the two

299
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,100
with the tranquilizer gun and my soccer ball.

300
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,300
But what after that?

301
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,900
What if they're men from the Black Organization?

302
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:53,600
On a car of a friend going from Chiba to Tokyo.

303
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,933
Lucky you.

304
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh, yes.

305
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Thank you for giving us a lift all the way here.

306
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,939
Goodbye.

307
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,800
They're lying.

308
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,500
Yes, but I wonder why?

309
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,200
They heard us talking about half killing.

310
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,955
That we were talking about a while ago.

311
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,700
Just as you had hoped,

312
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,400
the twosome figured out that it was a lie right away

313
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,963
and are looking all over for us.

314
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,700
And where are you two?

315
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,100
For now, we're in the toilet.

316
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,600
But, it's just a matter of time until they find us.

317
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,100
It could be someone involved in a case that Pops handled

318
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,977
and solved before that has a grudge against him too.

319
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,700
Tell me what the two are like.

320
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
The woman is wearing a knitted cap and wearing sunglasses.

321
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,600
Her bangs are divided to the right and left and over her forehead.

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,989
The man is tanned and is unshaven.

323
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,700
I saw that he had a big scar on his left eye.

324
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
A large scar on his left eye?

325
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, he sure isn't someone straight.

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,800
There was a gun in the dashboard of the car.

327
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,500
In the car there are three bullet marks

328
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,800
and traces of blood being wiped off.

329
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,600
Did you notice anything else?

330
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
What else could there be?

331
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, that's right.

332
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,100
They used strange language.

333
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,017
Strange language?

334
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,400
It's a bit cluttered, but please bear it,

335
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,700
and if you want to get home that fast,

336
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,600
get off the car and fly home on your own.

337
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
Cluttered... fly?

338
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Maybe it's a code or something?

339
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,700
At any rate, I'll be there in five minutes.

340
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
So stay still over there till...

341
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,600
Hey gramps, are you there?

342
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,300
If there, answer me!

343
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,039
It's occupied!

344
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,700
I guess we don't have much of a chance.

345
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,200
He's going around knocking on all the doors of the toilet.

346
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I'll be right out!

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,047
What shall we do?

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Wait a second.

349
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
The words cluttered and fly are...

350
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Conan?

351
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,055
Half kill and kill them all...

352
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,200
Conan?

353
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,800
A large scar on his left eye...

354
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,500
Hey, what's up?

355
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,000
Here he comes.

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Answer me, I said!

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,067
Conan.

358
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,700
Don't worry.

359
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,071
If you shout in an adult voice

360
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,073
that you're using the toilet,

361
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,075
I'm sure he'll leave right away.

362
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,700
That man will probably be hesitant

363
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,800
if he learns that a woman is inside.

364
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,500
I guess so...

365
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,100
I guess the gramps seems to be in here.

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,300
How rude! Can't you see that I'm using the toilet?

367
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,800
You lewd dirty rat!

368
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Oh, sorry...

369
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Wait. This is the men's room.

370
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
I figured.

371
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
Doc would never use the women's restroom.

372
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,600
Figured...

373
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,700
Maybe he figured out at hearing my voice just now.

374
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Isn't there a little window in the toilet

375
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,123
where you can make it outside?

376
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,500
There is...

377
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,700
Then, get out of there with Doc.

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What after we get out?

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,300
Well, when you get out of there, it's most likely that...

380
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,400
The woman will be waiting

381
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,200
and not long after her...

382
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm sure the man will come.

383
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,500
Give in and get caught already.

384
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,900
Give in?

385
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,165
It'll be all right.

386
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,900
These two are...

387
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
police officers.

388
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,173
Police officers...

389
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,700
But, why are you wearing sunglasses?

390
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,300
The thing is, the other day...

391
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,800
"Yui Uehara, age 29" -a culprit I was escorting along

392
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
"Yui Uehara, age 29" -punched me and I ended up with black and blue.

393
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,500
You're lucky that all you got was a bruise.

394
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,700
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -The shot that the guy

395
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,800
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -fired skimmed pass my forehead,

396
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,191
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -and this is how I ended up.

397
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,800
"Mouri Detective Agency"

398
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,400
Well, with that scar and those sunglasses,

399
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,285
it can't be helped that they thought you were bad guys.

400
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,500
Just the other day I arrested a guy,

401
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,200
but the instant I got him in the car,

402
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,293
he fired randomly with the gun he had on him.

403
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:56,400
And when we pinned him down to arrest him,

404
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,300
I got this bruise on my right eyes

405
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,299
and Kan-chan hurt his forehead.

406
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,301
The bullet traces and blood stain in the car

407
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,303
were made back then.

408
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,600
But, amazing how you figured out it was us.

409
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,400
Tsumoi in Nagano dialect means cluttered

410
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,700
and fly means to run home.

411
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,500
Besides, Inspector Yamato is the only one

412
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,100
at the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

413
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,317
who knows us well

414
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,100
and has a big scar on his left eye.

415
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,100
But, I think that the joke was carried too far this time.

416
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,325
Saying things like half killing and kill them all.

417
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:30,000
That's why we thought you mistook us

418
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
for being dangerous people and fled.

419
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,331
So, we came to look for you,

420
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:37,100
thinking that you fled despite having no cash on you.

421
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
Mistook you?

422
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,300
The phrase half killing means...

423
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,700
this rice cake.

424
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,800
It looks so good!

425
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes, Kan-chan's rice cake is the best

426
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,353
because his grandmother taught him how to make it.

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,700
And why is the Bota rice cake called half killing?

428
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,400
It's called half killing

429
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,363
because only half of the mocha rice is smashed to make it.

430
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,800
By the way, when all the mochi rice is smashed,

431
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,367
it's called killing all.

432
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:13,371
In other words, killing them all off can be put off till later means,

433
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,900
New Year's when mochi is eaten is still sometime away, right?

434
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,100
Exactly.

435
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,379
Is that how people in Nagano refer to it?

436
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:26,100
No, Kan-chan after hearing that old folklore from his grandmother,

437
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,800
is using it that way in his own way.

438
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,700
Kan-chan loves stimulating trouble toned words, you see.

439
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,900
And what happened in Nagano?

440
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,395
I'm sure you didn't come here

441
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:38,600
just to bring us the mochi, did you?

442
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,800
Oh, well, there's something we just can't solve.

443
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,000
So, we wanted you to help us out.

444
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
The mystery about the blood smeared Red Wall.

445
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,300
What?

446
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,300
The blood smeared...

447
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,400
mystery of the Red Wall?

448
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,420
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,423
"Red spray"

450
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,886
The title of the next episode is sure disturbing.

451
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,427
Your stomach sure needs to get rid of disturbing fat too.

452
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,620
I'm that fat?
