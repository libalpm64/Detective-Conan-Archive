1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,590
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,790
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,690
Those two have our complete attention.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,890
A wager between two adults causes the case to expand.

5

He sees through the one and only truth.

A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,490
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,600
Hey, Miwako!

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,800
An officer of the renowned Metropolitan Police Department

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,900
First Investigation Division is lying around during the day

11
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,400
with her mouth full of tangerines while watching TV.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,600
Give me a break.

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,500
It's my day off. It won't hurt to take it easy, will it?

14
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,400
Here, then.

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,100
Not again! Pictures of my marriage mate candidates.

16
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,900
If you've got time to be loafing around, you should look through them.

17
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,450
No way! I'm sick and tired of looking at pictures

18
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,150
because I've got to look at bloody pictures of autopsies

19
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,950
all the time.

20
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,450
How did you ever end up turning into such a tomboy?

21
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,950
It's all my fault.

22
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,150
I raised you by giving you too much freedom.

23
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,450
I couldn't possibly face up to your father who died on duty

24
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,850
and is watching over us from the heavens.

25
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,450
Okay, then.

26
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,850
But I'm just merely going to meet them. That's all.

27
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,850
Oh, my! Just as would be expected of my daughter.

28
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,150
You have the same taste as I when it comes to men.

"Love Story At Police Headquarters 4 (Part 1)"

30
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,650
What? Officer Sato is going to meet

31
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,850
a marriage mate candidate?

32
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,050
Right!

33
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,350
I'm sure that Miwako is all dressed up by now

34
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,450
and are meeting up with that man.

35
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,550
Just who is that man?

36
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,450
Miwako doesn't know either.

37
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,950
Because she told me she chose the picture of her would-be-mate

38
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,950
without even looking inside the envelope.

39
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,050
No way!

40
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,750
You mean she's meeting a man

41
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,250
she doesn't even know the looks of?

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,350
No problem, though!

43
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,050
He's a man that decided to meet a woman officer

44
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,350
who is in active duty, right?

45
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm sure he's a very independent and reliable,

46
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,150
square middle aged man.

Hey, hey!

49

10 minutes have already gone by

50
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,150
since the promised time of meeting!

51
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,950
A man who has the nerve to keep a lady waiting

52
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,750
couldn't be worth much anyway!

53
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
I'm leaving.

54
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,950
It's not big deal, he's only 10 minutes late.

55
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,850
Ms. Sato?

56
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,350
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

57
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,950
I am Isokichi Kamoi,

58
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,150
please remember me from here on after.

59
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,650
What's this?

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,950
Is this old man supposed to be my marriage candidate?

61
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,750
No! He's the butler!

62
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,950
Well, since this meeting popped up so suddenly...

63
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,550
My master and his wife are on a trip abroad,

64
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,950
so sire asked to come along in their place.

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,650
Sire?

66
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,050
Hi, I'm so sorry.

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,050
I took a while to choose flowers that would suit you, Ms. Sato.

68
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,250
Oh, no.

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,450
I shouldn't call you Ms. Sato today, but rather...

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,350
would it be all right for me to call you Miwako?

71
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,950
Shiratori?

72
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,450
Long time no see, Mother.

73
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,450
Hello.

74
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,250
What? Why?

75
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,050
Just what are you talking about?

76
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,150
You chose him yourself, didn't you?

77
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,350
-Huh? -Being attracted to a police officer,

78
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,150
no doubt you're my daughter after all.

79
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,100
You mean no one in the First Investigation Division

80
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,900
knows about her meeting today?

81
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
Does that mean even Officer Takagi doesn't know about it, too?

82
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
No.

83
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
She said that she would never agree to going out with the man anyway,

84
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,300
and is embarrassed, so she was keeping it a secret.

85
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,600
Besides, Miwako is quite popular with the guys

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,500
that if the word goes out, it may cause a commotion.

87
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
But...

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,700
what if the man she is seeing wants to marry her?

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,100
No problem! Because it's all worked out

90
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,800
that she'll get out of there when the time is right.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,400
Nobody would ever want to marry a woman

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
who splits the scene saying

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
that she has to go cover a case, right?

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,700
But who's going to do that?

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,000
You silly thing. Who else but Officer Takagi?

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm going to mail him on his phone with the message,

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
"Miwako is in trouble!"

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
And say that a criminal case has come up

99
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,700
and take her away from where she is.

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sure that he'll going bursting in with a face

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
that you've never seen before.

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
You witch.

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,900
He may just confess how he feels for her

104
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,100
if situation pushes him to do so.

105
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,400
Hey, why don't we go there too?

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
But it's pretty far from here.

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,300
Why don't you give us a lift there, Officer Yumi?

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,900
I can't because I'm still on duty.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
What are you all doing here?

110
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Dr. Araide!

111
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
Lucky!

112
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,500
Huh?

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,000
What an honor.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,800
To think that you chose me

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
from among the number of candidates that you have.

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
So, like I've been saying it was sheer coincidence!

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
The picture that I chose without even looking at

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,300
happened to be you.

119
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
Oh, Miwako.

120
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
You're saying something like that just to hide your embarrassment.

121
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,600
I rather prefer that it was a coincidence.

122
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Because it would mean

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,900
that your beautiful fingers were guided

124
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
to my picture by some work of God.

125
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,800
I feel that it was a work of fate.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
That's right.

127
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,600
Splendid, Sire!

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,100
I can't possibly tell him

129
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,800
that I picked his picture up with my toes.

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,700
I wonder if Yumi's really going to carry out the planned.

131
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,500
I'll send my kid brother over, so hang in there.

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,700
She promised me by saying so.

133
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I wonder who she means by kid brother?

134
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,800
Are you all right, Officer Takagi?

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
You've been sneezing quite a bit.

136
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Hold on.

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,100
Yes, Takagi here.

138
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,700
Oh, Officer Takagi?

139
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,100
Did you read the mail I sent you?

140
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,000
Mail?

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Robber!

142
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,000
Someone, please catch him!

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Let's go after him, Officer Chiba!

144
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Yes, sir!

145
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Hello, Officer Takagi?

146
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,300
Hey, are you listening?

147
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
Hey, Officer Takagi!

148
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,000
Excuse me, we're the police.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
Please let us through!

150
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,400
Oh, there he is! That's him!

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
He went into the alley!

152
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't let him get away!

153
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,800
Are you all right, Mister?

154
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,100
Did you see someone wearing a helmet?

155
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,100
The guy rammed into me

156
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,600
and ran towards the restroom of the park.

157
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
Officer Takagi!

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,100
There's a helmet, a coat, a bag and gloves.

159
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,400
There's no doubt about it,

160
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,500
the man who robbed the convenience store is inside the restroom.

161
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
Police! There's no use trying to flee any further!

162
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,300
Come out quietly!

163
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,600
"Hiroshi Zama (21)" -Hey, what's with all the fuss?

164
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,000
"Eiko Koshimizu (28)" -What do you want?

165
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
"Yasuo Kamieda (32)" -What would the police want to with me?

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
There's three people?

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,500
These are the three people who were using the restroom

168
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,700
Well?

169
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,100
Can you make out who bumped into you?

170
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,500
Not really.

171
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,100
Because my glasses fell off when the person bumped into me,

172
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,500
so I couldn't see very well since my vision was blurred.

173
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,200
Any little thing will do!

174
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Please tell me what you remember!

175
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, the person was taller than me.

176
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
She was a girl wearing blue clothes under her coat!

177
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,700
A girl?

178
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,800
Ms. Koshimizu is the only woman,

179
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,000
but the clothes she's wearing is black.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,800
What am I supposed to do? That's all I remember!

181
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey! I don't have any idea what's going on, but...

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
If we have nothing to do with what's going on,

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,300
can we head on home?

184
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,400
I've got other commitments after this.

185
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Please wait!

186
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,100
You may leave

187
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,000
only after we finish questioning the other witnesses!

188
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,700
What?

189
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,300
Shiratori? Don't tell me that he's the one from the police department?

190
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,500
Yes, he's in the Tsuru Room together with Ms. Sato.

191
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,300
Which means that the man Officer Sato is meeting is...

192
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
Inspector Shiratori?

193
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,400
Would you like me to take them a message?

194
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, well...

195
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
We were asked by the two families

196
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,200
to bring them an interesting gift.

197
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,200
It's going to take some time to prepare,

198
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,100
so will you please let us use the room next to the Tsuru Room?

199
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes, sure. It just so happens to be vacant.

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
Thank you, Miss!

201
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,700
Please wait a while, then.

202
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm very sorry to trouble you.

203
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,100
That kid is pretty sharp.

204
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, my! How delicious!

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,100
We had our chef come over to cook for us here

206
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,400
so that you could taste the kind of meal

207
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,900
that we eat at the Shiratori residence,

208
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,300
and had him make these exquisite Japanese dishes!

209
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,300
Sire had informed us that Ms. Miwako doesn't like French cuisine.

210
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,100
Huh? Did you have food that you didn't like?

211
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
Hey, Miwako?

212
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,800
Oh, yes.

213
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,600
Excuse me!

214
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
Is there anyone who witnessed the robber

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in this convenience store a while ago?

216
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,550
Hey, Officer!

217
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,850
Wouldn't it be faster for you to ask the employee

218
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,550
of the convenience store?

219
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,350
We already did!

220
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,350
She said the robber stuck out a knife and showed a paper

221
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,950
that said "Give me the cash",

222
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,150
so the only thing she remembers is the helmet and coat.

223
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,250
What a hopeless case.

224
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,650
Darn it. Give me a break.

225
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,250
Excuse me, Officer.

226
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
Yes?

227
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,250
I can tell you how tall the robber was.

228
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,250
The person who was wearing a helmet and a coat, right?

229
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,350
I was watching through the window of the shop,

230
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,150
but I saw the person's head sticking out of the throng of people,

231
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,950
so I think the person's height was about 180 centimeters.

232
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,650
180 centimeters would be the tallest of the three,

233
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,050
Mr. Zama.

234
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,550
Come to think of it, he was wearing a blue sweater.

235
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,750
Oh, when the person's coat flipped over a bit,

236
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,850
I saw the color green!

237
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,450
Not blue?

238
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,750
No, I'm positive that it was green!

239
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,150
Were able to tell if it was a man or a woman?

240
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,950
With a height of 180 centimeters, wouldn't it be a man?

241
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,950
I see.

242
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,850
-Hey, Officer! -Yes?

243
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,650
That coffee shop owner

244
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,750
was bragging that he looked at the robber close.

245
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,650
Really?

246
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,350
Yes, I sure saw him!

247
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,150
The weirdo wearing a helmet who went running off!

248
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:03,950
It was when I was getting the samples of the lunch time menu out.

249
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,150
Can you give me the characteristics of that person?

250
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,550
I'm not sure if the person was a man or woman,

251
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,750
but the height was about 170 centimeters.

252
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,950
The person had a coat over black clothes.

253
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,450
Did you say black?

254
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,950
About 170 centimeters would be Mr. Kamieda.

255
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,850
But he is wearing green colored sweater.

256
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,850
Hey, what's going on?

257
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,210
Well, I guess we'll excuse ourselves for a while.

258
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,010
You two take your time and talk things out together.

259
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,710
Hey, Yumi.

260
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,310
When is she coming to pick me up?

261
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,110
I see.

262
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,910
So someone is supposed to come rescue

263
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,810
the beautiful princess from the hands of the evil prince?

264
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,610
Don't be ridiculous!

265
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,210
Just what are you talking about?

266
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,110
Okay, let's do this.

267
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,910
If Officer Takagi comes to get you,

268
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,710
I shall gracefully back down.

269
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,010
But if he chickens out and doesn't show up,

270
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,310
you will be my wife.

271
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,110
Huh? Why is it Officer Takagi?

272
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,810
Why not?

273
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,210
It's just a joke!

274
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,310
I just wanted to see you look troubled.

275
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,410
All right, then.

276
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,710
Huh?

277
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,110
It's a deal!

278
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,410
What?

279
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,110
Officer Takagi, just what is going on?

280
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,410
What do you mean by the testimonies

281
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,810
of the witnesses don't match?

282
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,310
There were three witnesses in all, weren't there?

283
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,610
Yes, all three of them

284
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,810
remembered the characteristics of the robber very well.

285
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,110
The old man who bumped into the robber said

286
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,110
that it was a woman wearing blue clothes.

287
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,610
The girl who was watching through the window of a shop said

288
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,610
that the robber was more than 180 centimeters tall,

289
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,110
wearing green clothes, and most probably a male.

290
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,110
And the owner of the coffee shop insisted that

291
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,110
the robber was about 170 centimeters and was wearing black clothes.

292
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,810
All three witnesses had something absolutely different to say.

293
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,010
Right.

294
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,010
I don't believe they told a lie.

295
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,710
I guess so.

296
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,710
Shall we begin interrogating the three suspects, then?

297
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,910
Yes.

298
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,010
What do you mean by it's a deal?

299
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,910
Are you sure you know what you're talking about?

300
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,210
Yes, I do.

301
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,610
If Officer Takagi comes here to get me,

302
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,210
then this meeting for possible marriage

303
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,310
is called off immediately, right?

304
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,810
If he doesn't show up, I marry you and become your wife.

305
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,610
Instead of waiting without a time limit,

306
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,610
how about we set the limit at sundown?

307
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,410
Hey, you've got to be joking, Officer Sato.

308
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,710
Things are starting to sound really interesting, right?

309
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,310
But what if Officer Takagi doesn't show up?

310
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,910
It could be that Officer Sato

311
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,010
is following the "Cinderella" story, you know.

312
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,610
Inspector Shiratori is after all the son of a tycoon

313
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,910
that attends most of the parties held at my house.

314
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,710
I thought that Officer Sato and Officer Takagi

315
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,810
was really getting along well though.

316
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,210
Well, she went as far as to say what she did.

317
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,210
So, I think she thinks that the odds are in her favor.

318
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,510
Okay. So, it's all right with you then?

319
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,510
Yes! I will not go back on my word!

320
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,510
That's right, it's Officer Takagi.

321
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,610
I'm sure that he's the one that's going to pick me up

322
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,710
that Yumi was talking about!

323
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,810
Yes, I'm sure that he'll come.

324
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,810
I'm sure?

325
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,610
Why?

326
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,210
My name is Yasuo Kamieda. I teach at a prep school.

327
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,510
I stopped over at that restroom

328
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,510
on my way to a book store nearby where I was planning to buy a book.

329
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,410
I'm Hiroshi Zama, a part-time worker.

330
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,710
I just happened to use that restroom

331
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,310
on my way back from band practice.

332
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,410
I'm Eiko Koshimizu. I work at an office.

333
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,710
I was taking a walk when I suddenly came down with a stomachache.

334
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,810
So I went to that restroom.

335
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,310
Now that I've said all I have to say, let me go!

336
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,410
It's already after 2:00!

337
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,210
Huh? You're wearing two wristwatches?

338
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,110
My boyfriend's abroad,

339
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,410
so I'm wearing a wristwatch showing the time of the country he's in.

340
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,010
It's not nice calling him at a ridiculous time, is it?

341
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,310
Back in middle school,

342
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,510
a teacher told me to wear two wristwatches, too.

343
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,810
Because I was always late for class.

344
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,310
Hey, mister! What's so funny?

345
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,810
Well, I always tell my students at prep school

346
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,710
to take off their watches during class,

347
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,610
so I just thought what a difference.

348
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,510
You mean the wristwatches of the students?

349
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,910
Yes, because I want them to concentrate on the lessons

350
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,210
without thinking of time.

351
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,810
I also removed clocks of the classroom

352
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,710
as thinking out other things to help them.

353
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,410
By the way, what about the band you just mentioned, Mr. Zama?

354
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,810
Oh, I'm playing in the band with my high school friends.

355
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,410
It's a visual type band!

356
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,510
When I play in the band, I dress like a woman.

357
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,010
I may not look it, but I get a lot of calls from my fans

358
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,410
and I'm pretty popular, too.

359
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,410
Oh, I see.

360
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,610
Oh, talking about phone calls,

361
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,710
there was a call for you from Officer Yumi a while ago.

362
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,210
She said for you to read the mail she sent you.

363
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,210
I'll bet she wants to go singing karaoke or something again.

364
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,710
Little does she know of the predicament I'm in.

365
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,510
A convenience store robbery?

366
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,810
Oh, no.

367
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,210
I just had something I wanted to ask Officer Takagi.

368
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,910
Please tell him to give it his best shot, Inspector Megure.

369
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,810
Hey, what's this about a convenience store robbery?

370
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,110
Wasn't Officer Takagi supposed to be checking on a case today?

371
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,110
After he finished checking on the case,

372
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,510
he seems to have run into the convenience store robbery case.

373
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,310
It seems he's already narrowed the suspects downto three people, though.

374
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,610
It seems the testimony of the witnesses are a bit various.

375
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,510
What do you mean various?

376
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,510
There's only one suspect, isn't there?

377
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,910
Well, I don't have the slightest idea.

378
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,910
Okay, I'll contact Officer Takagi myself, then.

379
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,710
It's against the rule for you to call him from your side.

380
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,410
It's much too disadvantageous for me.

381
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,910
Well, I'm sure everything will turn out all right.

382
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,310
He'll rush over here as soon as he arrests

383
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,310
the convenience store robber.

384
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,110
Or maybe you don't believe he will?

385
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,710
It's not like that.

386
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,610
Then again, if a police officer abandons the case

387
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,010
in the midst of an investigation,

388
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,610
and shows up in a place like this,

389
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,010
he'll have to go through disciplinary action

390
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,210
taken against him for violating duty regulations.

391
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,610
If I remember correctly,

392
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,310
he went through a pay cut once before, didn't he?

393
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,910
If he has the guts to show up here knowing

394
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,910
that he may have to undergo disciplinary action for the second time,

395
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,710
I'll admit that he's been a man about the whole thing.

396
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,210
The situation doesn't look too good, does it?

397
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,610
Oh, come on. We can't just do nothing!

398
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,810
Quiet.

399
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,110
I've got to go to the restroom.

400
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,010
Officer!

401
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,710
Just how long to you intend to keep us locked up in this car?

402
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,910
The sun's going to set!

403
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,010
Just a little while longer.

404
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,910
Hello, Officer Yumi? My hands are tied just yet and...

405
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,010
Hi, this is Shinichi Kudo.

406
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,110
What?

407
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,010
Conan asked me to give you a call.

408
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,510
What did Conan ask you to do?

409
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,110
Please check your cell phone mail

410
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,910
and take note of the situation that you're in now.

411
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,210
But the only mail I got today was from Officer Yumi.

412
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,110
"Miwako is in trouble!

413
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,810
Resue her from Minatoro where she is holding a marrige meeting."

414
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,010
Officer Sato is meeting her husband to be?

415
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,710
So, you haven't read the mail, have you?

416
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,210
But don't worry, and please calm down.

417
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,310
There's still a lot of time to go until sundown,

418
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,610
and the place she's meeting him is in the neighboring town, Haido-cho.

419
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,110
Sundown?

420
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,110
Officer Sato agreed to the terms that her proposed husband suggested.

421
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:52,910
If you don't solve the case by sundown and go to get her,

422
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,810
she's going to have to accept her partner's marriage proposal.

423
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,910
Please give me the details of the case.

424
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,410
Officer Takagi?

425
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,510
Officer Takagi, can you hear me?

426
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,910
Hey...

427
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,410
I see.

428
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,610
All three suspects that was testified

429
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,310
has totally different characteristics of the robber.

430
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,010
How interesting!

431
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,910
What do you mean by interesting, Kudo?

432
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,210
First of all,

433
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,210
go to that coffee shop and talk to Mr. Mamehara, the owner.

434
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,000
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,980
"Wristwatch"

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,980
Officer Sato, just between us, tell me how you really feel.

437
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,520
Inspector Shiratori gets one point.
