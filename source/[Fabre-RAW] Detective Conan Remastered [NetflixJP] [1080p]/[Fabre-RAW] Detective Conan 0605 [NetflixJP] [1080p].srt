1
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:09,478
If that person is the culprit,

2
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:12,378
Mr. Hirasaka didn't commit suicide.

3
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,978
In order to prove that,

4
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:18,678
I've got to solve the mystery of the two locked rooms!

5
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,001
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

6
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,578
Tears are the start of all dramas.

7
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,378
So, he was the real culprit!

8
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:28,378
Everything is finally clarified!

9
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,009
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,011
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,878
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:19,294
On the night that a seance was held at the residence

13
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:21,694
of occult cartoonist, Mr. Reiki Hirasaka,

14
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:24,694
a series of locked room murders are committed.

15
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:27,894
The incident was connected with the murder

16
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:30,129
of the editor in charge of Mr. Hirasaka's work,

17
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:33,394
Mr. Sawanami that occurred six months ago.

18
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:36,694
The word "Kira" was found left behind at the scene.

19
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:39,694
What on earth does this mean?

20
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:40,694
"Kira"

21
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:47,894
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (Locked Room Opened)"

22
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,594
Mr. policeman!

23
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:58,157
Did you see my Gomera badge in the room?

24
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:01,494
Gomera badge? I got no such report.

25
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:02,994
May I go look for it?

26
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:04,594
What?

27
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:11,694
The two keys were found inside the drawer.

28
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:16,175
It's possible to throw the keys into the drawer via that window vent.

29
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,194
However...

30
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:19,694
Is it possible for them to also put a notebook atop those

31
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:22,694
and lock the drawer?

32
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,694
And...

33
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:26,594
Kira's posters that were torn apart

34
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:28,494
and scattered all over the place.

35
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,094
Why was something like that done?

36
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,794
Hey, hurry up out of there.

37
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:39,694
Just a little while more. One second!

38
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:44,194
Mr. Policeman, there's something on top of that flower.

39
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,494
Let me see it!

40
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:53,094
This is a torn piece from Kira's poster!

41
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,217
Why is it on that flower?

42
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,994
I see!

43
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,594
Maybe...

44
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:04,694
Forensics lady!

45
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,294
My? Sonny, you're the one staying over at Mr. Mouri's.

46
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,229
Did you see my Masked Yaiba card on the floor?

47
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:13,694
I seemed to have dropped it when I came in here last night.

48
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:15,294
No, nothing was on the floor.

49
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,594
I'll go take a quick look!

50
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,094
Sonny!

51
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,694
There's no footing to climb up to that window in the room.

52
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:27,794
Besides, in order to close that window,

53
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:30,994
that switch would have to be pushed all the while.

54
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:38,257
However, the door was locked from the inside with a padlock.

55
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,261
You can't lock the door from the outside.

56
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:48,894
Maybe...

57
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:01,394
I get it. That's the story.

58
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,894
I'll look for the card for you so...

59
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:08,294
Yes. I'm sorry.

60
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,293
But, why did the culprit have to go out of the way

61
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,494
to create a locked room?

62
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:19,594
As for Mr. Hirasaka,

63
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,694
it was probably to make it look like he committed to suicide.

64
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:25,294
Maybe there's a secret way out

65
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,694
of the meditation room or something?

66
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,894
If it's as I suspect,

67
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:37,294
this locked room is much too sad.

68
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:41,394
I've solved the mystery of the locked room.

69
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,594
but there's no proof.

70
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,794
Why not check if there's an

71
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:49,694
escape route out of the meditation room?

72
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:53,894
There's no such thing. Not in that room!

73
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:56,335
No use doing something like that!

74
00:05:56,335 --> 00:06:01,494
Because Kira used magical powers to escape from that room.

75
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,794
Isn't this room hot?

76
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,345
Then, why don't you loosen your necktie?

77
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:08,347
Like always.

78
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,994
But, it's not good to look too untidy

79
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,294
despite the police being here, right?

80
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:15,894
Maho, do you feel bad or something?

81
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,357
No. I'm fine.

82
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:23,194
Wait a second. That person just...

83
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:24,363
I see.

84
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:28,894
Maybe the culprit left definite evidence behind?

85
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,894
Pops, over this way!

86
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:34,373
-Hurry up. -Hey, what on earth did you find?

87
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,375
Look, it's just over there.

88
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,694
What?

89
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:39,494
Wait.

90
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:49,194
Leave the rest to me, Pops.

91
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:51,694
Everyone!

92
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:56,794
From now, I will tell you the truth of this case.

93
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,394
Last night, the body of Ms. Shoko Utakura

94
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:02,094
was found in this meditation room,

95
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:05,494
and Mr. Hirasaka was also found dead in his room.

96
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:07,794
Near Mr. Hirasaka's dead body,

97
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,094
the rope that was used to kill Shoko

98
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,894
was found together with her cell phone.

99
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:14,794
Judging from this circumstance,

100
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:18,417
it would look as if Mr. Hirasaka, after killing Shoko

101
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:19,994
committed suicide.

102
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,994
You mean it's not suicide?

103
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,894
No, it's most likely that the culprit

104
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,994
first went to Mr. Hirasaka's room

105
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:29,794
and killed him after giving him poisoned wine.

106
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,394
Then the culprit got hold of key

107
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,994
for the padlock and the room.

108
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:37,194
Then the culprit locked the room from the outside,

109
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:39,994
then killed Shoko in the meditation room.

110
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:43,894
The posters were pulled out from all the panels

111
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:46,445
after which the culprit went back to Mr. Hirasaka's room.

112
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,094
The culprit put the two keys, the murder weapon rope

113
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,994
and Shoko's cell phone in the room

114
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:54,994
to frame Mr. Hirasaka up as the killer.

115
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,294
Do you have proof?

116
00:07:57,294 --> 00:08:01,894
On the flower that was decorated outside Mr. Hirasaka's room,

117
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:04,094
a ripped piece of the poster was found.

118
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,465
What? Is that true?

119
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,994
It's this one.

120
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:12,094
-Here! -This was...

121
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:14,494
on the flowers that was in the vase?

122
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,894
In other words, the culprit ripped the poster in the corridor

123
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:19,594
and put the pieces into the room

124
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:22,481
through the ventilation window.

125
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:25,494
Why did the culprit do something like that?

126
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:27,394
The more I don't understand.

127
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:30,994
I shall replay the locked room trick now.

128
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,794
-What? -Officer Takagi, Officer Chiba!

129
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,594
Yes, sir!

130
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:38,494
What are you people doing there?

131
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,794
We're preparing to replay the locked room trick

132
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,094
under Mr. Mouri's instructions!

133
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:45,894
Chiba, what is it that you're carrying?

134
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:48,507
Oh, this is

135
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,794
a gigantic poster of the Masked Yaiba movie.

136
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:55,794
I borrowed it from a special effects mania!

137
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,694
Why would you need something like that?

138
00:08:57,694 --> 00:09:00,519
That poster is the same size

139
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,994
as the largest panel of Kira's panel that was over here.

140
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,894
The culprit used this to carry out the locked room trick.

141
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,794
What?

142
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:12,531
Let's start, then.

143
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:16,535
First, you roll that poster into the shape of a cylinder.

144
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:21,094
Then a thin long cylinder of 2m will be made.

145
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,494
Push the cylinder inside the room from the ventilation window

146
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:28,547
and push the tip of it into the cylinder into the drawer.

147
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:32,551
Then all that's left to do is to put the key into that cylinder.

148
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,555
After that, use the tip of the cylinder

149
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:40,094
to place the memo pad on top of the keys,

150
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:43,894
close the drawer then turn the knob.

151
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:46,565
You can lock it.

152
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:51,994
Then the culprit tore up all the posters

153
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,294
and put them inside the room.

154
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:57,694
Lastly, he sends everybody text mail using Shoko's cell phone.

155
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,894
After throwing the cell phone and rope into the room,

156
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:01,794
he left.

157
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:04,583
But, in order to carry out this trick,

158
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,585
wouldn't using just one poster do?

159
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,694
Why did he have to take all the posters that were here out

160
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,294
and rip them?

161
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:14,593
Besides, how did he create the locked room

162
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,794
in this meditation room?

163
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,394
She used magic!

164
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:21,394
Kira became a witch, you know!

165
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:25,894
No, the culprit didn't use magic.

166
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:27,594
Rather, he used a Ninja technique.

167
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,194
Ninja technique?

168
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:32,294
Are you saying that the culprit is a Ninja?

169
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:36,615
I'm not talking about super ninja tricks like

170
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,894
"Dust hiding" and "Ninja split".

171
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:41,394
You see it a lot on TV, don't you?

172
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:44,623
The technique where ninjas jump over high fences

173
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,625
using their own swords.

174
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,629
The culprit used that trick to escape from here.

175
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,094
He used ten somewhat posters

176
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:55,894
that were here in place of a sword!

177
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:58,294
By using the posters?

178
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:00,639
I'm completely lost.

179
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,994
Okay, I'll show you how it was done, everybody!

180
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:07,294
Not again.

181
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,794
You two are my men, you know.

182
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,094
Thanks to the cooperation of Officer Chiba's friend,

183
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:15,394
we were able to get hold of the same size

184
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:18,094
and number of posters that were here.

185
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,394
First, the culprit rolled all the posters

186
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,894
he removed from the panels into cylinders.

187
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:27,594
Posters of the same size are stacked together and rolled up.

188
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:33,294
Then, four cylinders of different lengths will be made.

189
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,694
You bunch the four up

190
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,194
and a make-shift step-ladder is made.

191
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:43,694
But, can you really climb up to that window

192
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,294
using paper that you just rolled up like this?

193
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:49,994
Paper, when you roll it up into cylinders like this

194
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,094
will manifest surprising strength

195
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:55,394
when it comes to vertical loads.

196
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:57,294
Officer Takagi, please.

197
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,494
Yes, sir!

198
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:44,294
But, how will the window be closed after this?

199
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:46,394
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

200
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,394
By using the trick that was used during the seance.

201
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:13,794
When the fishing line is pulled,

202
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,775
the easel ends up pushing the switch right through.

203
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:42,494
Then all he had left to do was go back to Mr. Hirasaka's room

204
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:44,094
get rid of the poster

205
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:46,594
and during the chaos of the dead body being found,

206
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:49,394
return the remote controller into the room.

207
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:50,794
I see.

208
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:54,094
And, who's the culprit?

209
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:57,594
The culprit not only killed Shoko and Mr. Hirasaka,

210
00:13:57,594 --> 00:14:01,694
but also killed Mr. Sawanami who died half a month ago.

211
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:04,823
Characters pointing to the killer was left behind at the scene.

212
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,094
"Kira" was written, right?

213
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,894
Kira resurrected after all.

214
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,794
No!

215
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:13,894
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami

216
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,394
was trying to point out was...

217
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,246
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami

218
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:32,646
was trying to point out was...

219
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:34,346
"Mifune"!

220
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:41,246
Right, the killer is you, Mr. Mifune!

221
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,865
No, it can't be.

222
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,946
Then, what is the meaning of the character "Kira"

223
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,246
that was left back at the scene?

224
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:52,871
Mr. Sawanami

225
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:56,146
tried to write the name "Mifune" in katakana.

226
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,877
But after writing "Mifu", he died.

227
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,646
Shoko, the first one to find the corpse,

228
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,446
saw this and on impulse added on a vertical line

229
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,246
and changed the word to "Kira".

230
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:07,946
What?

231
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:12,346
Ridiculous. Why would she have to do something like that?

232
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:16,146
Wasn't that to protect you?

233
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:19,246
Everything you're saying is nothing but deductions!

234
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,899
Do you have definite proof to support what you're saying?

235
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,903
I'm sure that you still have the proof on you, don't you?

236
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:28,046
-What? -That's why you have your necktie

237
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:29,446
that you usually wear loose,

238
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:30,909
wrapped tightly and neatly around your neck

239
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,911
despite it being hot.

240
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,546
The proof is hidden under that necktie!

241
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:39,446
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

242
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:48,246
When you poisoned Mr. Hirasaka to death,

243
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,929
the wine splattered all over from the glass that was knocked over,

244
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:53,846
and smeared your shirt.

245
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,546
Since you didn't want to get into trouble

246
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:58,046
after the interrogation and your belonging are checked,

247
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:00,939
that you wore it and hid it with your necktie.

248
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,646
If we analyze that smear,

249
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:08,646
it should match the substance that killed Mr. Hirasaka.

250
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,646
Yeah, that's right!

251
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,646
I killed all three of them!

252
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:18,957
Mr. Mifune. Why in the world...

253
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,346
It's because they killed Kira!

254
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,746
The Kira that I love!

255
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:26,965
What? So, you were going out with Kira after all, Mr. Mifune.

256
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,146
Yeah, that's right!

257
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:32,146
That's why despite it being necessary to hide the trick that I used

258
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:35,746
having to tear up Kira's posters with my own hands

259
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,446
was really painful!

260
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:42,046
But, I did so believing that it was to save Kira!

261
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:44,546
To save Kira?

262
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,446
Just as I thought.

263
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:49,246
I thought that it wasn't possible

264
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:50,989
that Kira who was especially careful about driving safely,

265
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,991
would get into an accident in a place like that.

266
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,995
But the police would not take me seriously.

267
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,646
I suspected that something must've happened

268
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:02,746
at the party that was held here.

269
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:05,446
Right before the accident!

270
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:07,646
In order to find out the truth,

271
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:11,009
I set up wiretaps everywhere in this mansion!

272
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,011
I listened to everything!

273
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,346
Hirasaka who was going through a slump back

274
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,346
then drowned himself in alcohol.

275
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:21,546
That night, Hirasaka got drunk and violent again.

276
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:25,657
Kira, who tried to calm him down was knocked down by him

277
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:27,025
and...

278
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,379
In order to hide this fact,

279
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:33,031
Hirasaka and the others faked the accident!

280
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,779
So, you took revenge.

281
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:37,879
Yeah, I picked Sawanami to be the first

282
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,379
because he was the least on his guard.

283
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:41,779
But...

284
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:48,579
I know everything, you know.

285
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,579
Everything that you did, Mr. Mifune.

286
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:53,679
But, don't worry.

287
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,079
I won't tell anybody.

288
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:02,479
Sawanami was saying that another woman as at the party.

289
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:06,379
He didn't say her name, but I knew it was Shoko.

290
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:09,379
He was trying to protect the woman he loved.

291
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,979
I was actually planning to kill you first!

292
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:15,073
Since I knew of the seance from listening to the wiretaps,

293
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,075
I was going to take advantage of it!

294
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,077
But, I changed my mind.

295
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,079
I couldn't forgive the fact that the woman

296
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,479
who was involved in Kira's death dared to blackmailed me!

297
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,879
That's why I decided to kill that woman!

298
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,579
You're wrong!

299
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,379
You're wrong!

300
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:36,279
I'm the one that was with Kira that day!

301
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,779
Maho.

302
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,097
It's a lie.

303
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,879
If so, why didn't Sawanami mention your name?

304
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:47,105
Mr. Sawanami probably didn't know my name.

305
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,107
He didn't seem to be interested in a plain

306
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,679
and reserved person like me.

307
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,979
-No. -It's that true?

308
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,579
Yes.

309
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:59,117
That's why I thought that she was the culprit.

310
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:02,579
Why didn't you report it to the police right away?

311
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,779
I didn't want to believe that Kira was dead!

312
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,129
She was what kept me living.

313
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,679
I was bullied in Junior and Senior high school,

314
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,279
and as an adult I used to be confined to myself.

315
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,139
I owe my being able to function fairly normally to Kira.

316
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,141
I encountered Kira coincidentally at a cosplay shop

317
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:27,479
that I conjured up courage to go to for the first time.

318
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,879
I guess you all think why cosplay.

319
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,151
But, being able to be an inhabitant of dreamland

320
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,153
for even a fleeting moment

321
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:38,279
helped me forget the painful world of reality I lived in.

322
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,879
Kira was the one who taught me that.

323
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:47,165
I wished that everything was just a dream.

324
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,279
If I reported the incident to the police and things came into light,

325
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,679
I would have to accept everything as fact.

326
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,679
I was afraid to do so!

327
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,879
I'm sorry!

328
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,183
Shoko.

329
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:09,479
If only you didn't blackmail Mr. Mifune.

330
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,189
That's wrong too.

331
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:14,279
Shoko liked Mr. Mifune.

332
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,479
What?

333
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:18,379
Wasn't Shoko going steady with Sawanami?

334
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:21,879
No, Shoko told me,

335
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:25,203
"Mr. Mifune probably likes Kira"

336
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:29,479
so she said she'd keep her feelings deep down in her heart.

337
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,779
I think that Shoko

338
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,979
"Mifu" -really wanted to help Mr. Mifune.

339
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:36,379
No.

340
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,217
No.

341
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,579
Which means that I killed somebody

342
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:48,479
who really wanted to protect me with my own hands?

343
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:51,679
There was no sign of her fighting back on her body

344
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,579
because when you attacked her,

345
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,235
she probably felt deep grief and gave up on everything.

346
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,237
That's a lie!

347
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:02,779
A lie!

348
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:05,243
It's a lie! A lie!

349
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:08,979
-Hey! Cut it out! -It's a lie!

350
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:13,251
It's a lie! A lie!

351
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,257
But, why did he have to create a locked room here?

352
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,079
This is just my imagination.

353
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,279
Mr. Mifune, by creating a locked room

354
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,579
probably wanted the police to destroy this room.

355
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,679
Destroyed by the police?

356
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,479
If the locked room trick is not solved,

357
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,779
in order to look for a secret passage or something,

358
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:38,079
the least they'll do is tear off the floors, right?

359
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,979
And, he wanted the police to find

360
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:46,079
Kira's body that Mr. Hirasaka and the others hid under the floor.

361
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,979
He wanted the police, the very ones, who concluded

362
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:51,279
Kira's death to be accidental to find her corpse.

363
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,579
The following day, the police found Kira's body

364
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,479
under the floor of the meditation room.

365
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:04,479
Now, all the locked rooms have been opened.

366
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,579
"Mouri Detective Agency"

367
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,079
Yatsukawa, I heard you won the Director's Award

368
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,389
because of your reporting the incident!

369
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,379
But, many of my acquaintances died

370
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,179
or got arrested,

371
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,179
so my feelings are a bit complex.

372
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,779
Cheer up!

373
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,779
Yes! Please help me out on the next case too!

374
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,403
-What? -My next report'll be about a haunted hospital

375
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:48,579
where a series of ghostly phenomenon occur!

376
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:49,679
What?

377
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,479
Come on! Let's head off right away!

378
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,879
What? Hey! Don't pull me!

379
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:58,479
I'm fed up with occult already.

380
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,479
You can say that again.

381
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,954
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:05,160
"Picture"

383
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,216
Next episode, we will have the woman that's hard to deal with!

384
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:09,427
Oh, mother.

385
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,740
What's this chill I feel?
