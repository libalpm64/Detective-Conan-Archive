1
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,708
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

2
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,008
Saturday nights are for mystery.

3
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:04,708
The urban legend that everyone is concerned about.

4
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,108
Women with long hair, beware.

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,708
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,608
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,051
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:56,838
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 1)".

9
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,175
What's up, Mister?

10
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,177
Are you looking for something?

11
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,638
Hey, hey.

12
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,538
Wait up.

13
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,038
You don't need to run from me.

14
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:45,238
Hey, Ran. Do you know?

15
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:46,638
About Hammer man?

16
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,738
I do! I do!

17
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:50,738
I saw it on the morning news.

18
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:54,213
I hear he appeared in a park near here last night!

19
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,938
Yep, he's said to be tall and over 180 centimeters.

20
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,138
And his targets

21
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,238
all seem to be women with long hair in all four cases.

22
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:05,338
Yes, just like you, Ran.

23
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:06,938
Stop it, Sonoko!

24
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,229
Well, but you would counterattack the Hammer man

25
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,738
with your Karate that you excel in though, Ran!

26
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:14,238
You can never tell

27
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:16,838
if he attacks out of the blue in the dark.

28
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:17,938
Really.

29
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,338
He's a real enemy of women!

30
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,738
I'm sure the police will arrest him in time.

31
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,247
Talk of the devil,

32
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:30,938
there's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato.

33
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,038
Right.

34
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,538
Let's go ask them about

35
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:35,938
how far they've investigated on the Hammer man!

36
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,038
Hold it!

37
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,738
I...

38
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:46,038
I couldn't hear you very well.

39
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,267
Then, let me say it again.

40
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:50,838
Kiss me.

41
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:55,238
Right now. A very passionate one.

42
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:57,238
What? Wait.

43
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:00,538
Come on, quickly!

44
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:02,281
Stop dilly-dallying.

45
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:04,283
Yes!

46
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,738
Then...

47
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,289
excuse me.

48
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:11,838
Stake out?

49
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,638
Right?

50
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,297
You idiot! How dare you intrude on them!

51
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,299
The best was just about to come and yet!

52
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,638
But Officer Sato and Takagi were

53
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,938
glaring at that condo for quite some time with scary looks on their faces.

54
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:29,038
After taking a good look,

55
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,838
I saw the figure of a person from the room on the third floor of that condo

56
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,638
through the curtains,

57
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:36,315
then, I saw Officer Sato suddenly put her arm

58
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,317
around Officer Takagi's neck,

59
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:42,838
so I thought that you suddenly pretended to be lovers

60
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:47,338
so that no one would notice that you were staking out.

61
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:50,038
-Am I wrong? -That's right!

62
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,638
Amazing, you figured it out!

63
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,338
So... so that's what it was.

64
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,038
What did you think it was?

65
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:58,337
Nothing.

66
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,238
If you were staking out, the more I'm sorry

67
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,838
for Conan intruding on you.

68
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:05,338
No problem at all.

69
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:08,138
He rather, helped us.

70
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,438
Helped you?

71
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:13,338
Because it's hard to believe that we're staking out accompanied by

72
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:16,638
girl high school students and an elementary school child, right?

73
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,738
That goes for Hammer man too.

74
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,238
Hammer man?

75
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:24,938
Didn't you see it on the news?

76
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:28,738
That Hammer man was witnessed somewhere near here last night.

77
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:29,938
Oh, yes.

78
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:31,438
On TV this morning.

79
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,373
The fact is that witness...

80
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,338
went after Hammer man after seeing him.

81
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:57,138
And he saw Hammer man goes into this condo.

82
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:02,838
We got a report of this and came here right away, you see.

83
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,938
We checked each room

84
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,638
and found that almost all the residents have an alibi.

85
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:10,038
And the only room with someone although apparently inside,

86
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,413
that we got no answer from, despite ringing the doorbell

87
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:18,838
was the room in the center on the third floor over there!

88
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,538
Then, why don't you just raid the room

89
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,338
after getting the spare key from the landlord?

90
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:26,738
We can't, we don't have a warrant.

91
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,838
But is the person in the room

92
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:30,838
really the Hammer man?

93
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:34,738
Maybe he just imitated the Hammer man and...

94
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,838
He's no imitator.

95
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:40,838
That man was called by the witness and...

96
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,449
What's up, Mister?

97
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,138
Are you looking for something?

98
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:58,038
He forgot the blood-smeared hammer

99
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,038
when he rushed to flee.

100
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:02,838
The same hammer that also had

101
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,538
the blood of the victims of the three previous cases too!

102
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:08,938
But it's amazing how that eye-witness caught up with the culprit.

103
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,438
Yeah, being that the Hammer man is said

104
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:14,738
to run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

105
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,738
That's just urban legend!

106
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:19,538
I've heard that he's actually not that fast.

107
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,938
Because after all,

108
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,238
that man is said to have been able to pursue the Hammer man

109
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,138
despite being drunk

110
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,638
But if you know where his room is,

111
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,938
you can also tell who lives there, right?

112
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:31,338
The thing is,

113
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:32,838
the person who lives in that room

114
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:36,238
is a backpacker who is currently travelling abroad.

115
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:40,138
The parents of the resident of that room said on the phone

116
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:43,038
that their son would be lending the room to a friend of his for a while.

117
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,138
You don't know who that man is?

118
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,509
Well, according to his next-door neighbor,

119
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,538
he seems to have been living there together with his girlfriend previously,

120
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:57,638
but it seems that his girlfriend recently hasn't been coming around,

121
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:02,538
and the only time he is seen going out is at night.

122
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,338
He seems to always be wearing a cap or hood.

123
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:08,138
It seems he doesn't clearly remember what the man looks like though.

124
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:09,638
Officer Sato and Takagi.

125
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:12,838
Officer Chiba.

126
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:17,938
What? You used to go to that room?

127
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,138
Who are they?

128
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:24,138
Well, we were staking the entrance of the condo from some distance

129
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:28,538
and saw these three go into and come out of the room in question.

130
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,838
They went in one after the other at ten-minute intervals.

131
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,938
You already told Inspector Megure about them, didn't you?

132
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:34,938
Yes, Ma'am.

133
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:38,557
And what were the three doing in the room?

134
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,538
Doing what?

135
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,561
I just went to pick up the package that I was told to come

136
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,438
and get on the phone.

137
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,138
I came to pick up a package

138
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:51,038
that I was told to come get by motorbike too.

139
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:54,573
I came to deliver pizza.

140
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:59,038
Then, did all three of you see the resident of the room?

141
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:02,038
No, I didn't see him.

142
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:05,138
There was a piece of paper posted below the entrance.

143
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,038
It said that he was in bed with a cold,

144
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:12,138
so to just come in and take the cardboard box that was on the table.

145
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,938
The voucher was written

146
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:18,597
and the money was in an envelope on the box.

147
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,838
I see. What about you?

148
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:24,138
I didn't see him either.

149
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:25,138
Instructions for what I should do

150
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:28,138
was also written on the paper by the entrance.

151
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:33,938
It said that I was to take the bag that is on the table.

152
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:36,338
I got the address where I was to deliver the item

153
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:37,938
at the time he gave us a call.

154
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:42,621
The pizza delivery was also written on that paper.

155
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,038
It said the payment for the pizza

156
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:46,938
is inside the envelope on the table, so to take it.

157
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,629
And to leave the pizza on the table.

158
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,338
I'm pretty sure that's what was written.

159
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,633
In bed with a cold?

160
00:10:54,838 --> 00:11:00,338
Yeah, the voice I heard when he called was hoarse.

161
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,638
Same here.

162
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,138
Me too.

163
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:06,938
But I wonder why he called people one after the other to his room.

164
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,438
There were two others besides you

165
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:12,138
who were staking the entrance, weren't there?

166
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,653
Yes, the other two officers

167
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,238
went to stop the courier and the motorbike courier.

168
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:20,038
I stopped the pizza delivery man who arrived last.

169
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:24,038
You mean that there are no officers watching the entrance now?

170
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,938
Officer Chiba! Take care of them, will you?

171
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,238
Okay.

172
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,438
The more people he calls over to the room,

173
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:37,038
each time the police has no choice but to stop the person

174
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:39,238
and ask him what he came to the condo for!

175
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,238
Moreover, if the officer who goes after the person

176
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:45,138
is the one who actually saw that person, it would be perfect!

177
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,338
He schemed to flee

178
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,038
while he used his strategy to decrease the number of officers

179
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,138
who were staking out the condo!

180
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:55,538
A memo in front of the door.

181
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,707
The pizza is untouched.

182
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,638
He ordered the pizza in order to flee after all.

183
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:14,738
Officer Sato.

184
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:18,238
Right after Officer Chiba went after the pizza delivery man to stop him,

185
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,138
the officer that went to stop

186
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,438
the first delivery person that came, also returned,

187
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:24,723
and took over watching in Officer Chiba's place,

188
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,938
but says that no one left the room.

189
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,138
It can't be.

190
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:31,938
Then, it means that Hammer man is still inside the room.

191
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:35,238
Could it be that he's waiting to ambush us?

192
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,538
No.

193
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:39,338
I don't think he had any intention

194
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,038
to ambush anybody.

195
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:46,745
Suicide?

196
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:49,638
It seems that he's still breathing, though.

197
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,438
Officer Takagi, get an ambulance!

198
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,751
Yes!

199
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,038
I see.

200
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:56,755
He had prepared a coat and hat

201
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,538
so that he could flee,

202
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,938
but after figuring that he couldn't possibly flee,

203
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,338
he decided to kill himself.

204
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:07,638
But before he could complete what he set off to do,

205
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,138
the rope came off

206
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:12,038
and he fell to the floor passed out.

207
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:13,738
I don't think he committed suicide.

208
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,538
See, look at his neck.

209
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,238
There's practically no trace of the rope around his neck.

210
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,438
You... you're right.

211
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,438
Besides, his hat.

212
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,787
I don't think that a person who has his mind set on committing suicide

213
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,038
would wear a hat

214
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:33,538
that would get in the way of putting the rope around his neck.

215
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,938
Then, why the hat?

216
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,738
This... this is...

217
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,138
Just what does this mean?

218
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:48,038
Hammer man was struck

219
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:52,438
by one of the three people who came to this room!

220
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:04,823
Officer Chiba?

221
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,048
Just a while ago, there were three people

222
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,827
who went in and out of Hammer man's room, weren't there?

223
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,148
Yes.

224
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:12,848
Will you please bring those three here?

225
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,833
I have something I want to ask them.

226
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,837
But since all three of them seemed busy,

227
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:22,648
and asked to be interrogated after work,

228
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,843
I let them go just a while ago.

229
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,148
What?

230
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:29,848
Hey, hey.

231
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,848
Then, what you are saying is

232
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:37,948
while you were staking out Hammer man's room,

233
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:40,859
three people went in and out of the room.

234
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,248
You thought that Hammer man summoned these three people

235
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:46,865
to use them as a strategy to help Hammer man flee,

236
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,867
and busted into this room,

237
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,348
but you ended up finding Hammer man on the floor

238
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,871
after being struck by someone,

239
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,448
unconscious and in critical condition.

240
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,148
Judging from the circumstances,

241
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:00,448
the one who struck him has to be one of the three.

242
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:03,648
But since you never imagined this to be happening,

243
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:07,748
you very politely let the three go home.

244
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,748
Am I correct?

245
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,548
-Yes. -Yes.

246
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:14,148
-Well... -You...

247
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,148
idiots!

248
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,648
Just how many years have you been working as police detectives?

249
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,748
We have no word of apology for our carelessness...

250
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:28,148
And? What were the characters of the three people?

251
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:30,909
Yes. Well...

252
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,911
They were a courier,

253
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,448
a motorbike delivery person,

254
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,248
and a pizza delivery man.

255
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,048
Conan?

256
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:41,248
Well, we just happened to run into him.

257
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:42,921
I'm pretty sure that

258
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:47,948
the courier was a tall man who was more than 180 centimeters.

259
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,448
The motorbike person was

260
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,931
a woman, a small person less than 160 centimeters.

261
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:54,933
And the pizza delivery man

262
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:58,348
was a thin person about 170 centimeters tall.

263
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:02,348
Conan is a lot more dependable than all of you.

264
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:04,943
Like always.

265
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,048
Right?

266
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:10,949
But why on earth did the culprit strike Hammer man?

267
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,248
It's most likely

268
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:15,348
that a person connected to one of the victims of the four assault cases

269
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,948
committed by Hammer man

270
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:20,448
held a grudge against him and did it.

271
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,648
Although no one has died yet,

272
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,048
all four victims were inflicted serious injuries.

273
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,348
In other words,

274
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,348
the culprit found out through the news

275
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:30,969
that an incident occurred in this vicinity,

276
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,248
and set his target on this condo where he witnessed officers

277
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:35,348
that seemed to be staking out,

278
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,975
disguised himself as someone

279
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,548
who wouldn't be suspected of going in and out of the room,

280
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,348
and struck Hammer man.

281
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,348
That's the story.

282
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:46,985
But why'd you let them go without even asking for their names?

283
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
Oh, well...

284
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:51,848
because all three said that they left invoices in the room,

285
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,948
with their names as well as their company names on them,

286
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,848
if they needed to be contacted.

287
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,348
The only invoice found was that of the pizza shop.

288
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,048
What? No joke.

289
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,448
Hey, Chiba.

290
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:07,348
But we have the invoice from the pizza shop,

291
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:09,007
so we could

292
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,148
call the shop and find out if he's the culprit or not.

293
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,748
Huh? He hasn't returned?

294
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,017
You mean the person who went out to make the delivery

295
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,648
hasn't come back yet?

296
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:24,148
No, he left about 40 minutes ago

297
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:27,648
after receiving a phone order from that condo.

298
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:30,748
It's already about time that he should be back.

299
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:33,648
Did something happen to our part-time worker, officer?

300
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,448
Oh, no.

301
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:38,048
If so, it could be that

302
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:41,039
the culprit pretended to be the resident of the room,

303
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,041
and placed an order for pizza delivery,

304
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:46,748
kidnapped the delivery person who came along,

305
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,448
took the clothes off the delivery man

306
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,248
and in turn disguised himself as the delivery man

307
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:53,848
and broke into this room?

308
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:55,648
If so,

309
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:59,048
did the courier and motorbike delivery just happen to come by?

310
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:01,848
It could've been camouflage.

311
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,063
Just the pizza delivery man coming would be too conspicuous.

312
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,248
Besides, all three said

313
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:10,348
that the voice of the man on the line was hoarse.

314
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,348
It could be that the culprit did so deliberately

315
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,748
because he didn't want his voice to be identified.

316
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,348
The pizza delivery man who arrived there last

317
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:19,748
could've crumpled the invoices of the courier and the motorbike delivery

318
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,348
that came after him.

319
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:24,548
But isn't it strange?

320
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:28,348
Because when the first courier came,

321
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,948
there was a note in front of the door that said,

322
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:35,748
"I'm in bed with a cold, so go ahead and do what you have to".

323
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,095
So, he went ahead into the room, just as was written

324
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,648
and took the parcel with him, right?

325
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,448
If the pizza delivery man came last,

326
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:45,103
I don't think he could've put the note there.

327
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,748
True,

328
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:47,748
the only one who could've put it there,

329
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:50,548
would've been the courier who got there first.

330
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,648
In other words, the culprit didn't come to get the parcel,

331
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:55,113
but rather, feigned to have come to make a delivery,

332
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,448
forced himself into the room,

333
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:59,848
knocked Hammer man down,

334
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,119
and when leaving the room,

335
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,348
left that note behind to lure the motorbike delivery person

336
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:07,148
and pizza delivery man into the room.

337
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:10,348
And set it up so that he alone wouldn't be suspected.

338
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,131
But if so, the invoice of the motorbike person

339
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,548
should've been found in the room.

340
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,137
The ones who can hide the invoices of the courier

341
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,139
and the motorbike delivery person

342
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,448
are either the motorbike delivery person or the pizza delivery man, so...

343
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:27,448
But if the pizza delivery man is the culprit,

344
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,448
why did he leave his own invoice behind?

345
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,448
The one who can get rid of the invoice for the pizza that came last

346
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:35,148
is the man who delivered the pizza,

347
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,748
so maybe he deliberately left it behind.

348
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:39,148
I see.

349
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:43,161
Which of the three is the culprit?

350
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,648
At any rate,

351
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:51,948
let's leave looking for the three to the other officers,

352
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,248
and investigate this room!

353
00:19:55,648 --> 00:20:00,848
You haven't found any definite evidence yet that Hammer man

354
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,448
is really a resident of this room, have you?

355
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,548
True.

356
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:08,148
Okay! Search each nook and cranny!

357
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,548
-Yes, Sir! -Yes, Sir!

358
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,848
Say, Officer Takagi.

359
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,148
-Did you find anything? -No.

360
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:22,548
Not anything worth mentioning.

361
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:27,205
Only that this toilet and bathtub were used very cleanly.

362
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,207
Don't you think it's too clean?

363
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:32,748
Because, see, take a look.

364
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,848
The dining room is quite messy,

365
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:39,217
and yet the toilet and bathtub being spic-and-span is strange.

366
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:43,221
Besides, the electric shaver that is on the washbasin...

367
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,223
Electric shaver?

368
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:49,227
Although it's the chargeable kind, it's not plugged in.

369
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,248
It's strange that although there is a shampoo bottle, soap and toothpaste,

370
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:55,248
there is no toothbrush.

371
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,235
True.

372
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,748
Something's really not right.

373
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:02,248
Something's really strange after all!

374
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,648
Because the drain of the bathtub...

375
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:09,247
There is no hair or anything else stuck inside!

376
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,448
No way!

377
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:11,648
Really?

378
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,348
I... I'm sorry.

379
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:28,648
I seemed to have tripped.

380
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:30,248
Oh, no.

381
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,648
Excuse me.

382
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:42,748
The drain, was it?

383
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:43,948
Let's see.

384
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,287
It's strange after all.

385
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:52,348
Why has only the bathroom been cleaned thoroughly?

386
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,948
Kiss me.

387
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:02,848
Right now. A very passionate one.

388
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:04,248
Come on, quickly!

389
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:05,748
Stop dilly-dallying.

390
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,348
Inspector Megure!

391
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,148
We found gloves with blood on them!

392
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,648
Where'd you find it?

393
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,317
Over here!

394
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:22,048
When we checked inside the dryer and washing machine,

395
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:25,648
we found these gloves among the laundry.

396
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:31,648
Is the man who was found lying on the floor of this room Hammer man?

397
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:36,048
And is one of the three people who came to this room,

398
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,948
the one who attacked Hammer man?

399
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,423
"Shift pad".

401
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,425
This time for sure, I'm going to make it with Ms. Sato.

402
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,110
Please don't get in my way, okay, Conan?

403
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,840
I wonder about that.
