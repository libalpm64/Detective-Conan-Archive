1
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:04,122
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:06,122
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:07,522
Is it a prank played by the god of matchmaking?

4
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:09,122
Conan challenges the mystery of a murder.

5
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:10,922
That is analogous to the story of the "Eight-Forked Serpent".

6
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,422
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,222
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,222
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,218
So...

10
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:04,818
I'm going to check out the famous sightseeing spots

11
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:07,618
and drink up the "all-you-can-drink"!

12
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:12,918
He's 180 degrees unlike what he was in the plane.

13
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,918
The place we came to visit this time

14
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:22,318
is the home of mythology, Izumo.

15
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:29,418
"The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 1)"

16
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,718
Izumo Shrine is where the God for matchmaking is enshrined.

17
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,718
I can understand Ran praying with passion, but...

18
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:40,118
Please, please do find me a good match.

19
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,818
Gosh. I wonder what kind of match he is expecting.

20
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:45,618
I'll tie mine here.

21
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:51,018
For a good match, a good match!

22
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,618
Gosh.

23
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:55,518
So this is Japan's greatest "Ooshimenawa".

24
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,918
It sure is huge!

25
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:00,218
Well, this is fantastic.

26
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,118
It weighs five tons.

27
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:05,718
Five tons?

28
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,418
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

29
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,518
The famed detective.

30
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:11,418
Yes.

31
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:15,418
You look way better in person than on television.

32
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:20,418
Do you work here?

33
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,718
"Eiko Esumi (25)" -I'm Eiko Esumi.

34
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:25,618
I run a Japanese inn in front of the path to this shrine.

35
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,418
A Japanese inn?

36
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:31,018
I'm his daughter, Ran. And he's Conan.

37
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,518
Hello.

38
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:36,518
Excuse me, what's that money there?

39
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:37,618
Really!

40
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,718
There's so much money stuck to it.

41
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:41,918
I guess you can call it a tradition?

42
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:44,218
If the coin gets stuck on it, they say your wish is granted.

43
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,818
Which means, I'll meet the person of my dreams?

44
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:51,718
There! Go for it!

45
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:56,818
Darn it.

46
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,018
There!

47
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,518
Darn you!

48
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,918
Darn it!

49
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:07,718
Your wish will probably never be granted.

50
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:12,418
How lucky to have a hometown in a place where the God of matchmaking is.

51
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,818
I have a tentative offer for marriage, too.

52
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:18,218
Tentative?

53
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,218
What?

54
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:23,218
Is it with someone you don't really care for?

55
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:26,618
I get it! That man is poor.

56
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,718
I think he has money.

57
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:31,018
Because he's involved in large-scale business.

58
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:34,018
Maybe he has a bad personality.

59
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:38,018
A rich man with bad personality is the worst match in any category.

60
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,618
You should call off the marriage.

61
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,118
Dad!

62
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:46,018
But I have a reason for not being able to refuse.

63
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,418
When you get married,

64
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:50,118
it should be with someone that you really love, right?

65
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:52,918
What is the name of that man?

66
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,118
Mr. Koji Wanibuchi.

67
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:58,218
No matter what reasons you may have,

68
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:01,018
reluctantly getting married with Mr. Wanibuchi

69
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,018
is like giving yourself up as human sacrifice.

70
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,618
Dad!

71
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,418
I'm sorry for what he said.

72
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:11,118
Don't be. Because Mr. Mouri is saying this for me.

73
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,518
Right, Conan?

74
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:16,218
Shall we go see an interesting miniature model?

75
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,515
An interesting miniature model?

76
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:21,715
Did Izumo Shrine look like this before?

77
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:23,515
This is indeed...

78
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,415
The world of mythology!

79
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:28,615
This seems to be the biggest shrine in all of Japan.

80
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,815
I'm not sure of the details.

81
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,315
It is a shrine that was built towards the end of the Heian Period

82
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,315
to the first part of the Kamakura Period.

83
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,515
Ryo!

84
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,615
Sorry, can you wait a while?

85
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:40,615
Yep.

86
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,515
He's Ryosuke Fukama, a childhood friend of mine.

87
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:46,215
He used to like ancient history since he was a child.

88
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:49,715
"Ryosuke Fukama (25)" -He's lucky because he's working doing what he likes.

89
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:54,615
Eiko actually likes Mr. Fukuma.

90
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:57,215
Yep. I'm sure he likes her, too.

91
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:02,815
How exasperating.

92
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:03,915
All three pillars were created

93
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,215
by bunching three huge trees together as one...

94
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:09,815
Eiko is going to be taken away by a rich guy with bad personality

95
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:14,115
because you don't keep a firm grip on her!

96
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:15,315
Yes?

97
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:16,515
Mr. Mouri.

98
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,115
Dad!

99
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:20,515
I'm really sorry.

100
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:22,815
No, it's okay.

101
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,515
Mr. Mouri. Thank you for today.

102
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,615
Not at all. Get a grip of yourself, okay?

103
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,615
You seem to be saying good stuff,

104
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,015
but who knows what's actually on your mind.

105
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:36,015
The following day, murder is committed.

106
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,615
A current price of 10,000,000 yen?

107
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,515
That does it.

108
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:57,115
Stabbed right in the back.

109
00:06:57,115 --> 00:07:00,415
Don't let outsiders in here!

110
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:02,315
Don't tell me that you're...

111
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:06,315
I'm Mouri, a private detective from Tokyo.

112
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:07,615
Just as I thought!

113
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:09,315
I've heard of your activities.

114
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:11,115
I'm Officer Yamane of the Izumo Police Department.

115
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,615
Likewise, I'm Officer Komura.

116
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,015
It's amazing how you got here.

117
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:17,515
I just happened to be nearby.

118
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,315
However, there seems to be no need for the assistance

119
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,315
of a famed detective for this case.

120
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,215
How's that?

121
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:29,915
The victim is Mr. Koji Wanibuchi, the owner of Wanibuchi Sogyo,

122
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:34,315
that is doing extensive business centering around the Izumo area, age 35.

123
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:37,115
Koji Wanibuchi?

124
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:40,015
The fiance that Eiko was talking about yesterday?

125
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:42,415
He was killed.

126
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,215
So you know him.

127
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:46,515
He is a famous businessman that is well-known locally,

128
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,115
as being a wheeler-dealer.

129
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:50,615
The person who found him is that couple over there.

130
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,015
They're locals.

131
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,915
Well, this is not a place that tourists would come.

132
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:59,915
The estimated time of death is around 13:00.

133
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:03,615
Mr. Wanibuchi's watch is thought to have broken when he fell.

134
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:06,015
It is stopped at 13:05.

135
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:09,615
It's probably okay to determine that it was time the murder was committed.

136
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,315
The motive of the killing was probably due to grudge.

137
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,115
Being a wheeler-dealer businessman,

138
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,015
he must've had a lot of enemies, too.

139
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:19,215
He seems to have had a bad personality, too.

140
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:22,415
It's true that he didn't have a good reputation,

141
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,915
but the purpose of the killer

142
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:27,315
was to steal his sword that is worth 10,000,000 yen.

143
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,915
A sword priced at 10,000,000 yen?

144
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:33,115
This is Mr. Wanibuchi's notebook.

145
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:37,515
He was scheduled to go to a local antique shop today

146
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:41,415
and get the sword as collateral for lending money this afternoon.

147
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:44,515
I confirmed with the shop and found that at around 12:00 noon,

148
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:46,415
they gave the sword to Mr. Wanibuchi as promised.

149
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:52,015
After receiving the sword, Mr. Wanibuchi came here to Inome.

150
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,315
And we're not sure for what, but at around before 13:00,

151
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:58,915
he was witnessed standing holding the sword.

152
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,215
However, when his body was found,

153
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:03,415
the sword was nowhere in sight.

154
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:07,515
The killer who saw him receive the sword at the antique shop

155
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,515
may have tailed Mr. Wanibuchi and...

156
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:22,215
So you see, this is a simple case of robbing treasure.

157
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:25,215
So there is no need for a detective.

158
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,115
Yes, now I clearly understand.

159
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:33,315
I wonder if this case is really all that simple?

160
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,615
Why come out all the way to a place like this?

161
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:38,715
Moreover, bringing a sword worth 10,000,000 yen along?

162
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,615
What are you thinking about?

163
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,415
I'm not thinking anything!

164
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:47,815
I hate to say this about the late Mr. Wanibuchi,

165
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:51,815
but Eiko won't have to get married reluctantly anymore.

166
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:55,915
-Ran! -I know that I shouldn't be saying this.

167
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:58,515
But you were saying so yourself yesterday, too.

168
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,915
That it's like human sacrifice.

169
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,115
Well, you see, that was...

170
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:05,615
Wait. This case sounds similar

171
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,915
to the story of getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent, doesn't it?

172
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,215
Getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent?

173
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:12,915
The mythology of Susano-o-no-mikoto.

174
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,615
There was an unfortunate princess

175
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,015
that was about to be taken away against her will,

176
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:20,715
when Susano-o appears to save her.

177
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,015
Thanks to Susano-o for getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent,

178
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,415
the princess is rescued.

179
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,215
And Susano-o gets a hold of the Eight-forked serpent's sword.

180
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:29,915
It sure is similar.

181
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:32,215
Right?

182
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,015
Susano-o-no-mikoto may be a hero,

183
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,215
but the killer is nothing close to it!

184
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:41,415
It just so happened to help Eiko out,

185
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:44,015
but the guy is a robber!

186
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,515
I know that.

187
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,115
All I'm saying is that it seems similar to the mythology

188
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,615
about getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent.

189
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,015
Right, Conan?

190
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:54,515
Yeah.

191
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:58,515
This case was not just a simple robbery after all.

192
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:10,415
Once a year, when the Gods from all over Japan gather at Izumo,

193
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:13,615
it is said that they land here on Inasanohama.

194
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:16,215
What? They're not listening.

195
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,715
I'm explaining this to you.

196
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:20,215
I wonder if something happened?

197
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,215
Don't tell me that this is...

198
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,215
I confirmed it with the antique shop owner

199
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:36,015
and was told that it was indeed the sword in question.

200
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,415
Just as I thought.

201
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:38,515
I don't understand.

202
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,615
Why would you hide the treasure

203
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,815
so that it get covered with sand like this?

204
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,915
It was probably thrown away, not hidden,

205
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:47,415
because whoever it was didn't need it anymore.

206
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,915
Taking the sword away from the site of the murder was a camouflage

207
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:54,915
to deceive people into thinking it was a robbery.

208
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,615
It's most likely

209
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:01,115
that the real motive of the culprit was to take Mr. Wanibuchi's life.

210
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:04,915
The real motive is most probably a grudge.

211
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,715
Get a list on the double of his business rivals

212
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:10,915
as well as all the people in Mr. Wanibuchi's private life

213
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:12,715
that he was having problems with.

214
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,815
Yes, sir!

215
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:15,815
What is it?

216
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,615
Oh, no.

217
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:22,715
After the list was made,

218
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:25,615
the following day, four people were called in by the police.

219
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:31,515
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma were also among the people who were summoned.

220
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,389
I will be questioning everyone by turn.

221
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:40,389
But before that,

222
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:44,589
I would like to introduce someone who will be helping us with this case.

223
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,089
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

224
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,389
I'm Mouri.

225
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,789
That famed detective?

226
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,189
"Takehiko Fujie (40)" -Well, I didn't think that a famed detective

227
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,689
would be in Izumo.

228
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,789
First of all, Mr. Kazuya Ishitobi.

229
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:03,989
Yes, sir.

230
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,289
According to our investigation,

231
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:09,889
"Kazuya Ishitobi (35)" -Mr. Wanibuchi approached your shop of long standing

232
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,589
asking if you'd like to joint-manage the shop with him, is that right?

233
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:15,589
Joint management, my foot!

234
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,689
Wanibuchi Sogyo will take care of all the management finances.

235
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:22,589
All you have to do is lend me the name Ishitobi,

236
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,889
and we'll open stores throughout Japan.

237
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,689
Fantastic, don't you think?

238
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:31,089
You're not thinking of refusing, are you?

239
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,789
He tried to take over "Ishitobi"

240
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,889
that had been in business for 2,000 years by threat and money!

241
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,489
I see.

242
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:42,089
Next, Mr. Takehiko Fujie.

243
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,789
You run a wedding hall called Ryounkaku and...

244
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:49,189
The same went for my place as Mr. Ishitobi just mentioned.

245
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:52,289
We at Wanibuchi Sogyo are thinking of going into

246
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,189
the wedding hall management business.

247
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,189
What?

248
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,289
But I do not want to fight for customers

249
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:59,989
with Ryounkaku that is a place of long standing.

250
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,789
So I would like to make a proposal.

251
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,289
We would like to invest our capital in your company

252
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:07,189
and would like to carry out joint-management with you.

253
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:08,389
What do you think?

254
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,689
Mr. Fujie, my superior?

255
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:16,789
He wanted to take over.

256
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,689
Superior?

257
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,489
Wanibuchi was an underclassman of mine

258
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,889
of Teito University economics department in Tokyo.

259
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,189
I see. At the university.

260
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:29,589
His name means crocodile, but his character is like that of a snake.

261
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,689
A monster that swallows up anything he targets as prey.

262
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:35,289
Yes, he's just like the Eight-forked serpent.

263
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,489
I see.

264
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:43,289
Ms. Eiko Esumi, you also had business connections with Mr. Wanibuchi?

265
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,389
Yes, sir.

266
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,389
Our inn, Hinodeya, is also an inn of long standing,

267
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,389
but wear and tear kept getting worse.

268
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,789
But we couldn't afford to renovate it.

269
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:55,089
At about that time, we were contacted by a company in Tokyo

270
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,289
saying that they'd like to build a modern hotel in its place,

271
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:00,089
so they would like us to sell them our land.

272
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,289
Just when my parents were thinking,

273
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,189
there was no other choice than to let go of the inn.

274
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,789
It's absurd that an inn with such long standing

275
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,189
as Hinodeya go out of business.

276
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:11,689
Let us help you with the renovation fees.

277
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,889
For the sake of Izumo.

278
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,389
It was unexpected.

279
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,889
Because from what I heard of him, he was a greedy man and nothing else.

280
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:21,489
My parents accepted his offer thankfully

281
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:24,689
and renovated the inn, but...

282
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,089
Let my daughter marry you?

283
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,089
What's come over you all of a sudden?

284
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,289
It's not all of a sudden.

285
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,489
I lent you the money for renovation

286
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,789
because this is the birth home of my future wife.

287
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:37,889
For what other reason would anybody do this?

288
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,089
He was planning on it to begin with.

289
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,589
He said to give the total of the money he lent back right away,

290
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,489
if I refuse to marry him.

291
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:47,289
Oh, no.

292
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,289
My parents told me that if they have to give me up to a guy like that,

293
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,889
they'd rather let go of the inn.

294
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,689
But I know how much that inn

295
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:59,589
that has been handed down for generations mean to them.

296
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:00,989
That's why I...

297
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:02,489
Mr. Fukuma.

298
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:04,789
Not being able to leave Ms. Esumi in her plight,

299
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,089
you went time and again to ask Mr. Wanibuchi

300
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,989
to let her go, didn't you?

301
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,389
I hated him.

302
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,589
I hated that man, too.

303
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,989
Next, at the time that Mr. Wanibuchi was murdered,

304
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:28,589
please tell me where and what each of you were doing

305
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,289
at around 13:00 yesterday.

306
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,789
First of all...

307
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:34,289
I was at Matsue Castle!

308
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,189
Matsue Castle?

309
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,889
I was alone so I have no one to prove it.

310
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,589
That's right. I signed my name on the list of the castle tower.

311
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,689
Mr. Fukuma.

312
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:50,689
It was my day off yesterday,

313
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,589
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

314
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:57,289
I was there from a little before noon to about 3:00.

315
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,889
I go there often, because I can relax there.

316
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,989
But I was alone too, so there are no witnesses to prove it.

317
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,989
Then Mr. Ishitobi.

318
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:10,289
I was at the Izumo Traditional Culture Museum.

319
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,489
I was alone, too.

320
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:16,089
Lastly, Ms. Esumi?

321
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,389
I was at Hinomisaki.

322
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,689
I was alone, too.

323
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,689
It was a little too early for seagulls

324
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,289
that I didn't get to see them.

325
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,189
Komura, split up and check on the alibis.

326
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:31,189
Yes, sir.

327
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,589
They're all famous sightseeing spots,

328
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,889
so many people must've seen them.

329
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:42,089
That is, if they're telling the truth.

330
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,789
Exactly.

331
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:48,689
How was it?

332
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:49,789
Yes, sir.

333
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,389
Mr. Fujie's alibi's been confirmed.

334
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:54,189
It was written in his handwriting

335
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,089
and judging from the names written by the people there,

336
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,789
it is thought that he was certainly in Matsue at 13:05.

337
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,489
13:05.

338
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:04,389
He wrote his name on the list at the very time

339
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,389
the victim was killed.

340
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:09,789
The time it takes to get from Matsue Castle

341
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,989
to Inome, the scene of the crime

342
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,089
is about 40 minutes to an hour by car.

343
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,489
I see.

344
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,089
So I'm not a suspect anymore.

345
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,989
The problem is the remaining three of you.

346
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,289
We cannot get any eyewitnesses at all.

347
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,689
Not even one?

348
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,189
Not even one, for all three of them.

349
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:34,389
But we can't keep you here just because we can't confirm your alibis.

350
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,889
You may have to come in for questioning again,

351
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,189
but you may go for today.

352
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,689
Thank you for your cooperation.

353
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,889
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the ones, are they?

354
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:50,289
No.

355
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,489
I wonder why there are no witnesses whatsoever.

356
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:55,389
Could it be that they're lying?

357
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,389
Yes, this is Yamane.

358
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,089
Yes. Yes.

359
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,689
What?

360
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,089
I see. Okay!

361
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,389
Call him back!

362
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:10,989
Ryosuke Fukuma!

363
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,789
Yes, sir!

364
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:14,989
Yesterday at around 14:00,

365
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:17,489
we found a witness that said he saw someone

366
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,889
burying something at Inasanohama.

367
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,589
The man who was witnessed was a tall, lanky man.

368
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:29,189
Sand from Inasanohama

369
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,989
and soil from Inome Cave were detected from your shoes.

370
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,489
You did it, didn't you?

371
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:35,889
You killed Mr. Wanibuchi, didn't you?

372
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:38,789
I stand mute.

373
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,089
He's exercising his right to remain silent?

374
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,789
Yes. But if he's the one who did it,

375
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,789
that explains why there were no witnesses at Old Taisha Station.

376
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,389
Because he had killed Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome

377
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:55,089
and got rid of the sword at Inasanohama.

378
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:58,189
I guess he's the one, Ryosuke Fukuma.

379
00:19:58,189 --> 00:19:59,589
Oh, no!

380
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,789
Since the sand and soil were found on his shoes,

381
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,889
as well as a witness having seen him,

382
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:06,889
he probably did take the sword away from the site,

383
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,789
and buried it at the beach.

384
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,589
But it's not enough to conclude that he's the one who killed the victim.

385
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,389
I was at Hinomisaki.

386
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,389
That reaction.

387
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:25,089
Mr. Fukuma knew where Eiko really was at that time.

388
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,689
Which means...

389
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:30,389
Hey, where do you think you're going?

390
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:36,789
You brat.

391
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,089
Why did you go into the interrogation room on your own?

392
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:40,789
No, Conan!

393
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,789
Because I think

394
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,789
that Mr. Fukuma isn't saying anything

395
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,989
because he's protecting the real killer.

396
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,889
Just as I thought.

397
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:53,489
I'm right.

398
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:58,989
He probably saw the real killer killed Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome Cave.

399
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:02,889
But I wonder who that real killer is?

400
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,089
Who else would he have to protect other than that one person?

401
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:10,089
You witnessed Ms. Eiko Esumi commit the murder.

402
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:13,889
That's why you took the sword away to make it look like a robbery.

403
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,689
Is that it?

404
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:18,789
I did it! I'm the one who killed Wanibuchi!

405
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,089
It's too late saying it now.

406
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,389
Me?

407
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,889
It's not me!

408
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,089
Then at the time Mr. Wanibuchi was murdered,

409
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,889
where were you really at?

410
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,189
You said you were at Hinomisaki, but nobody saw you there.

411
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:38,589
The lighthouse worker nor the souvenir shop employee, nobody!

412
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,989
Well...

413
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:42,589
She's doing the same thing as Mr. Fukuma.

414
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,989
She sounds like she's protecting somebody.

415
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:48,089
It was my day off yesterday,

416
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,389
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

417
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:51,789
It could be that...

418
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:56,289
I'll bet you're protecting Mr. Fukuma

419
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:57,989
because you know that he's the killer?

420
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,489
I was right after all.

421
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,089
Hey!

422
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,089
Ran, come with me!

423
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:13,889
Conan, what are you doing?

424
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,089
What is going on, Mr. Mouri?

425
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:20,089
The lovers are protecting each other.

426
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:23,889
Which of you is the killer?

427
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,689
Neither of them may be the killer?

428
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:28,289
We're going to prove that!

429
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,489
And where to?

430
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,389
To Old Taisha Station.

431
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:34,257
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:36,257
"False testimony"

433
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,657
-Did you pray to get together with Shinichi? -No.

434
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:39,957
Then who did you pray to get together with?

435
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,057
Tell me!
