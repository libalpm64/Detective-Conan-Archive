1
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:05,161
Rena Mizunashi, is the only clue we have to closing in

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,561
on the Black Organization.

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,861
Eisuke Hondo, who has an older sister that looks exactly like her,

4
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:11,991
is on the search for her and his whereabouts become unknown.

5
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,993
We also find out that he underwent surgery for leukemia

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,561
when he was a child.

7
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:18,961
That boy had leukemia!

8
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,261
Furthermore, a member of the Black Organization

9
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:24,003
sneaks into the hospital that she is staying in.

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,661
I met all three suspects in person

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,061
and tracked down who the one that snuck into the hospital was.

12
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:35,261
The only possibility left is probably the one lying,

13
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:38,017
saying that he has fainting spells and nausea because of his sprained neck

14
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:41,261
and is extending his hospital stay.

15
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,061
And that man is Rikumichi Kusuda.

16
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,061
There's only him.

17
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,561
Should we nab him right away?

18
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:52,031
No. Let's watch him for a while.

19
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:55,661
We can nab him after he gives himself away.

20
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:56,761
Although very slight,

21
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,261
there's a possibility that he's an ordinary patient

22
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:01,761
who's after insurance money too.

23
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,661
Well, I think it's safest if we watch him with a lot of men,

24
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,047
and as soon as he makes any queer moves, we nab him.

25
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:09,461
Right.

26
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,761
By the way,

27
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,261
please think seriously

28
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,061
about moving Rena Mizunashi to another hospital.

29
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,061
Yeah.

30
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,063
I'll go talk it over with the head of the hospital now.

31
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,065
I'll ask him whether he has any doctor acquaintances,

32
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,461
who is understanding and can keep secrets.

33
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,661
I'd sure like to move her somehow

34
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,661
before we nab Kusuda, though.

35
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,061
Maybe we should take her to the States with us after all then.

36
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,361
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:02,101
Sizzling hot suspense.

38
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,561
A red scream and black bullet

39
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:04,661
whizz through the darkness.

40
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:06,661
The Black Organization finally finds out

41
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,561
where Rena Mizunashi a.k.a Kir are!

42
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,109
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:11,861
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,461
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

47
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, should I check the second floor?

48
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,400
Yes, thank you.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,500
Could you check on Mr. Chikada for me too?

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,900
All right.

My, Mr. Nezu's nurse call again at this time of night.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,600
I wonder if it's a mistake again?

54
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,900
Mizunashi.

55
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,267
She not in this hospital ward either.

56
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,500
Hey, you? What're you doing?

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,800
I got lost.

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,100
I was looking for the men's room.

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh. It's down the stairs right up ahead.

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Thank you.

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,100
Come on, hurry up and do what you have to do

62
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,700
and go back to your room!

63
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,000
Here.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Thank you.

65
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:28,700
Isn't it kind of strange, nurse?

66
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,309
I mean if you look at this camera,

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,100
it's only natural for you to imagine that

68
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,800
I was in the nurse station taking pictures of something

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
and yet, you're letting me get away with it.

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Who the heck are you?

71
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,400
FBI.

72
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
Put both hands around your head in clear view

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,900
and get down on your knees!

74
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,000
FBI?

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Which means that the place Rena Mizunashi

76
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,700
is taking her beauty nap is here in this hospital.

77
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,500
Yes. We were going to let you go about a bit,

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,355
and grab more conclusive evidence

79
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,357
but I guess it wasn't necessary.

80
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,359
Come on, hurry and get down on your knees

81
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,361
before you wake up the other patients!

82
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,900
I guess I'll wake them up, then.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
By setting this C4 off!

84
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,200
A plastic bomb!

85
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
Don't move!

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,100
Or I'll blow this entire floor up.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,383
Don't move! Don't you dare move.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,387
I'm sure that he's going back to his room

89
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,100
to remove any evidence

90
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,400
and will flee through the window!

91
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Get outside so he doesn't get away!

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
Okay!

93
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,900
No? He didn't go back to his room,

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,401
but instead went out the emergency exit to the parking lot

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,403
and got in his car?

96
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,900
He foresaw our plan?

97
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,417
Shu!

98
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
We're counting on you, Akai!

99
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,800
We've got to somehow manage to nab him

100
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,700
before he contacts the Organization!

101
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,500
Roger. But, we won't be able to stop him from doing so,

102
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,200
if he has the cell phone on him now.

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't worry!

104
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,800
I looked for his cell phone while he was out of his room

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,100
and sunk it in water.

106
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Darn! Doesn't work at a time like this?

107
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,200
You didn't believe us?

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
I just wanted to be 100% sure.

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
But, I'm sure that you already foresaw that rushing to nab him

110
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,700
by openly keeping an eye on him

111
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,467
would probably bring about this result.

112
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,600
Right, Mr. Akai?

113
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Well, I wonder about that.

114
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh, Akai... Shuichi?

115
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,800
You stopped him?

116
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,400
You stopped him from contacting the Organization?

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,600
But he got away to the world beyond with a gun.

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,300
If he committed suicide shooting himself,

119
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,000
the bomb that he had on him was just a bluff.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,400
But, thank god the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi

121
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
is still not known.

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,900
No.

123
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,535
Now, they know for sure where she is.

124
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm sure that he was in some way

125
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,800
reporting his investigation results of this hospital

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,100
on a regular basis to the Organization.

127
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,545
So, if he had been making the report ever day

128
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:30,100
and it stopped coming in completely.

129
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,700
They'll come, maybe as soon as tomorrow.

130
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,200
Those guys!

131
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,000
Haido Central Hospital,

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,563
that's where they caged Kir up.

133
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes.

134
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,567
The man that we snuck into that hospital

135
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,569
suddenly stopped reporting back,

136
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,900
so we made another man go check out what was going on.

137
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Then, there they were, a whole lot of them.

138
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:02,300
FBI agents on guard, hiding here and there all over the place.

139
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,585
I guess they increased the number of agents, thinking that we found out.

140
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:10,000
You owe me gratitude.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,100
Because I'm the one who got information that Kir was hurt badly

142
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,700
and taken to a hospital somewhere.

143
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,100
It seems that the FBI has that kid in custody though.

144
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,000
He's only a kid.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I guess it wouldn't hurt to leave him as is for now, no?

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,400
But, how do you propose we get Kir out,

147
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,200
from the hospital that the FBI is guarding so tightly?

148
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,500
Any false moves and we risk the existence

149
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,700
of the Organization being disclosed to the public.

150
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
True.

151
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
It'd be hard to snatch Kir away from the FBI

152
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,625
as if nothing ever happened.

153
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
That is, if we were to snatch her away.

154
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Huh? Just what do you mean, boss?

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,100
Don't worry, Vodka.

156
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,500
I've made quite a few arrangements already.

157
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, I warn you, do be careful, Gin.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,900
Silver Bullet is on their side with the sharp eyes of an eagle.

159
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,649
Shuichi Akai.

160
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,700
That FBI agent that skimmed my cheek bone with a lead bullet.

161
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,100
I'm going to use this incident against him and get rid of him.

162
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,659
You're shooting him?

163
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,400
Yeah.

164
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,800
I don't know what that person is afraid of about him,

165
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
but one silver bullet

166
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,300
doesn't have a chance against a cannon.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
No. Silver Bullet who is able to pierce through

168
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,400
the Organization (Our) heart has one more bullet.

169
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,691
Move! We've got to move!

170
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:56,007
Now that they know Rena Mizunashi is here,

171
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,697
we can't stay here anymore!

172
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,699
We've got no time to be debating over the matter, do we?

173
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:05,907
But we can't just haphazardly move her around when she's in a coma,

174
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:10,307
not even having a definite hospital where she can be hospitalized.

175
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:13,407
Besides, if we move now,

176
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:17,107
it's more likely we'll end up with bullet-ridden bodies.

177
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:19,907
The agent who's guarding the back area says

178
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,307
he verified a suspicious figure squirming around

179
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,723
on the roof of the next building.

180
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,725
Then, the Organization is already...

181
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,007
We've got to tell the hospital head about this

182
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,907
and think up some strategy right away.

183
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:35,307
No. I don't think that's a good idea.

184
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,107
If we explain the situation and make him cooperate,

185
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,007
it would look as if the hospital

186
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:45,107
sheltered Rena Mizunashi to begin with.

187
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:49,407
However, if the hospital makes no move despite the circumstances,

188
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:52,107
they may conclude that this hospital is an ordinary hospital

189
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:56,207
that has nothing to do with the FBI.

190
00:12:56,207 --> 00:13:00,007
True, now that it's turned out this way,

191
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,761
maybe that's the only way we can protect the hospital.

192
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,763
But, there are many patients

193
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,307
who cannot move from here, you know?

194
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:11,207
We can't just do nothing and wait when we know that

195
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,407
the guys of the Organization will be raiding this place.

196
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,107
We're not just going to wait.

197
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:17,407
We're pulling out.

198
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:19,107
Pulling out?

199
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:21,207
You mean we're leaving her behind and pulling out?

200
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:22,507
No.

201
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:24,783
We're pulling out the strings and waiting.

202
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,207
Let's meet our enemy, the black wolves,

203
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:33,207
who will come to get their comrade who has gone astray.

204
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:36,007
I guess we have no other choice.

205
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:40,507
After all, we did summon more agents over this afternoon.

206
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:42,801
If I knew it were going to turn out this way,

207
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,107
I shouldn't have stopped the guy who took pictures

208
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,407
in the nurse station.

209
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,307
I just didn't want him to give the Organization

210
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:52,607
information on the patients who are not involved.

211
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:55,107
Well, they would've found out either way

212
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:59,507
because Conan seems to have destroyed his cell phone.

213
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,821
No, the boy destroyed the cell phone

214
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:06,825
not to keep the guy from contacting the Organization

215
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,607
but rather to find out how to get in touch with them.

216
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:12,207
If the guy locked himself in the restroom or his room

217
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:15,507
and used the cell phone mail to make contact,

218
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:18,307
there's no way he could've figured out how contact was being made.

219
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,907
But if the cell phone is destroyed,

220
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:23,407
he would be forced to choose a different method.

221
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,507
I see.

222
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:27,107
If the method he chooses to make contact is something we can see,

223
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:30,507
like at a phone booth or an internet cafe,

224
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,207
we would be able to find out to who,

225
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:34,853
in what words and writing style he was making contact with.

226
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,207
Therefore, we would be able to keep in touch with them,

227
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,859
pretending to be him even after nabbing him.

228
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:44,863
Yes. In other words, we, not this boy, are the ones who goofed.

229
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:48,867
We, the FBI.

230
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:53,607
That includes me, who never even thought of something like that.

231
00:14:56,607 --> 00:15:00,407
Let's rest in shifts and wait prepared for them!

232
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,881
If we keep on being uptight,

233
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:05,507
we'll be had it before those guys get here.

234
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:08,207
Yes, you're right.

235
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,207
Well, if I come up with a good idea to counter them,

236
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:14,307
I'll come over and let you know about it.

237
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:18,407
What do think about Shu?

238
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:20,307
What do you mean what do I think?

239
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:24,107
I can't help feeling that he almost feels happy

240
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,905
about the Organization raiding this place.

241
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,107
If I said I didn't feel the same way, I'd be lying.

242
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:32,907
If he gets to confront the Organization,

243
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:36,507
he'll be given a chance to avenge her death too.

244
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,407
Avenge her death?

245
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:41,507
Shu's girlfriend was killed

246
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,907
several months ago, by them.

247
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:44,923
His girlfriend

248
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,607
seems to have been connected with the Organization.

249
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:51,607
Shu said that she was killed because she tried to quit the Organization.

250
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,607
Why was Mr. Akai going with a girl like her?

251
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,935
In order to close in on the Organization.

252
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,307
Although it seems that

253
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:00,939
she wasn't all that deeply involved with the Organization but,

254
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,607
it seems that her younger sister was one of the scientists there.

255
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,945
Younger sister? A scientist?

256
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,949
Yes. Akai became acquainted with her younger sister,

257
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,953
and started making connections with the people around her.

258
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,955
Then, he eventually succeeded in sneaking in.

259
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,957
Although only for three years,

260
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,507
he was a member of the Organization

261
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:26,407
under the alias of Dai Moroboshi from 5 years ago until 2 years ago.

262
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:30,407
He really did a good job within the Organization.

263
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,007
He kept a low profile to start

264
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,607
and gradually started showing his horns.

265
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:39,407
He was given the code name "Rye" and eventually go to work

266
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:43,707
with one of the executives of the Organization called Gin.

267
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:46,985
Gin.

268
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,707
We, the FBI figured that so long as we mark that man,

269
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,007
we would be able to get to their boss,

270
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:54,307
so, we went to their gathering site beforehand

271
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:55,607
and hid there waiting.

272
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:59,607
But they didn't come.

273
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:02,207
Although we waited till the break of day.

274
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,707
Don't tell me that they found out that he was an FBI agent.

275
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:09,007
Yes, by a slight mistake that the agent who was staking out made.

276
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:12,407
So, Shu was brushed off by the Organization, you see!

277
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,307
Then, Mr. Akai's girlfriend was killed then?

278
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:17,015
Nope.

279
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,407
It seemed that her younger sister

280
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:22,407
was an important person to the Organization

281
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,707
that they couldn't lay a hand on her.

282
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:29,027
Shu thought likewise and it seems he never met her since.

283
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,707
Well, even if he wanted to contact her,

284
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:35,033
he couldn't since their address was moved since then

285
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,507
and he had no way of getting in touch with them.

286
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:40,207
The Organization, however, would never leave

287
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:43,041
a woman who pulled in an FBI agent,

288
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:46,407
and may still in the future contact him, to roam free.

289
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,507
Therefore, not being able to take it any longer,

290
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,507
the Organization makes her an offer.

291
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:52,107
They tell her that if she carries out a certain job,

292
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:56,007
they will let her as well as her younger sister leave them.

293
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,707
Of course, the condition was that if she fails,

294
00:17:57,707 --> 00:18:01,407
she and her younger sister would have to die.

295
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:04,407
It seems that the Organization wanted to kill her saying that

296
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,065
she was killed for failing to do the job right, but...

297
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:12,807
She succeeded in carrying out the job of stealing 1 billion yen

298
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:16,107
and ended up being killed for no reason.

299
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:19,077
What was her name...

300
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,079
Her real name was Akemi Miyano.

301
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,407
Alias, Masami Hirota.

302
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,083
I'd never forget.

303
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,207
So, she was no doubt Haibara's older sister.

304
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:33,091
That scientist must've been Haibara!

305
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,807
The reason we know about this in such detail is because

306
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,707
Akai got a mail from her on his cell phone,

307
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:42,107
the day before she carried out this job.

308
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:45,507
Since she found out two years before, that he was an FBI agent,

309
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:48,607
he was not once contacted by her.

310
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:52,807
She probably couldn't forget Akai even after finding out that

311
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:56,307
she was used by the FBI.

312
00:18:56,307 --> 00:19:02,107
And judging from how Akai acted after she died.

313
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:07,407
Yes. Shu also probably liked her.

314
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,807
I'm sorry! I was careless!

315
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:44,207
No, I was absent-minded too.

316
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:47,807
Doesn't your head hurt? How about your body?

317
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,707
I'm fine.

318
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,507
I'm glad!

319
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:53,607
I'll go get the doctor right now!

320
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:54,707
Hey!

321
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,807
What's your name?

322
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:00,107
Akemi Miyano.

323
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:04,307
I'm Dai Moroboshi.

324
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:07,185
Nice to meet you.

325
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,187
Same here!

326
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,007
Dai.

327
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:16,107
If I get to quit the Organization after this job,

328
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:20,507
will you go out with me as my real boyfriend?

329
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,205
"Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job"

330
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,707
"will you go out with me as my real boyfriend? Akemi"

331
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,107
Hey.

332
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:35,807
May I talk to you for a while?

333
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:38,007
If you're thinking of the strategy to counter-attack them,

334
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,207
I'm still thinking about it.

335
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:44,207
But, I was looking at you, and thought

336
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:49,227
that maybe you're thinking exactly what I'm thinking.

337
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,507
Time to rest.

338
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,307
-We've got a long night. -Oh, yes.

339
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:13,607
Mr. Akai! An emergency session will be convened.

340
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,907
-Strategy meeting? -Yes.

341
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:23,907
I hope we've got a good strategy.

342
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,507
Hey, get up, Rena Mizunashi.

343
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:45,607
If you don't wake up,

344
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:49,807
I can't ask you how my older sister Hidemi is doing!

345
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,907
Hey, get up! Please get up!

346
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:54,407
You're going to be taken somewhere again, aren't you?

347
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:58,107
Before that happens! Please open your eyes! Hey!

348
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:03,607
I'm telling you, open your eyes. Hey, do you hear me?

349
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:10,307
No. Ei-chan.

350
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:17,315
Wait, are you one of the agents that have been summoned here?

351
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:20,407
Yes.

352
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,207
I'm Andre Camel!

353
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,507
I just happened to get a call from my wife.

354
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,607
Then, please hang up quickly!

355
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,407
We're having a strategy meeting!

356
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:36,107
Yes, just as planned.

357
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

358
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,423
Planter.

359
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,214
Next week's episode is another exciting one!

360
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,776
Make sure you tune in to this channel everybody.

361
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:10,760
Push the switch...
