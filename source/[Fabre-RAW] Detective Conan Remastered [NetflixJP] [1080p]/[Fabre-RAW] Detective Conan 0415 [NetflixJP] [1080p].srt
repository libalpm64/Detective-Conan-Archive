1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,620
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,420
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,320
The unlucky day calendar is a point of concern.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,020
An apparition is created from a nightmare.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
Homicide despite tight security.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,420
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,220
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,620
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,925
Evil spirit?

10
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,925
You're asking me to get rid of the curse of an evil spirit?

11
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:06,625
Yes. Well, to put it straightforwardly...

12
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,625
You see, a detective solves cases.

13
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,325
Of course,

14
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,725
we've asked priests and clairvoyants to try and perform exorcisms,

15
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,525
but nothing seems to be working so far.

16
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:20,925
So we have gone for the last resort, the Mouri Detective Agency

17
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,425
in hopes that you may be able

18
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:25,425
to solve this paranormal phenomena scientifically.

19
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:28,325
And? Just what is that paranormal phenomenon?

20
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,025
It all started with a nightmare

21
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,025
that the master of the house had seen two years ago.

22
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,325
A nightmare?

23
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,925
He jumped up from bed

24
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,625
screaming in a chilling voice that wasn't from this world.

25
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,625
And when I opened the door,

26
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,625
he said, "It's a curse. I'm going to be killed."

27
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,125
He keeps on repeating those words again and again.

28
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,825
But that was only a dream, right?

29
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,725
Of course, that's not the only thing!

30
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:53,425
Six months after that, the brakes of this car that the master was riding

31
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:56,125
went out of control and he barely escaped a big accident.

32
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,825
Isn't it right, Mr. Watabiki? You remember it, don't you?

33
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:03,825
Yes. I didn't realize that the brake oil was leaking.

34
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,925
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:09,925
Because of that accident, the master came down with a heart ailment.

36
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:13,225
His eye became sunken and his hair turned completely white.

37
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:17,025
But it can also be considered a mere accident.

38
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,025
In what way is an evil spirit involved?

39
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:22,025
We can't help but think it's the doings of an evil spirit.

40
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,225
With this kind of card being sent to us.

41
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,025
Card?

42
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:33,825
"Atone your sins before I shall awaken. I am the fifth soul."

43
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:40,925
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (The Case)"

44
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:43,625
And when did you get this card?

45
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,725
Around a little after New Year's Day last year.

46
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,325
It was in the mailbox.

47
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:51,725
At first, we thought it was just a prank,

48
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:56,725
but when I showed it to the master, his wife was also very surprised.

49
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:59,125
-His wife was also surprised? -Yes.

50
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:04,025
Then six months later, the dish cabinet suddenly toppled over.

51
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,525
Furthermore in April of this year,

52
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:08,725
a strange sound was heard from inside the house

53
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,525
where only the master and his wife were supposed to be.

54
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:14,525
Was there something in common about the days when strange things happened?

55
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:18,225
Like things always happened on Friday the 13th or something like that.

56
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,825
No.

57
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,525
The days were at random,

58
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:24,525
but the date was always on the 4th.

59
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:28,525
Then maybe something happened on the 4th previously?

60
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:32,825
But no one has any idea.

61
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:36,625
Today is October 3rd,

62
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,325
so tomorrow is the problem date, the 4th.

63
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,525
That's true.

64
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:47,825
It seems that strange things happened five times so far.

65
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:50,625
Do you remember what year and what month it was?

66
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,225
No, I don't.

67
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:54,725
I do!

68
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,925
At first,

69
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,925
two years ago on February 4th, the master had a nightmare.

70
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:07,025
Then he got into an accident in the same year on July 4th.

71
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:11,025
A year ago, on February 4th, a strange card was found in the mailbox

72
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:14,725
and on July 4th the same year, the dish cabinet fell.

73
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:18,725
On April 4th this year, a strange sound was heard from inside the house.

74
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,525
You've taken notes of everything!

75
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:26,525
Yes. I have to write things down because I'm so forgetful.

76
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,125
He's just like you, Conan.

77
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,325
Right.

78
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:39,525
Maybe the sender of this card is up to something.

79
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:43,225
By the way, don't you sense anything about this card?

80
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:46,425
Sense something? You mean like something spiritual?

81
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:49,325
Well, you know...

82
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:51,825
Well, if you don't sense anything...

83
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,425
I heard differently!

84
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,925
I thought we were going to have just one guest?

85
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:06,325
I'm sorry. My daughter insisted on coming so.

86
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,825
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,825
No, I'm not angry at you people!

88
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:14,325
I'm angry at this old man here who didn't bother to contact me!

89
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:16,125
Old man...

90
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,625
Namika.

91
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,025
I've got to go and shop for more stuff then.

92
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:23,225
You sure have a perky daughter.

93
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,825
No. She's the chef.

94
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:26,925
Chef?

95
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:32,125
Her father used to be the chef for the Kunitomo family.

96
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,125
But he died of an accident and she succeeded him.

97
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,725
She's still so young.

98
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:43,025
Come to think of it, he also took after his father.

99
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,625
That's right, Mr. Watabiki!

100
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:49,525
The master will be going to the University Hospital at 20:00 tonight.

101
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,425
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:54,125
Huh?

103
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,825
Out of ink?

104
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:56,825
Here!

105
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,725
Use this.

106
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,525
Thank you.

107
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:11,325
I'm sorry. Please don't be offended.

108
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:15,725
I experienced food poisoning when I was a child.

109
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:19,425
And since then I've become a neat paranoiac.

110
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,325
Here you go. Thank you.

111
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:24,025
Okay.

112
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:26,925
Conan?

113
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,125
We're going to leave you behind.

114
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,725
Leave him! Leave him!

115
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,725
The master and his wife?

116
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,525
I saw them a while ago in the third floor bedroom.

117
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,225
Okay.

118
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,525
Huh?

119
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,925
What is it?

120
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,625
You sure look like the chef we saw a while ago.

121
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,125
It hurts!

122
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,725
Dad!

123
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:49,725
Of course we look alike!

124
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:52,725
Namika is my daughter.

125
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,625
No wonder.

126
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,325
And please don't point your finger at me, okay?

127
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,625
I have belonephobia.

128
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,425
I see.

129
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:04,725
Belonephobia?

130
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,625
Dad.

131
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:11,625
If you have a message for the master, shall I go relay it for you?

132
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,725
No. I'll go see him myself.

133
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:17,325
By the way, Shigeko. That picture...

134
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:21,325
Will you please fix it in place?

135
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:25,725
I think it is about five millimetres tilted to the right.

136
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,625
Huh?

137
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,525
Five millimetres?

138
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,725
Yes, sir!

139
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,225
Thank you.

140
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,025
Shall we go, then?

141
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,925
What a strange place for a door to be.

142
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,625
Oh, that's the door

143
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,725
that a friend of Mrs. Kunitomo installed

144
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:59,325
after they received that weird card.

145
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,125
It's quite some door.

146
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:09,125
You push the passcode like so and place your index finger here.

147
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,325
Who is it?

148
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,525
I'm Akatsuka, the steward.

149
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,525
I've brought Detective Mouri with me.

150
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,625
I'll open the door right away.

151
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,825
Like so.

152
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,925
Fantastic!

153
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:31,425
It's made so that the bell doesn't ring inside

154
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:36,725
unless it's the registered fingerprints of a family member.

155
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:38,825
It's just like some science fiction movie.

156
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:41,125
It's not science fiction at all.

157
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:49,425
There are condos equipped with fingerprint recognition machines nowadays.

158
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,925
Although it's not that all widespread yet.

159
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,925
Right.

160
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:57,425
This is Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo, and the person to the left

161
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:02,025
is the person who made the door, Mrs. Kunitomo's friend, Mr. Sekiguchi.

162
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:06,625
It seems that someone who was inside opened this door a while ago,

163
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,125
but what if nobody is on the third floor either?

164
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,825
No one can open the door.

165
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,525
Except for my husband whose fingerprints

166
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,325
are set inside the fingerprint recognition machine.

167
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,425
Anyone in this house can go out

168
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,625
by placing his finger on the machine though.

169
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,725
I'd like to give it a try.

170
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,125
Don't touch it!

171
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,225
When someone from outside places his finger on the machine,

172
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,925
the alarm within the house will go off

173
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:32,025
and the people from the security office will rush over here!

174
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:34,025
It hurts.

175
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:37,225
I also thought that we should put up surveillance cameras too, but...

176
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,625
I told him not to do it.

177
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,525
A camera at the front entrance is okay,

178
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,825
but I'm setting up such exaggerated security precautions

179
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:48,725
in this fine house that my father had built.

180
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,625
I think it has enough exaggerated security precautions already.

181
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,325
You're Mr. Mouri, the renown detective!

182
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,325
Yes.

183
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,825
I'm Kunitomo, the one who asked for you.

184
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,025
It hurts...

185
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:05,725
I'm counting on you as far as the investigation is concerned.

186
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,825
Yes, sir.

187
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:14,925
I shall give you a quick tour of the house then.

188
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,325
Thank you.

189
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,425
Kid, hurry up!

190
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,125
Okay!

191
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:32,625
Are you sure it's okay calling a detective over?

192
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,125
If he finds out about the, you know what...

193
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,625
He won't. There's no evidence of it anywhere anymore.

194
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,625
But from what was written on that card...

195
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,225
That's why we hired a detective.

196
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,325
To have him catch the one who is blackmailing us

197
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,025
and find out how far he knows, right?

198
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,525
Wait! I'll go get your medicine right away.

199
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,725
Here, your medicine!

200
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,525
Hey, are you okay?

201
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,725
At the rate you're going,

202
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,525
you're going to drop dead before we catch the culprit.

203
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,725
Watch your mouth!

204
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:15,625
You're the one to blame for what happened to begin with, you know!

205
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,525
That's why I'm here, aren't I?

206
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:21,225
Tomorrow's the X Day in question, right?

207
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,425
Yes.

208
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:26,325
The day that this mansion's mouse begins to move.

209
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,736
And?

210
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,236
How is it?

211
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,936
How?

212
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,136
It's good of course.

213
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:00,036
Oh, no. I'm not talking about the food,

214
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,836
but the investigation.

215
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:06,236
I can't say yet, for now.

216
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:11,836
Even if someone were to set it up,

217
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,136
so that the dish cabinet would fall or queer sounds would be made,

218
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,536
I'm sure the gadgets would've been retrieved by now.

219
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:18,936
Not again!

220
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:21,136
Wearing gloves when eating.

221
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,636
Everything's washed clean. How rude!

222
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,936
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:28,836
It's about time I take the master to the hospital.

224
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:32,236
Why don't you at least drink your coffee before you go?

225
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,836
Those two get along well, don't they?

226
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:43,636
Yes. Their parents were best friends and they're childhood friends.

227
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,436
Excuse me. Could I have some coffee, too?

228
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,736
Here.

229
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,336
Huh?

230
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:55,736
Here, give it to me.

231
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,236
I'm sorry, mother.

232
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,336
She's acrophobic,

233
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:04,336
so she can't go near a window that's more than second floors high.

234
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:08,336
By the way, that steward is a meticulous perfectionist

235
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,636
and hates things that are crooked.

236
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:14,936
Even if it's a tablecloth, if he finds that it's crooked...

237
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,236
See!

238
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:22,036
What is wrong with this house?

239
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:28,836
Neat paranoiac, onephobia, acrophobe, and a meticulous perfectionist.

240
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,136
I took the job only because

241
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:36,636
I thought we could spend the night at the mansion of a tycoon in Shizuoka.

242
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,436
Conan, we should've stayed home

243
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,136
if this kind of spook story was going to come up, right?

244
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,936
What're you looking at?

245
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,336
Oh, well...

246
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:47,736
The dates of the five incidents that happened here.

247
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,536
The first one was two years ago on February 4th.

248
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,436
The next one was on July 4th.

249
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:55,236
Last year, it also happened on February 4th and July 4th.

250
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:58,036
And this year, it's April the 4th, right?

251
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,536
I wonder why it's April 4th only this year?

252
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,636
Beats me. If it's the 5th,

253
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:07,836
Dad was out on February 5th and July 5th last year and two years ago.

254
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:08,836
Huh?

255
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:12,036
Don't you remember? You went to a wedding, helped people move

256
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,036
and went on a trip with the community committee.

257
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,036
Come to think of it,

258
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:18,036
I went to a wedding on the 5th of April this year, too.

259
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:23,236
A lucky day is usually chosen for weddings, trips and moving, right?

260
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,936
Yes.

261
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,136
Right.

262
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:30,436
Which means the day before those days are all Butsumetsu?

263
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:32,736
Butsumetsu?

264
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,136
Wait!

265
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,636
If I remember correctly, the supermarket

266
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,836
will be having a grand opening on October 5th, the day after tomorrow.

267
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,436
So what does that mean?

268
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:43,036
Does that mean that tomorrow, October the 4th is Butsumetsu

269
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:44,536
and something's going to happen?

270
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:46,836
To be exact, it's already today.

271
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,136
What was that?

272
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,736
What was that sound?

273
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,736
A shoe?

274
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:28,336
Mr. Akatsuka? This is Yasue.

275
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:31,436
We got a flat tire so we were a bit stalled.

276
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:35,636
We're late, but we should be arriving there soon.

277
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:39,536
What? Mr. Sekiguchi?

278
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:44,036
Yes. On the veranda where your bedroom is.

279
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,636
We called the ambulance and the police right away,

280
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,336
but the only person who can enter the third floor is Mr. Kunitomo,

281
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:51,436
so no one has gone in yet.

282
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,136
Please hurry back!

283
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:56,736
What on earth is going on?

284
00:16:56,736 --> 00:17:00,736
It's a curse. It's an evil spirit after all.

285
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,036
Dear?

286
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:06,536
Here is your medicine!

287
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:10,136
Mr. Watabiki, please hurry!

288
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:13,036
Yes! I'll try my best.

289
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:21,836
The victim is Mr. Toshimichi Sekiguchi, age 43.

290
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:27,936
The estimated time of death is 4 hours ago between 20:30 to 21:00.

291
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:33,736
Mr. Sekiguchi was your friend, Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo.

292
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,836
Yes. We were classmates in high school.

293
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:39,136
He is the president of a security company now.

294
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:43,336
Which means that the fingerprint recognition device installed

295
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:46,336
at the entrance of the third floor was put there by Mr. Sekiguchi, right?

296
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,736
Yes.

297
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:52,736
Would you please tell me where you were between 20:30 and 21:00?

298
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:56,436
I was in the car. On my way to the hospital with my husband.

299
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:00,836
My husband has a heart ailment so on the 3rd of every month,

300
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:04,436
we go to doctor acquaintance of ours to have him checked.

301
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:06,136
What time did you leave the house?

302
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,636
I think it was just about 20:00.

303
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:11,136
Are you suspecting us?

304
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:17,336
I'm sure that Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo left here at 20:00!

305
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:19,636
I see.

306
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:22,436
I came here to the 3rd floor

307
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,936
at 5 minutes to 20:00 in order to take the two to the car.

308
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:31,736
Besides, at that time, Mr. Sekiguchi was alive.

309
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,236
I see.

310
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:39,536
Could Mr. Sekiguchi have committed suicide?

311
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:44,136
Well, there are some queer points as to his death.

312
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:47,036
The position of the rope that he put his neck through

313
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:50,336
is much too close to the railing of the veranda!

314
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:52,636
Well, he could've done so even if he was close.

315
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,436
But he would've had an extremely difficult time doing so.

316
00:18:55,436 --> 00:19:00,436
So this may be homicide made to look like a suicide.

317
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:04,336
Well, we can't tell whether it's suicide or homicide yet, but...

318
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:08,536
This card that reads, "I atone my sins of 13 years ago"

319
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:11,636
is sure to be the key to solving the case.

320
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:14,636
Mr. Mouri, where did you get that?

321
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:20,136
I found it in Mr. Sekiguchi's clothes before the police got here.

322
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:23,736
You shouldn't do stuff like that on your own.

323
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:27,036
Right, that's why I gave him a good licking.

324
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:29,036
Huh?

325
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,136
Isn't that right, kid?

326
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,136
What is this card anyway?

327
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:36,136
A sin of 13 years ago?

328
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:37,536
Beats me.

329
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:41,036
It kind of looks to be a dying message, too.

330
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:43,436
But I guess we can ask the three who went pale

331
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:46,036
when they saw this card for the details?

332
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,736
What seems to be the matter?

333
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,736
Does something 13 years ago come to mind?

334
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:58,336
It was just about 13 years ago.

335
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:02,336
The master's cruiser had a marine accident.

336
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:03,936
Marine accident?

337
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:08,636
Yes. Back then, every year, just about this time,

338
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:14,036
it was usual practice for all of us here to go cruising on master's boat,

339
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:16,036
but it got stranded off shore the Suruga Bay.

340
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:17,336
Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo

341
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,636
and Mr. Sekiguchi who just happened to be sailing that day

342
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,936
somehow made it to safety.

343
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:24,636
And what about the others?

344
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:28,336
The whereabouts of everyone else is unknown.

345
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:31,236
The ship that sunk hasn't been found yet either.

346
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:36,136
Could it be that Mr. Sekuguchi caused the ship to sink

347
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,936
so someone had a grudge against him?

348
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:41,636
Well, I hate the sea.

349
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:44,436
So I never went with them.

350
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:47,636
Since you two were saved, you know what happened, don't you?

351
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,936
The reason why the ship sank.

352
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:54,836
No. Because I was sleeping

353
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,136
when Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly shouted to run for it.

354
00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:00,136
We were desperate to flee that we didn't know what was going on.

355
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:04,536
Is there anybody here that is the bereaved family of a victim

356
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:06,336
of that accident and working here?

357
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,036
Yes.

358
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:11,036
Which means that this case may also be connected

359
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,236
in some way to the five others incidents that happened here.

360
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,936
Five incidents?

361
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:18,936
It happened.

362
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:21,336
Mr. Kunitomo had nightmares.

363
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:23,736
The car brakes didn't function.

364
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:26,836
The dish cabinet falls down in the middle of the night

365
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:28,436
And strange sounds are heard

366
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,136
at a place where no one is supposed to be there.

367
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:38,136
And to top things off is this card that was found directly in the mailbox.

368
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,336
Please wait a minute.

369
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:45,636
It looks exactly like the card that was found in on Mr. Sekiguchi.

370
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:50,036
Moreover, if all the incidents are happening on "Butsumetsu the 4th",

371
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,736
it's natural to think that someone in this house

372
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:55,636
is up to something, isn't it?

373
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:59,336
I see. Someone who is still working here

374
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:02,936
and is a bereaved family member of the victim of the accident.

375
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,436
That person may have thought

376
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:07,836
that Mr. Sekiguchi was responsible for the accident and killed him.

377
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:13,636
So please call the people who fit in to this category here.

378
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,636
Yes, sir.

379
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,836
Mr. Sekiguchi's wristwatch...

380
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:20,536
Something's engraved on it.

381
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,036
"E" and "N"?

382
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:26,736
"E" and "N" would usually mean...

383
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,836
Huh? Maybe not...

384
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,336
Which means...

385
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,840
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,600
"Fingerprint"

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,260
-Conan, show me your fingerprint. -Okay.

388
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,720
Your fingerprint is just like Shinichi's.

389
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,980
Surprised?
