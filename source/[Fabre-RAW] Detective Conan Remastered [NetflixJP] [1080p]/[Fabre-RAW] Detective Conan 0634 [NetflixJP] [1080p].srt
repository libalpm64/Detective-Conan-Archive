1
00:00:02,614 --> 00:00:04,314
Like the fog clears.

2
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:06,414
Let's see through love and crime as well.

3
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,014
A small restaurant with a taste of the Showa Era to it.

4
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:10,014
An ingenious trick in a cramped place.

5
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:11,714
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:13,514
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,814
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:03,245
"Scene of the Crime is a Super Cramped Shop"

9
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:11,145
Come in! We have special discounts!

10
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,345
Come in!

11
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:14,145
"Satsuki"

12
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:15,745
Geez.

13
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:19,245
The main race was really a throw off.

14
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,245
I didn't make it.

15
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:23,745
With such a dark horse like that making goal,

16
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:27,245
there's no hope of winning.

17
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:30,345
Are they all here for the Tohoto Derby too?

18
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:34,345
A lot of derby fans hang out here on Saturdays.

19
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:37,945
We come here directly after the race is over.

20
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,645
We talk about winning, losing and the like.

21
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,245
I see.

22
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:47,145
Well, you see, same here.

23
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:50,045
Huh? May I see it?

24
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,645
Sure!

25
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:55,145
Trifecta of 1, 2, 3...

26
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:57,845
This is today's long shot win!

27
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,645
-What? -What?

28
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:03,745
Right!

29
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:06,945
My, sir, how wonderful.

30
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:12,245
So, I shall foot everybody's bill tonight!

31
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:14,045
But this ticket...

32
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:18,145
Ma'am! Give everyone a drink each to start!

33
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:21,945
My, my. You sure are generous, sir!

34
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,945
It's no big deal!

35
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,945
What was that?

36
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,145
Oh, this?

37
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,745
It's something I devised.

38
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,545
This shop is so cramped

39
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:42,445
that using this makes moving around easier.

40
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,845
See!

41
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,845
I see.

42
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:55,645
I sure wish I get to experience some kind of windfall, too.

43
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:59,145
I thought you were getting retirement pay soon?

44
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,345
Retirement pay?

45
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:04,545
No, no, it's just chicken feed.

46
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,545
Hey, hey.

47
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:10,745
Take me to Hawaii with that money, won't you?

48
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,045
Come off it.

49
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:17,745
You're quite extravagant, aren't you, Mr. Richie?

50
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:20,745
If you wish, would you like me to serve you more expensive liquor

51
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:24,745
than the cheap one you're drinking now?

52
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,145
No, thank you.

53
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:29,845
You go ahead to Shonan Hawaiian Center or something, okay?

54
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,345
True.

55
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:36,345
Since I go to that hotel every year to do my recitals,

56
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,245
so it may be a good idea!

57
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,245
There you go!

58
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:42,245
Recitals?

59
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:47,445
I teach Japanese dancing.

60
00:04:57,145 --> 00:05:01,645
Really, you get carried away every time you get drunk.

61
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:04,045
Since you're doing recitals,

62
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:08,045
I'm sure you're prospering with your classes too.

63
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,845
No, no.

64
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:18,045
She slipped at her recital, did a grand leg split and fell!

65
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:21,145
There's no way that a class with a teacher like that would prosper.

66
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:25,745
Why do you remember such useless things?

67
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:27,545
Recitals my foot.

68
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:30,045
You don't know where you stand.

69
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:33,745
What did you just say? Try again!

70
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:37,745
Are you sure you want to talk to me like that?

71
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,345
Come, come, cool head.

72
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,645
It looks delicious.

73
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:48,745
Yes.

74
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:52,745
I just happened to come into this shop when I came here.

75
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:57,745
At present, she's like a mother and makes these dishes for me.

76
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,045
He came to Tokyo wanting to be a cook

77
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,245
for a high class Japanese restaurant.

78
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:07,745
But he couldn't make his dream come true, you see.

79
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:11,145
Are you still at the fish market I introduced you to?

80
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,745
Yes, thanks to you.

81
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,545
You take care of people, don't you?

82
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,345
If one wants to be a fish vendor,

83
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,045
you've got to have an eye for fish, don't you?

84
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:23,845
Right, Mr. Shinohara?

85
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,345
Yes, I'm learning much!

86
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:31,945
I see. That's why he got a job at the fish market.

87
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:36,645
By the way, why are your slacks wet?

88
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,645
When I was walking down the alley a while ago...

89
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:43,545
The shop owner accidentally splash water from a bucket on him.

90
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:46,145
Huh? How'd you know?

91
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:48,045
You mean she did it again?

92
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,345
I mean, she doesn't care what method she uses.

93
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:53,645
She always does that to get those who feel generous

94
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,145
after winning the horse races to come to her shop.

95
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:58,645
You keep it up and one day the heavens are going to punish you.

96
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:01,745
Stop talking stink about her!

97
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,545
She's the one who saved me when I came to Tokyo to work,

98
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,545
but couldn't find anything and was at a loss what to do!

99
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,945
No need to get so upset.

100
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:15,045
I've been feeling a draft for a while now.

101
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,545
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,945
This place is made of wood and tin patched together

103
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,145
so wind blows in from this space.

104
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:25,845
I'm getting chilly too, so I'm going to the bathroom.

105
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,945
Come on, come on,

106
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:29,745
the lady's going through!

107
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:32,145
I guess we've got no choice since the shop's so cramped.

108
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:35,645
"Satsuki"

109
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,745
Now that I've stood up,

110
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:41,945
I guess I'll go buy myself some cigarettes.

111
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,445
I've got to go to the automatic teller

112
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,345
to withdraw money before it closes.

113
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,645
I guess I'll go get a puff too.

114
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,245
Cigarettes, cigarettes...

115
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,245
Huh?

116
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,145
Was it here?

117
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,045
Dad's recently drinking in this area.

118
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:25,545
It's a wonder how they can drink with so much smoke around.

119
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,445
Isn't that Pops?

120
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,645
Oh, right.

121
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,845
Taking a puff in a place like this?

122
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,445
Huh? What're you all doing?

123
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,845
So you've all come back.

124
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,545
Ma'am!

125
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,645
Ma'am, get a hold of yourself!

126
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,945
Ma'am!

127
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:56,445
What?

128
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:06,289
That's more or less and rough summary of what happened.

129
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:10,189
A stab through the chest is the cause of death.

130
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:11,789
The name Satsuki was carved on the handle of the knife

131
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:14,589
that is the murder weapon.

132
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,189
It seems that all the knives that the owner

133
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,489
used at this shop had the same name carved on the handles.

134
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:24,189
There were no signs of things being taken from the shop.

135
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,889
Robbery seems very unlikely.

136
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,289
And, what brings you here, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:34,189
Yes, sir. I won by a long shot,

138
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,389
so I was treating the customers here.

139
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,689
You seemed to be having a lot of fun.

140
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,589
No, not really.

141
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,089
And, when the crime occurred all of us including me,

142
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,089
were all outside the shop.

143
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,589
I see. Only the owner was in the shop alone.

144
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,589
And it's not possible to look inside from outside

145
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,089
since the window is smoked.

146
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,089
Yes.

147
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,689
So it means that only the customers knew she was alone.

148
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:06,489
So while everybody else was outside,

149
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:10,489
one of the customers killed her.

150
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:13,389
Okay, let's hear them out then.

151
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:18,389
What do you mean you want to hear us out?

152
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,889
Judging from the circumstances,

153
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:25,489
it's highly likely that one of you is the culprit.

154
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,789
Don't be ridiculous!

155
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:30,489
So, please tell us where and what you were doing

156
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:35,389
during the 5 minutes that the incident took place.

157
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:39,589
Come to think of it, back then...

158
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,389
After everyone came out of the shop,

159
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,589
Ms. Oogi didn't come out from the shop for a while.

160
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,389
Ms. Oogi could've been waiting for a chance

161
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,489
to be alone with the owner.

162
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,189
Why would I want to do something like that?

163
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:56,089
Don't tell me that you borrowed money from the owner

164
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,889
because your classroom was about to go broke?

165
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,389
How dare you!

166
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,689
The owner was rumored

167
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:03,989
for being mellow like Buddha when lending money,

168
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,289
but was said to turn into a devil

169
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,489
when she came to collect what she lent back.

170
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:09,589
I see.

171
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,089
Is it true that you borrowed money from the owner?

172
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,289
Yes.

173
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:18,289
She's been bugging me almost every day recently

174
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:19,789
demanding to have her money back.

175
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,489
Just today too, when I was about to leave the shop,

176
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,889
she closed in on me demanding to have me pay her back right away.

177
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:29,089
So, you were outraged, took the knife on the counter and...

178
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,089
No! Our argument was getting nowhere, so I left!

179
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,789
But, since she ended up like that...

180
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,989
I found it hard to come out and say anything about it!

181
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,289
Huh?

182
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,889
The sleeve of this person is wet.

183
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,589
Huh?

184
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:46,789
I see!

185
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,089
If I remember correctly, you're left-handed, right?

186
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,489
You used your left hand when you drank wine,

187
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,289
used your fan

188
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:56,589
or put the thumb tack back on!

189
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,989
Isn't your sleeve wet because you went to the restroom

190
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,689
and washed off the blood that splattered on you

191
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,489
when you stabbed the owner?

192
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,289
The faucet of the restroom was broken

193
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,389
and water came gushing out, that's all!

194
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:12,289
Just to be sure, have forensics check for luminol reaction.

195
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:15,889
Yes, sir. Come this way, please.

196
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,689
By the way, Mr. Nakamura.

197
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,789
What is it?

198
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:26,489
After saying that you were going to buy cigarettes and left the shop,

199
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,489
you turned right at the forked alley.

200
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,789
By the way, when you returned,

201
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,789
you came from the opposite direction, right?

202
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,389
The cigarette vending machine here and yet,

203
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,989
why did you return from the opposite side?

204
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:44,189
That's because the cigarettes of the vending machine were sold out

205
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,389
so I went to the cigarette shop on the main road.

206
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,589
Inspector!

207
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,189
I found the owner's notebook.

208
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:53,189
There's a monthly deposit of 100,000 made

209
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,989
under the name of Nakamura.

210
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,989
That amount's too large to be just for drinking.

211
00:12:57,989 --> 00:12:59,989
Can you explain what this money is for?

212
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,289
Well, that's...

213
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,789
The owner had a hold of something I didn't want anybody to know.

214
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,489
Secret?

215
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,789
She was blackmailing me saying that

216
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:15,089
she would disclose to my company that I embezzled money

217
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,389
and was spending it on horse racing.

218
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:20,889
But I didn't do it!

219
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:24,389
I really went to the cigarette shop on the main street!

220
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,489
By the way, Mr. Shinohara.

221
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,589
Yes?

222
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,589
In her notes here, your name is mentioned here and there

223
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,589
and things like mackerel and squids are written.

224
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:37,589
Can you explain this?

225
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,489
I'm working part-time at the fish market,

226
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:42,989
so I used to take orders from her off and on.

227
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,989
Isn't it a record of the orders?

228
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:49,089
What were you doing during the 5 minutes that you left the shop?

229
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,889
Since I didn't have any cash on me,

230
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:54,289
I went to withdraw money from the automatic teller nearby.

231
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,689
I've got the breakdown sheet with me, too.

232
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,189
Here it is.

233
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:01,689
There's no mistake about the time either.

234
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,789
After leaving the shop,

235
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,689
Mr. Shinohara walked towards the main street.

236
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,589
The automatic teller is here,

237
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,689
so it would be impossible for him to sneak back to the shop.

238
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,989
Given that there are no inconsistencies on his ATM receipt...

239
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,089
It seems impossible for him to have killed her.

240
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,689
Pops said that he treated everybody.

241
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:31,389
All the knives that are inside the stand are Japanese knives.

242
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,689
This is...

243
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:39,089
Juice?

244
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:41,589
If I remember correctly, the owner was a non-drinker.

245
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,389
Brandy glass.

246
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,789
It hasn't been used yet.

247
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:57,889
The brandy bottle.

248
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,089
I see. I got it.

249
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,889
The trick of this case.

250
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,889
Hey, hey. Snoozing off during investigations?

251
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,189
I guess I'll attach a compact speaker on him now then.

252
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,189
Conan!

253
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:40,989
Don't go off on your own.

254
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,789
-Okay. -Inspector Megure.

255
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,289
As a result of the test performed by forensics,

256
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:48,789
no luminol reaction was found on Mr. Oogi's clothes.

257
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,489
I also confirmed with the cigarette vendor on the main street

258
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,589
and he testified that Mr. Nakamura

259
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,189
did in fact come to make the purchase.

260
00:15:57,989 --> 00:15:59,989
I guess I don't have to use it today.

261
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:02,189
Okay, everyone.

262
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:05,189
We'd like to hear more in detail at the station.

263
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:08,289
Inspector, you don't need to do that.

264
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,389
I will solve the case right here this minute.

265
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,389
-What? -What?

266
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,089
Mr. Mouri, did you figure out who the culprit is?

267
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:16,589
Yes!

268
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,689
The brandy glass that was placed on the cutting board

269
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,889
told me who the culprit is!

270
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,989
Huh? Brandy?

271
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:29,089
Please give me a glass too, Inspector!

272
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,589
Oh no! He woke up!

273
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,089
Are you all right?

274
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,789
I'm fine.

275
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,989
Please look on top the counter of the shop.

276
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,789
Mr. Oogi had wine.

277
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,389
Mr. Nakamura had Japanese sake.

278
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:51,889
I had beer and Mr. Shinohara had sour.

279
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,889
And on the cutting board,

280
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,189
there're the glass cup of juice that the owner was drinking

281
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:59,689
and a still unused brandy glass.

282
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,989
So, what about it?

283
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:06,689
Who on earth did she take the brandy out for?

284
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,189
There was no customer who ordered brandy

285
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,989
before we left the shop.

286
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,789
It sure is strange.

287
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,289
Please look at the very top of the shelf.

288
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,789
The brandy bottle on the shelf

289
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,189
has been moved a bit, hasn't it?

290
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,889
It's most likely that the culprit after leaving the shop,

291
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:27,189
called the owner

292
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,989
and ordered the expensive brandy that was on the very top shelf.

293
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:33,389
He probably lied and told her that

294
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:36,089
I would be treating everyone to that expensive brandy or something.

295
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,589
In order for the shop owner who is short, to get the brandy bottle,

296
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:41,589
she would have to tiptoe placing her body

297
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,589
close against the shelf and the wall.

298
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:45,289
The culprit with all this in mind

299
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,989
stuck a knife through the space in the wall.

300
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:53,389
He stuck the knife from outside the shop?

301
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,589
In back of the shop,

302
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:57,589
there's a space under the eaves where one person can pass through.

303
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:00,889
And in the patched wall made of wooden boards

304
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,589
and tin plates there are narrow spaces.

305
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:06,089
The culprit made the phone call from under the eaves

306
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,689
and lured the owner to come over to the wall.

307
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:12,189
Then, he stuck the knife through the space and killed her.

308
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:16,989
He probably stole the knife beforehand from the shop.

309
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:20,289
But when I found the owner,

310
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,689
she was facing the front of the counter face down.

311
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:26,289
Right. If she was stabbed near the wall,

312
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,189
she wouldn't fall that way, would she?

313
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:33,089
The chair that the owner was using was a chair that spins

314
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,489
in a cramped shop.

315
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,089
Ironically, just as the shop owner fell,

316
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:39,789
the chair spun round.

317
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,189
That's why she fell facing forward.

318
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,389
But a knife has a handle,

319
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:51,189
so I don't think it'll go through the space in the wall.

320
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,889
How about it, Officer Takagi?

321
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:56,089
Yes, sir. The handle would get stuck.

322
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:59,289
What is there was no handle on the knife?

323
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,689
What?

324
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,189
The handles of western knives

325
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:05,489
used to prepare western food are stuck together using screws.

326
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:08,689
But the handles of Japanese knives are easily removable

327
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,789
because all that needs to be done is to stick the blade into the handle.

328
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:14,289
Inspector! It's just as Mr. Mouri says.

329
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,289
Which means...

330
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,889
The culprit wanted us to find the body,

331
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:22,989
while he went into the counter under the pretense of being worried.

332
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:26,589
Then he put the handle back onto the blade

333
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:29,489
and carried the owner up.

334
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:30,889
No way...

335
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,589
No joke?

336
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,089
Yes.

337
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,389
The only one who could've carried out

338
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:37,489
the trick of using the removable handle of the knife

339
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,389
was the one who was the first to run over to her.

340
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,489
It's you, Mr. Shinohara.

341
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:46,689
But I was over at the automatic teller machine.

342
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:49,089
Right, he has an alibi.

343
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,589
No.

344
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,989
If he were to commit the crime from the back of the shop,

345
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,389
the automatic teller machine is quite close.

346
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,489
It wouldn't serve as alibi.

347
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,289
Being that he wanted to become a cook

348
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,189
for a high class Japanese restaurant...

349
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:02,689
He would've known that

350
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,089
the handle of the Japanese knife was removable.

351
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,289
Do you have definite proof that I did it?

352
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,589
The envelope that you had

353
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,289
the paper of transaction details on that you showed us

354
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,589
was soiled, wasn't it?

355
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,889
That's rust from steel, isn't it?

356
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,089
When you committed the crime,

357
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,089
you were probably holding the blade without the handle on it

358
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,689
with a handkerchief wrapped around it.

359
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:29,289
Therefore, the steel rust from the steel adhered to your handkerchief.

360
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,389
Unaware of this, you put the handkerchief

361
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,589
in the same pocket that the envelope was inside,

362
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:37,489
so the steel rust rubbed off on the envelope.

363
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:40,089
If we check the rust of the tin and that on the envelope,

364
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,889
I'm sure they will match.

365
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,689
But, why?

366
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:48,989
Wasn't she the one who helped you?

367
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:50,689
Wrong!

368
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:52,289
The reason she put on a nice front

369
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,189
and introduced me to the fish market

370
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:57,589
was to make me steal stuff from there!

371
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,289
What?

372
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:03,189
At first, all she demanded was damaged or left-over stuff.

373
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:06,089
But her demands started escalating.

374
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,189
And recently, she would constantly bug me to get her

375
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:11,389
expensive things such as sea urchins, salmon roe, etc.

376
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:13,489
I couldn't take it anymore!

377
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,789
And when I told her I was quitting the job...

378
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,389
If you quit, I'm going to report everything you did till now.

379
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:23,989
If I do that, you'll be jailed for theft.

380
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,289
But you're the one who told me to do it.

381
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,789
Well...

382
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:32,889
Just where do you have proof that I told you to it?

383
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,089
You're the only one who'll be arrested.

384
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:38,489
Well, you probably can't become a Japanese cook either,

385
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:39,989
so maybe it's not all that bad, is it?

386
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,089
I just couldn't give up my dream

387
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:44,189
of becoming a cook of Japanese cuisine.

388
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:45,489
That's why!

389
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:47,789
But you used the knife that is supposed to be

390
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,389
the life of a cook of Japanese cuisine

391
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:52,589
to commit murder.

392
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,589
I don't think you're qualified

393
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:57,989
to be a cook of Japanese cuisine anymore, are you?

394
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:05,689
"Satsuki"

395
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:31,389
Huh?

396
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:34,789
Come to think of it,

397
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,489
didn't Dad say he won by a long shot?

398
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:40,989
Huh? These horse racing tickets are all 100 yen.

399
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,889
Even if I won by a long shot,

400
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,789
it's not much being that the tickets are all 100 yen.

401
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,389
And yet, I showed off and treated everybody,

402
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:50,389
now it's going to take me a long time to earn what I spent.

403
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,489
-What? -Forgive me!

404
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:56,289
-I won't forgive you! Wait up! -Pretty please!

405
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:59,689
I don't think it'll take too long to get him.
