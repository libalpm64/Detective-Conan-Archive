1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,990
 Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,190
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,890
This is the first time Conan is handling a case like this.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,890
Were you able to enjoy his facial expressions

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,090
as well as his deductions?

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,200
We set off on a trip to White Sand Beach in Wakayama Prefecture.

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Despite having a feeling that somebody was watching us,

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,900
we continued sightseeing.

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
Later,

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,700
we find out that one of the five Naniwa University students

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,300
that we met the previous day,

15
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,600
Maki Shinjou was found dead at Sandanbeki.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,700
Among her belongings,

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,000
her wallet and her car key are missing.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In the pocket of her top,

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
she has working gloves.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Also,

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,800
what is the meaning of the tiny bottle

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,200
and the Sour Boy easel?

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,300
Murder-robbery is probably just a camouflage.

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,400
It's most likely that this murder was committed

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
by an acquaintance of hers.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,900
If so, the murderer is among the people here.

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,300
"South Kishu White Sand Beach Mystery Tour (Part 2)"

28
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,250
Okay, everyone,

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,550
please tell us where and what you were doing

30
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,050
from 10:26 in the morning to 11:00.

31
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,650
Just what do you mean by that?

32
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,550
Do you suspect us?

33
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,150
No, we're just verifying things.

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,950
I was sketching at White Sand Beach.

35
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,850
Since there were a lot of tourists,

36
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,050
it shouldn't be hard to verify.

37
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,950
In your case, Ms. Mitsui.

38
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,850
Since you were so near the scene of the crime,

39
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,750
your alibi may not help you much.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,150
But did you do the sketching there the whole time?

41
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,150
That's right.

42
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,050
Any witnesses?

43
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,050
No.

44
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,650
I don't like to be watched what I'm sketching.

45
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,850
So that's why I had them show me a place

46
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,250
where there were not too many people.

47
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,550
Who told you of this place?

48
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,050
Maki did.

49
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,750
She seems to have come to White Sand Beach many times,

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,350
so she knew this place very well.

51
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,950
What about you, Ms. Miyahara?

52
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,350
I was at a restaurant near Engetsu Island

53
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,550
from about 10:30 to 12:00.

54
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,450
Oh, the parking lot where a woman was standing

55
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,150
calling out to the customers.

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,650
The shop where Engetsu Island is in view, right?

57
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,650
Yes, that's right.

58
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,550
At first, I was sketching in the vacant lot

59
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,950
where Marine Palace used to be.

60
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,450
Right inside the tunnel from the Memorial hall.

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,950
A tunnel?

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,450
Back there...

63
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,850
Maki was the one who told you about

64
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,550
the vacant lot where Marine Palace used to be too, right?

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,650
That's right.

66
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,850
Because I didn't want to be bothered.

67
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,050
But somehow I didn't feel like drawing,

68
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,150
so I went to drink a cup of coffee to refresh myself

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,750
and ended up eating lunch there.

70
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,350
So, you didn't draw anything?

71
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,150
Nope, not at all.

72
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,950
I was sketching at the beach from afternoon.

73
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,150
You mean the one on the way to the Memorial Hall?

74
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,450
But from there,

75
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,850
you can only get a side view of Engetsu lsland, right?

76
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,950
Why didn't you sketch from the rocky area

77
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,850
where you could get a frontal view of Engetsu Island?

78
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,450
I didn't want to draw anything

79
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,750
that resembled picture postcards.

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,250
That's what art is all about!

81
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,850
Don't ask such silly questions!

82
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,550
By the way, Ms. Miyahara,

83
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,050
we found in Ms. Maki Shinjou's caller ID records

84
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,350
that you were the last person to have called her.

85
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,350
Yes, I called her.

86
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,550
I was wondering how she was.

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,950
But since she didn't answer, I hung up.

88
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,350
And now, Mr. Fuji.

89
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,950
I was at Adventure World

90
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,250
from 10:26 to about 11:00.

91
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,150
I think I was watching the Marine show.

92
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,850
Do you have any witnesses?

93
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,250
I didn't run into anyone,

94
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,450
but I took a picture using my digital camera.

95
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,350
Would you like me to connect it to the TV set?

96
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,450
What?

97
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,050
You mean you can do something like that with a digital camera?

98
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,050
This is the picture that Maki sent me this morning.

99
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,650
She sent it first to Kanako, Yura and Madoka,

100
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,350
then me, in that order.

101
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
After this,

102
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,550
I took several more pictures inside Adventure World.

103
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,650
Then, I watched the seal, dolphin, and orca shows

104
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,250
that were 30 minutes each.

105
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,650
See, from here.

106
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,450
It's the show that we saw, isn't it?

107
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,250
Yes! We saw the one from 11:00.

108
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,750
Then, we just missed each other.

109
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,650
That's it!

110
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,150
But could there be a possibility

111
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,150
that he took the next orca and dolphin show?

112
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,250
Just what do you mean by that?

113
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,950
In other words, if he takes a picture of the seal show from 9:30 to 10:00,

114
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,350
and then takes the next dolphin show from 11:30,

115
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,150
it would serve as his alibi from 10:00 to 11:30.

116
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,250
I see!

117
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,450
I don't think so.

118
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,750
I think that's an interesting deduction,

119
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,050
but she's not the same woman we saw.

120
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,950
Oh, you're right.

121
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,650
The person we saw had braids.

122
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,150
Which means that Mr. Fuji has a perfect alibi.

123
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,650
But why didn't you take a picture of the orca Show until 1:15 pm

124
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,550
after taking the orca Show before 11:00?

125
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,050
The next picture is the one that you took

126
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,150
when you saw us at 1:15 pm, isn't it?

127
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,950
Isn't it strange that you didn't take any pictures

128
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,050
for a period of more than 2 hours and 15 minutes?

129
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,350
That's because I was riding jet coasters, and having meals.

130
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,350
Besides, I had nothing that I wanted to take during that time.

131
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,750
I tell you, cut out your stupid questions!

132
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,350
Please let me copy your pictures on your driver's license,

133
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,850
so I can go verify what you just testified.

134
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,050
I'm pretty sure

135
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,250
that my intuition is correct.

136
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,450
If so, what's with the pictures taken by the digital camera?

137
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,050
Wait a second.

138
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,750
A laptop?

139
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,150
Maybe...

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,250
May I go outside for a while?

141
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,050
Okay, but keep away from dangerous places.

142
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,150
Okay.

143
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,550
"Adventure World"

144
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,150
Excuse me, I left just a while ago,

145
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,750
but may I go back in again?

146
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,750
My father is inside.

147
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
Okay,

148
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,450
I guess you didn't get your hand stamped when you went out.

149
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,650
What?

150
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,250
A stamp?

151
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,850
Okay.

152
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,950
I got a hold of one evidence!

153
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,250
What? Down with a fever?

154
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,850
Right, that's why we're so busy.

155
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,250
Just as I thought.

156
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,950
Why did Maki go to Sandanbeki where Madoka was

157
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,450
after she saw us at Shirahama Station?

158
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,750
Moreover, the greatest mystery yet is

159
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,250
that I still can't figure out who killed Maki.

160
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,650
Just one more time.

161
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,750
Please let me ride the Adventure Coaster, okay?

162
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,550
My goodness.

163
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,350
Will you promise to study when we get home?

164
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,950
I will, I will! I promise!

165
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,950
Okay then, just one more time!

166
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,850
All right!

167
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,450
That boy's not going to study for beans.

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,250
I see, so that's what happened.

169
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,650
If so, everything's been solved.

170
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,350
No doubt about it.

171
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,250
That person's the killer!

172
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,660
I'm sure that person is the killer,

173
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,760
but I have no proof.

174
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Oh, goodness!

175
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,560
Today is really hot, and it's already the time of day!

176
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,060
I see!

177
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,360
This was a blind spot for men!

178
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,160
I've found a conclusive evidence!

179
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Hey, aren't you the boy staying with Mr. Mouri?

180
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
Oh, officer.

181
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,360
Why are you here?

182
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,860
Did you come to verify the time of the Marine Show, too?

183
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,660
Yes, just to be sure.

184
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,760
Mr. Mouri said that he wanted you

185
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
to check on something else, too.

186
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,060
What? Mr. Mouri said so?

187
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,260
First of all, Mr. Yura

188
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,160
was witnessed sketching right through from about 09:00 to after 11:00

189
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,460
by the life guard who was on duty at the beach park.

190
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,960
Next, as for Ms. Miyahara,

191
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,060
we were able to get testimony from the people at the restaurant.

192
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,260
You're the one with the problem, Mr. Fuji

193
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,660
What?

194
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,860
We questioned the trainer and found out

195
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,260
that the same members have been on duty all day today.

196
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,860
Nevertheless, a person that was not even there today

197
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,960
was taken on your digital camera!

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,860
Well, that's because...

199
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,760
Mr. Fuji, you left Adventure World once, didn't you?

200
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
No use lying about it,

201
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,160
because all we have to do

202
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,660
is use this black light to disclose that you did!

203
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,960
What is that?

204
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,460
Come on, Mr. Mouri,

205
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,160
let's cut out that horse play.

206
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,660
You're the one who told us to check on it.

207
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,060
Please go ahead.

208
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,560
Please show me your right hand.

209
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,460
Some letters have appeared?

210
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,860
Mr. Fuji, the mark

211
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,060
is stamped on your hand for those who want to re-enter

212
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,360
when you leave Adventure World temporarily.

213
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,560
The pictures I just showed you were the edited version

215
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,160
of the ones that I had taken when I came to Adventure World before.

216
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,360
I edited them with my laptop.

217
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
And just why did you do something like that?

218
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,960
That's...

219
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,860
You're going out with Ms. Madoka, right, Mr Fuji?

220
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,160
What?

221
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,860
What a thing to say! Ms. Madoka is...

222
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,060
Mr. Fuji, you left Adventure World at about 09:50

223
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,360
to see Ms. Madoka who was at Sandanbeki, didn't you?

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,360
And you stopped over at Shirahama Station on the way, right?

225
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,860
But, sonny,

226
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,160
why would he go from Adventure World to Shirahama Station

227
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,860
that is in the opposite direction from Sandanbeki?

228
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,360
He went to buy the key holder that Madoka wanted.

229
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,860
See, the one that is on that bag.

230
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,760
Sour Boy that is only sold at the shop at the station.

231
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,960
That's when you saw Ms. Maki, right, Mr. Fuji?

232
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,360
That's why...

233
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,260
I was really surprised back then.

234
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,560
I didn't think I would run into her in the place like that.

235
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,060
Maki!

236
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Thanks again!

237
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,060
To top things off, I run into all of you too, Mr. Mouri.

238
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,160
I didn't want anybody to find out

239
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,360
that I was going out with Madoka.

240
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,060
Especially when it came to Maki and Yura.

241
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,760
I knew.

242
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,060
That's why I went to see Madoka part way, too.

243
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,960
What?

244
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,160
I got to Sandanbeki a little before 12:00.

245
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,560
But you weren't there,

246
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,160
and that key holder was hanging from the easel.

247
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
We were having lunch then.

248
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,160
I sensed right away that you were with Fuji.

249
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,060
That's why you threw away the bottle with sand in it, right?

250
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,460
The sand of White Sand Beach?

251
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
You got it for me?

252
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,960
Because I said that I wanted to take it home?

253
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,160
So, you found it.

254
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,560
It cracked just like my broken heart.

255
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,360
Why did you keep something so important hidden?

256
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,460
Now, now. Let's calm down a bit here, Mr. Mouri.

257
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
Which means you took those pictures with your digital camera

258
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
just so that you could show your friends

259
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,860
that you had an alibi of not being with Ms. Madoka?

260
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,560
Yes, almost as if I were playing a game...

261
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm really sorry about it.

262
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,360
But how did you figure it out, Conan?

263
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,560
How did you find out that I was going out with her?

264
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Because you were the very first person that Ms. Madoka called

265
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,260
to report what had happened to Ms. Maki

266
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,960
when it would've been more natural for her to call Mr. Yura, right?

267
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,660
Besides, when we got to Sandanbeki,

268
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,260
you knew where Ms. Madoka was sketching.

269
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,860
That's why I thought maybe you had already seen her today.

270
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,260
-Oh, I see. -No!

271
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,060
Maki happened to see you together with Madoka,

272
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,160
so in order to contain the secret,

273
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,160
you decided to shut her up!

274
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,460
Southern White Sand Beach...

275
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,960
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Mourl?

276
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,060
Don't tell me that...

277
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,560
This is the rumored, "Sleeping Kogoro" pose!

278
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,660
Now,

279
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,360
Mr. Fuji has absolutely nothing to do

280
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,060
with the incident that had happened.

281
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,460
He's not involved?

282
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,660
The main point of this case is

283
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,960
that there was a switch of the main characters part way.

284
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,860
The victim of the murder

285
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,960
which was supposed to have been Madoka had also switched to Maki.

286
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,060
Let me explain.

287
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
First of all,

288
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,360
Maki who was angry at Madoka for taking her lover away,

289
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,460
hated her and schemed to kill her.

290
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,260
Maki was scheming to kill me?

291
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,660
And she chose Sandanbeki as the place to carry out her plan.

292
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,760
However,

293
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,660
since Maki had a motive to kill,

294
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,060
she decided to make herself an allbl.

295
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,460
She let that person pretend to be her

296
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,860
and made her do something that caught the eyes of people

297
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,260
at Shirahama Station.

298
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,960
Does that mean she had an accomplice?

299
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,160
Right.

300
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,360
Maki who ran into us at Shirahama Station

301
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,760
thought of setting up us as witnesses.

302
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,660
That's why Maki asked us for our schedule.

303
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,260
She set it up so that we would arrive at Shirahama Station

304
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,360
at 10:00 today.

305
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,260
However, Maki's accomplice had other plans.

306
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,860
Other plans?

307
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,160
That plan was to switch Maki's alibi

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,460
and kill her.

309
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,060
Wait, dad!

310
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,160
Then, the Ms. Maki that we saw at Shirahama Station

311
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,760
at about 10:10 was...

312
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,160
Yes, it's an imposter.

313
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,460
The imposter wore a wig, hat, sunglasses and even make-up

314
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,960
just like Maki's.

315
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,460
And this imposter

316
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,560
had probably already killed Maki at around 09:25 at Sandanbeki

317
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,360
before coming to Shirahama Station.

318
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,660
What? 35 minutes before we met her?

319
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,960
Who is that imposter anyway, Mr. Mouri?

320
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,160
A person who was trusted enough

321
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,760
to be asked to be an accomplice in committing the murder

322
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,460
as well as disguise herself to look just like Makl.

323
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,460
There is only one person among the four that is capable of doing this.

324
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,860
Ms. Kanako Miyahara,

325
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,760
only you could've done it.

326
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,660
Me?

327
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,960
But, Mr. Mouri,

328
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Kanako already told Maki yesterday

329
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,160
that she would not listen to Maki anymore!

330
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,460
Well, that's what Maki told her to say

331
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,360
so that the police wouldn't suspect her saying

332
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,560
that Kanako was only making up an alibi

333
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,960
because she was forced to say what she did.

334
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,160
This morning, after Maki dropped everyone off at their destination,

335
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,260
she returned to Engetsu Island,

336
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,760
and made Kanako get into her car.

337
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,860
Kanako disguised herself as Maki as they drove along.

338
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,960
According to Maki's plan,

339
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,960
she was supposed to get off at the inner alley of Sandanbeki

340
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,860
which after, Kanako drives to Shirahama Station.

341
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,960
Then after her alibi was established,

342
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,860
Maki was supposed to kill Madoka.

343
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,960
I see!

344
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,860
That's why there were working gloves in Maki Shinjou's jacket.

345
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,460
Right!

346
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,760
She was going to use them when committing the crime.

347
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,160
However, Maki's plan suddenly shatters to pieces.

348
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
After committing the murder,

349
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,760
Kanako took Maki's knife and wallet.

350
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,060
She did this to make it Iook like a murder-robbery!

351
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,760
She then speeds along

352
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
and arrived at Shirahama Station a little before we got there.

353
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,260
Then, she observed us

354
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,060
and waited for the right time to appear before us.

355
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,160
Which means that

356
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,760
when Conan said that he felt as if he was being watched...

357
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,860
Right! It was Kanako.

358
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,660
After that you made us witness Maki at around 10:10.

359
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,060
Then you went to Sanjo Shrine

360
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,860
while at the same time getting rid of the evidence.

361
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,260
Then, you abandoned the car and went back to Engetsu Island.

362
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,860
Please wait!

363
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,260
Do you have any grounds for saying all of this?

364
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,560
Of course!

365
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,960
Although you mentioned not wanting be bothered by others,

366
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,260
you went out of your way to choose a beach

367
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,360
where there were a lot of tourists and began sketching.

368
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Fearing the estimated time of death being extended to a later time,

369
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
you called Maki to make Madoka realize as soon as possible

370
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,260
that Maki was lying dead on the ground.

371
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,860
That's only forced interpretation!

372
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,060
If you insist that I'm the killer, show me proof!

373
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,860
If I'm not mistaken,

374
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Maki was using make-up that she ordered from Paris, wasn't she?

375
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,960
Huh?

376
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,210
You may have been able to get a hold of the clothes

377
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,510
that Maki wore or the bags she carried in Japan

378
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,410
but as for the characteristic color lipstick that she used,

379
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,110
you could find no substitute here.

380
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,710
And your saliva was found on that lipstick.

381
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,110
The saliva of the last person who used it, which is you.

382
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,310
Moreover,

383
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,510
Maki's lipstick that you could not wipe off completely

384
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,410
is still on your lips.

385
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,410
Under Mr. Mouri's orders,

386
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,410
we have already received the results of the forensic analysis

387
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,110
of Ms. Maki Shinjou's lipstick.

388
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,410
Would you like me to explain in detail

389
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,610
on saliva and blood type?

390
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,910
No, thank you.

391
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,310
I am aware of that amount of medical knowledge, too.

392
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,710
When did you figure out that I was the killer?

393
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,610
It took me quite a while to put my fingers on you.

394
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,610
I did have a hunch that it was one of you.

395
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,510
But when I found the key holder near the dead body...

396
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,510
Key holder?

397
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,110
Maki had the rental car key

398
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,110
attached to the key holder together with her house keys, didn't she?

399
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,010
But the key of the rental car key was missing from that key holder.

400
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,510
That's because Maki...

401
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,010
Yes.

402
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,310
A robber would've taken the key holder

403
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,210
because Maki's key holder was not the hook type key holder,

404
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,010
but the coil type that is harder to remove the key from.

405
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,010
So, I'm sure that Maki gave you the key to the car

406
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,210
after she removed it from the key holder.

407
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,310
Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

408
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,010
I've completely lost.

409
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,110
But, Kanako, why did you?

410
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,210
I entered the university illegally.

411
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,510
Huh?

412
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,110
I asked Maki's father to get me in.

413
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,310
After I got in,

414
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,310
Maki threatened to disclose what happened if I didn't listen to her.

415
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,210
That's why I kept following her orders all this time.

416
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,610
I wanted to be freed

417
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,010
from Maki.

418
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,410
I guess we'll be able to get back to Tokyo by tonight somehow.

419
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,110
Yes, it's time to say goodbye to White Sand Beach, too.

420
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,910
I'm so sleepy that I can't stand it.

421
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,710
Then, have some of this.

422
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,510
A pickled plum.

423
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,410
Sour!

424
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,610
I'm awake!

425
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,610
Only if this could also awaken your talent as a detective.

426
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,480
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,220
"Sushi"

428
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,400
Osaka is the stage for the next episode.

429
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,940
Crab, radish and shellfish,

430
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,140
the three "Ks" of sushi.
