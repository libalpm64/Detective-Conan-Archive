1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,570
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,770
The bright lights of Broadway,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,270
Ran, mother and I work on a big case.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,010
After the case in Chinatown at Yokohama was solved,

9
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,810
Ran suddenly collapsed and in her delirium,

10
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,010
she recalls a case from the past.

11
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,010
The case was when Mom finagled us

12
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,610
into going with her to see a musical in New York.

13
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,510
Waiting for us in front of the theater was Sharon Vineyard.

14
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,510
A famous actress and also mother's very close friend.

15
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,210
She was going to give us the backstage tour

16
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,010
but as we walked through the wings before the show.

17
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,010
What's that on the ceiling?

18
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,710
Oh, that. They're stage costumes.

19
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,310
They have them suspended up there so it doesn't get in the way.

20
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,010
Look out!

21
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,110
Armor!

22
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,610
Ran!

23
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,810
Ran!

24
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,310
"Shinichi In New York (Part 2)"

25
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,510
Hang in there, Ran.

26
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,310
We're almost there.

27
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,910
We're almost at the hospital, Ran.

28
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,910
Ran!

29
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,910
Are you all right, Ran?

30
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,810
I knew it was me.

31
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,810
Somebody wants to kill me!

32
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,710
I don't think so.

33
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,510
The rope snapped because it was worn out.

34
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,310
All right, who did this? Who hung that thing up there?

35
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,810
Things could've been worse, though.

36
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,610
We were lucky that huge mirror over there didn't break.

37
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,710
You're right, that mirror's our guardian angel.

38
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,610
What are you girls talking about?

39
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,510
You don't owe that mirror or an angel any thanks.

40
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,710
You should thank her.

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,210
Thank you. I owe you my life!

42
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,210
It was nothing.

43
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,210
Hey, we should be getting ready by now.

44
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,910
We'll see you in our dressing room after the show then.

45
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,910
Okay.

46
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,710
I must've scrapped it.

47
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,110
Let's see, a bandage. Do I have a bandage?

48
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,410
Here.

49
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,710
I was right, there is no God, after all.

50
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,910
If there was, things wouldn't have turned out so unfairly.

51
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,210
Yukiko, I'm going home.

52
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,710
Weren't you going to watch the show?

53
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,310
Yes, I had intended to

54
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,010
but something important's come up.

55
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,310
Besides, I've heard it's going to storm tonight so I'm canceling.

56
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,510
This is great.

57
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,910
I knew you'd like it.

58
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,810
You don't see musicals of such grand scale in Japan.

59
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,610
But there seems to be one kid who doesn't feel the way we do.

60
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,510
Listen, you. We've come all this way,

61
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,510
the least you could do is pay attention to what's going on.

62
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,810
What's so great about this anyway?

63
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,510
They've just taken a Greek myth and fixed it up into a romantic comedy.

64
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,810
All right, then. What's the Greek myth it's based on?

65
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,810
The Golden Apple.

66
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,110
A long time ago, there were 3 goddesses.

67
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,610
Hera, Athena and Aphrodite.

68
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,210
They had been invited to a banquet

69
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,510
but there was another goddess named Eris who wasn't,

70
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,510
and filled with jealousy, she sent them a golden apple.

71
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,910
With a message reading "To the most beautiful goddess".

72
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,310
What? Isn't that just like...

73
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,210
Yeah, and the three goddesses

74
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,910
decided to let the prince of Troy

75
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,810
choose which one was the most beautiful.

76
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,010
And each vied for his vote by telling him

77
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,010
what they'd give him for choosing them,

78
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,710
that actor we just met,

79
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,810
playing the poor prince, he's the Prince of Troy.

80
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,810
The actress playing the rich man's wife is Zeus's wife,

81
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,810
Hera, the goddess of marriage who promised

82
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,710
to make him the most powerful man on Earth.

83
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,510
That headstrong looking Japanese actress

84
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,110
is Athena. The goddess of wisdom

85
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,610
who promised to make him victorious in battle.

86
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,310
That sexy actress is the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite

87
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,310
who promised to give him the most beautiful woman in the world,

88
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,510
and the gloomy-looking actress in the previous scene

89
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,610
is the one who was jealous of the three.

90
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,310
The one who sent them the golden apples,

91
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,810
Eris, the goddess of discord, even their names sound similar.

92
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,010
But in this play, money is power,

93
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,210
and work is the battle,

94
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,310
and romance is the beautiful woman,

95
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,210
and the golden apple has been transformed

96
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,010
into a necklace of jewels.

97
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,910
And then? So who did he choose?

98
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,710
Aphrodite, of course!

99
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,210
But that was what eventually caused the battle of Troy.

100
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:03,010
But that's a Greek myth, this musical is a little different,

101
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,610
you're going to be surprised

102
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,810
when you see who that sorry-looking poor prince really is.

103
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,910
Look! You poor souls.

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,010
My name is Michael.

105
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,310
Michael? Does he mean the angel, Michael?

106
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,310
He's got to be kidding.

107
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,910
You must heed my words.

108
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,210
What?

109
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,010
Heath.

110
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,610
It can't be...

111
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,710
You're right. He's probably playing...

112
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,410
No, he's not playing.

113
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,810
He's dead.

114
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,910
A gun?

115
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,210
Somebody shot him?

116
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,210
Yes, it looks that way.

117
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,710
I think it'd be best if we got away from here, too.

118
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,010
Mom, take care of Ran!

119
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,310
Shin!

120
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,810
Darn it.

121
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,810
I knew I'd be too late.

122
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,710
A bullet casing?

123
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,110
This is...

124
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,660
What in the world?

125
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I never thought it'd be Heath who'd been shot.

126
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,860
Do you know him, Captain?

127
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,160
My wife's a big fan of his.

128
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,760
What happened?

129
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,560
The performers are waiting in their dressing rooms

130
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,060
but the audience all ran off.

131
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,160
He took a bullet in the chest,

132
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,160
it's embedded in the wings on his back.

133
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,660
The wings on his back? Oh, you mean this?

134
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
From the angle of the entry wound,

135
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,360
I'd say he was shot from above at a 40 degree angle.

136
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,960
40 degrees? That's pretty high up.

137
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
Of course it is!

138
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,860
The shooter was up there in the balcony seat.

139
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
And he used a laser sight.

140
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,660
Night Baroness.

141
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,760
Well, if it isn't Yukiko.

142
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,060
And why are you here?

143
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,460
I just happened to watch the show.

144
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,360
I never dreamed the musical would turn into a mystery, though.

145
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,460
He was shot during the climax where the angel appears,

146
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,360
the fireworks went off and smoke filled the stage.

147
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,160
The image of the angel in the mirror slides up and at the same time,

148
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,360
Heath, dressed as the angel rises up from behind.

149
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,460
It was meant to look surreal,

150
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
like he had actually flown out the mirror.

151
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,060
So what you're saying is the shooter shot him from the balcony

152
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,460
as he flew up from behind the mirror.

153
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,660
That's right. And then the shooter threw the gun onto the stage

154
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,160
to cause a panic,

155
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,660
that way, the shooter could get away in the chaos.

156
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,360
Are you sure about that?

157
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,860
About the shooter being in the balcony, I mean.

158
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Of course I am.

159
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,460
Thanks to all the smoke on the stage.

160
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,060
I clearly saw a red beam

161
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,460
leading from the balcony to the stage.

162
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,960
Besides, I think my son saw it, too.

163
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,060
Your son?

164
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,660
Yes, he's standing right beside you.

165
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,760
What?

166
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,460
He's the real thing?

167
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,660
Is this your son, Shinichi, the one you're always bragging about?

168
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Yes, isn't he the splitting image of Yusaku?

169
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,260
And they're both so mischievous, too!

170
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,660
Captain, may I have a word?

171
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,160
What is it?

172
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Shin, can't you behave yourself?

173
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,660
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,560
Yukiko, it seems you were right.

175
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,860
There was a suspicious person

176
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,760
who bought that seat a month ago in advance.

177
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,460
And it seems they couldn't distinguish whether it was a male or female,

178
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,360
Since the person wore a scarf and hat.

179
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,460
That's the shooter. No doubt about it.

180
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,160
But why that seat?

181
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,760
Is that a good seat? Is it expensive?

182
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,460
That seat's at an angle. It's not a very good seat,

183
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,660
that's why it's cheaper.

184
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,260
If someone came with their face hidden

185
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,460
and specifically requested that seat,

186
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,560
they'd leave a lasting impression.

187
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
That's exactly what the shooter would want.

188
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,760
I don't understand.

189
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,260
What are these two strange marks on the deceased's body?

190
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,160
Strange marks?

191
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,760
Yes, on his neck, don't they look like burn marks?

192
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,660
And there's blood on his right hand.

193
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,160
Maybe he got it when he grabbed his chest after he got shot.

194
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,260
No, what puzzles me is the blood on his palm is smeared.

195
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,860
It probably got smeared when he touched something

196
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
after getting the blood on his hand

197
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,660
but there's no blood on his clothes

198
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,860
and it wasn't possible for him to touch anything

199
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,160
while he was hanging in mid-air.

200
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
I don't think even you, Night Baroness can solve that riddle.

201
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,860
No, I can't, not yet.

202
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,760
Then, let's ask Yusaku.

203
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,260
I'm sure he'd know.

204
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,860
No, Yusaku's holed up in a hotel room in Los Angeles now.

205
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,660
That's too bad.

206
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
A famous actor's been murdered, what a mess.

207
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,460
The murderer got away

208
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,060
and on top of that, we don't have a single clue.

209
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,160
There's no telling what the people and the Chief will say,

210
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,460
not to mention my wife.

211
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,660
Excuse me.

212
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,560
Then, why don't you let Shinichi solve this?

213
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,660
Let Shin do it?

214
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
No way. Impossible.

215
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,060
He's still a child

216
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,060
and this is a real murder we're talking about.

217
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,060
But Shinichi solved the crime that happened in the airplane.

218
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,260
Sure, I'll bet that after the criminal was caught,

219
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,860
he whispered, "I knew it, it's just as I thought", didn't he?

220
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,360
No, he was involved in the investigation from the very start.

221
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,860
He was?

222
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,960
Yes, and in the end, he got all the suspects together

223
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,660
and smugly began to solve the crime,

224
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,260
he acted like he was Holmes or Poirot or something.

225
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,860
My Shin did that?

226
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,660
The murderer is one of those four actresses?

227
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,260
I don't believe it.

228
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,560
Right after the shooting,

229
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,960
I went up to the balcony seat and I found this bullet casing,

230
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,260
it wasn't hot, it proves someone Ieft it there beforehand.

231
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,660
But you saw it too, didn't you?

232
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,260
There was a red beam from that balcony seat to the stage.

233
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Yes, that's what it looked like,

234
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,260
but there's no way we could tell

235
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,560
where that beam came from and where it was directed.

236
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,260
That's right.

237
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,560
That beam probably came from the stage. Not from the balcony.

238
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It was to make us think it was coming from up there.

239
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,760
What I'm trying to say is,

240
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,260
the person who hid their face to reserve that seat

241
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,260
and the strange package that arrived

242
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,960
was all a ruse to make us think

243
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,060
someone was after the actresses.

244
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,960
Really?

245
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,660
I see.

246
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,660
And of course, this is part of it too.

247
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,860
This is where that suit of armor fell just before the show started.

248
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,060
Look at the floor.

249
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,860
There's thin fishing line tied to the nail,

250
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
and there are markings on the floor beside it,

251
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,460
it looks like something was cut.

252
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,560
And there's a fishing line on the suit of armor that fell, too.

253
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,160
Are you saying somebody did this deliberately?

254
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,960
That's right, the culprit probably had a blade

255
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,560
or some kind attached to their shoe and used it to cut the line

256
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,260
causing the armor to fall.

257
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,560
The culprit knew that Sharon's friends,

258
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,760
that's us, would pass through here

259
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,660
during our backstage tour.

260
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,060
Which means, the culprit

261
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,760
is someone who was here to drop the armor,

262
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,760
and was also one of the performers on stage with Heath,

263
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,360
that way she could aim the beam at the balcony

264
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,960
then shoot him.

265
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,660
Anyone of those four actresses could have done it.

266
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
But he's 6'3 tall.

267
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,960
All of them are under 6'.

268
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,660
How could anyone of them shoot him from overhead

269
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,360
when he is taller than them

270
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
and on top of that, he was behind the mirror.

271
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,460
Yes, he's right. Explain that, Shin!

272
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,160
I haven't figured that out yet.

273
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I see.

274
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,060
Lila, where you telling me the truth just now?

275
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,760
Yes, Heath and I were seeing each other,

276
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,860
we had been for about 5 years.

277
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,760
Then you knew he was also going out with me, too.

278
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,960
Will you two calm down?

279
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,360
Must you talk about that today of all days?

280
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Hey, now.

281
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,660
I'd think you'd be the most upset about this.

282
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,060
Your boyfriend has 2 other girlfriends.

283
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,060
You mean you too, Rose?

284
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,160
Were you dating him, too?

285
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,660
I see.

286
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,760
Those four do seem to have a motive for killing Heath.

287
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,860
Why?

288
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,460
I know he was dating the three of them,

289
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,060
but Everess doesn't seem to be involved with him.

290
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,660
Unlike the others,

291
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,360
she doesn't have a photo of him on her mirror.

292
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,360
The truth is Everess and Heath are married.

293
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,160
What?

294
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,760
Sharon told me secretly

295
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,860
when we were being given the backstage tour.

296
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,360
She said it was a secret

297
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,560
because his popularity would drop if it became public.

298
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,060
So that's why she hated him

299
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,560
because he was dating the other three?

300
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,360
But what we have to figure out is,

301
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,060
how he was shot from above?

302
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,460
Rose was the closest to the mirror,

303
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,660
but, she was on the ground, acting the part of a startled woman.

304
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,360
Everess was staggering.

305
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,760
Akane was on her knees praying.

306
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,960
The only one able to shoot him from above

307
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,060
was Lila who was standing and clutching her head,

308
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,560
but unlike the others who were hidden by the smoke,

309
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,460
Lila's hands were in plain view,

310
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,360
everyone would have seen her take a gun out.

311
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,460
Do you think it's possible Heath bent down?

312
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,060
I doubt it, those wings were foot operated

313
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,860
and rigged so he couldn't bend down.

314
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Hey, Shinichi.

315
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,660
Have you come up with something?

316
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,960
Hey, Shinichi. Wait a minute.

317
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,360
You've figured it out, haven't you?

318
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,860
Don't keep me in suspense, tell me about it.

319
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,260
Hey, Ran. How tall you are?

320
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
160 centimeters.

321
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,360
That'd be 5'3.

322
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,860
This pamphlet is about 12 inches,

323
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,560
so that's one feet.

324
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,260
I hate to ask but can you put this on your head

325
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,560
and stand in front of the mirror?

326
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,960
What?

327
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,960
What's this supposed to prove, Shinichi?

328
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,360
What are you going to do?

329
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,860
Clues...

330
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,660
I'm looking for a clue.

331
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
A clue?

332
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,260
See, up over there.

333
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,160
There's a small crack.

334
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,260
That's strange. This mirror's been with the troupe for years,

335
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,760
it's their guardian spirit.

336
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,660
Sharon told me they took good care of it

337
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,860
because they thought it'd be bad Iuck if it got cracked.

338
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,560
Hey, what's this?

339
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,860
It looks like it's been patched!

340
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,860
Are you sure they took good care of this?

341
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,760
Don't you think this curtain's a little crooked?

342
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,060
Somebody might've bumped into it when they were trying to get to safety.

343
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,360
Hey, Shinichi, let's go back already.

344
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,860
We're going to get scolded.

345
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,960
A feather?

346
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
How'd it get stuck here?

347
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,060
This cover of the floor isn't used for anything.

348
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,560
Blood.

349
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,460
I get it now.

350
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,960
The killer used that certain stage prop to commit the crime.

351
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,860
This bloody crime

352
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,760
was committed by someone like that sneaky goddess Eris.

353
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,300
Next Conan's Hint:

354
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,340
"Trap Door"

355
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,240
Ran, the next hint really burns me up.

356
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,820
I knew it, you've got animal instinct.
