1
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:07,038
Taken by Nanami Kyodo, Ran's senior in the karate club,

2
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,338
we the members of the Detective Squad

3
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:12,238
came to treasure-hunt at the Kyodo residence.

4
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:14,038
The mansion of the Kyodo's

5
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:18,038
was built by the hands of Seitaro Kyodo,

6
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:19,638
and because he used to always get carried away with what he does,

7
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,938
the mansion was full of tricks and gadgets.

8
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,338
The Dark Tower, a mysterious building, is one of them,

9
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:28,838
not having any entrance or windows.

10
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:33,038
While Nanami guided us around the house,

11
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:35,338
we suddenly heard a woman screaming.

12
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,038
It's Mom's voice!

13
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:43,038
Mom! Mom!

14
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,938
Children, stay away!

15
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,838
What?

16
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,138
Momoe! Momoe!

17
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:51,238
What's going on?

18
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:56,138
It looks like she fell off the tower.

19
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,438
But this tower...

20
00:00:58,438 --> 00:00:59,938
Doesn't have an entrance.

21
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:02,738
There's no way she could've made it up there!

22
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:07,338
Since we deduced that the culprit may still be in the tower,

23
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:09,038
we started investigations

24
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,838
to look for the entrance of the tower,

25
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,038
but Ai disappears part way through!

26
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:15,638
Ai's gone!

27
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:16,938
What?

28
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:19,338
Hey, Ai!

29
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:22,438
-Ai! -Ai!

30
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:26,038
There's wind coming from the space.

31
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,438
Ai!

32
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:33,938
Gosh. There's got be an entrance elsewhere!

33
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:36,338
Next door is the liquor storeroom.

34
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:38,638
It smells of liquor!

35
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:41,338
I'm used it because of Dad!

36
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:43,138
There's a mirror!

37
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:45,838
Why would it be left standing in a place like this?

38
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,038
Standing it there is just sham.

39
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:51,738
I disappeared. There's no other way to put it.

40
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:54,838
This smell...

41
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,438
If you sniff it too much, you'll really get drunk.

42
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,638
No, I smell the lady's perfume.

43
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:03,738
Her smell is all over this area.

44
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:06,738
What's up?

45
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:08,238
Disappeared!

46
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:11,438
The ceiling is reflected in the mirror but we're not?

47
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,038
It switched to a screen!

48
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,238
Rubber tape?

49
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:16,738
A person can go under it!

50
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,938
It's the entrance to the treasure! Let's go!

51
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,138
We'll be in trouble if the culprit is there!

52
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:25,738
Hey!

53
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:27,338
What shall we do?

54
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:29,838
What shall we do, Conan?

55
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:37,538
Ai?

56
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:38,938
Ai!

57
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:41,038
It's not like her to scream like that.

58
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,438
I'll be right over!

59
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,338
Stay here, Ayumi!

60
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:47,238
-No. I'm going to rescue her! -Don't!

61
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,238
Okay, let's go!

62
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,938
Don't ever let go of my hand.

63
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,638
Okay!

64
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,938
The vivid colored memories of summer

65
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:15,038
solve mysteries all season round.

66
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:16,938
Search for the treasure to a miracle world.

67
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:19,338
The truth of light in an eerie tower.

68
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,938
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,838
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,238
His name is Detective Conan!

71
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:11,958
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 2)"

72
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:22,258
Mr. Tsutomu Kyodo, you are the person who discovered the body?

73
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,458
Yes, it seems so.

74
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,658
What were you doing there?

75
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,658
-Watercress. -What?

76
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:31,858
I was gathering watercress to use for cooking.

77
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,258
It is cultivated by hydroponic method

78
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,158
in the stream below the tower.

79
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:37,558
I see.

80
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:41,558
That "blue" (green) color of the watercress stimulates the appetite.

81
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,758
How strange.

82
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:48,058
Were the members of the Youth Detective Squad found?

83
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,358
Nanami.

84
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:52,058
I'm calling Conan right now, but...

85
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,758
Nobody saw them go out the gate.

86
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:58,758
Don't tell me that they went off on the treasure-hunt on their own?

87
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,158
Dad!

88
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:06,458
"Nagase Kensaku (75), assistant of the previous head"

89
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,258
What's that sound?

90
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,958
A flood!

91
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,158
Stay calm. It's not for real!

92
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:18,458
Close your eyes!

93
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,058
Hot! It's hot!

94
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:27,158
It's not for real! It's just hot wind blowing!

95
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:28,658
Cool it, Ayumi!

96
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:30,458
Yep. I'll calm down.

97
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,858
When you heard your wife's voice, where were you?

98
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,658
I was somewhere near the rose garden.

99
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:42,058
I went after my wife wanting to convince her one more time.

100
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,058
Could you tell right away

101
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,858
where your wife's voice was coming from?

102
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,758
Huh?

103
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,758
If it's the rose garden, the connecting corridor is near

104
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:50,858
and so is the storeroom.

105
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:54,658
But you ran right for the tower.

106
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,658
That's probably because

107
00:06:56,658 --> 00:07:00,458
I heard the scream coming from somewhere high.

108
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:05,158
That tower is the only tall building in that area.

109
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,358
That's why I thought Momoe fell.

110
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,858
From a tower with no entrance?

111
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:15,858
It was so sudden that it didn't dawn on me.

112
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:18,958
What?

113
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,858
The kid's aren't here?

114
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,058
-Yeah. -I looked all over the house,

115
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,158
but couldn't find them.

116
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:26,158
Maybe they already went home?

117
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:29,458
No. I tried calling, but was told they're not home.

118
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,058
I tell you those kids are hopeless.

119
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,758
Let's go look for them once more!

120
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,058
If we ask Mr. Nagase,

121
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,958
he may know of places I don't know, too.

122
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,258
-Dad, come with us too. -Bad news!

123
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:42,658
Mr. Nagase...

124
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:44,558
Mr. Nagase's gone!

125
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:45,958
What?

126
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,958
We walked pretty much, didn't we?

127
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,458
Yes. I wonder where we are now?

128
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,058
At any rate, I'm not giving up until I find the treasure!

129
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,858
I guess so.

130
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,558
But...

131
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,258
Is this me?

132
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:05,458
Genta, since when did you go on a diet?

133
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,158
Stop making fun of me!

134
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,858
Cut it out!

135
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,658
It's a door?

136
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:15,958
Maybe...

137
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,658
The entrance to the treasure!

138
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:19,958
Over there!

139
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,958
Gosh! Even the door's making fun of me.

140
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,458
I'll catch you!

141
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,258
Gosh!

142
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,458
-You won't get away! -After it!

143
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:34,058
Huh? It's gone.

144
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,958
It got away.

145
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,558
Over there!

146
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,558
How do we open it?

147
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,858
Be careful.

148
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,358
Yep.

149
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,958
Genta, Mitsuhiko!

150
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,658
Are you two okay?

151
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:59,358
-Yeah. -Yes, somehow.

152
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,758
What're you doing?

153
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,658
I'm looking for the switch.

154
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:06,158
Here it is.

155
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,158
-It's starting to open! -Okay!

156
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,058
Somebody's coming!

157
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:17,458
It's the culprit!

158
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,358
Hurry! Conan!

159
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,458
Gosh. Is it broken?

160
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,958
It keeps going back!

161
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,958
Mitsuhiko, you can make it in!

162
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,358
But if I let go now...

163
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,258
That's right! Wait!

164
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,258
Use this pipe!

165
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:42,358
Hurry! The culprit will come!

166
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,458
Okay, run for it!

167
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,158
-Aye! -Yes!

168
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,858
A child's room?

169
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:08,858
It can't be.

170
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,758
But there's a cute doll.

171
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,058
It's glued on.

172
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:14,258
This, too.

173
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,958
And this.

174
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,658
The books in the bookshelf are drawings.

175
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:20,858
But the sofa is for real.

176
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:23,058
What was this room made for?

177
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,258
Don't be deceived. It's only an illusion!

178
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,458
The only thing that's spinning is the wall.

179
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:54,058
Get out of the way.

180
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:05,158
I saw many split images of myself.

181
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:07,958
Is this what Tsutomu's memory is all about?

182
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,358
Genta?

183
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,258
What? The culprit?

184
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,158
A mirror?

185
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:25,058
What is it? Don't scare me.

186
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:30,258
Gosh! Where are you?

187
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,258
Mitsuhiko!

188
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,458
This way!

189
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,458
I thought I just saw the figure of a person.

190
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,458
Is anyone there?

191
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,058
There's no one here, is there?

192
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:06,658
Ouch. Here goes.

193
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:14,358
Ayumi!

194
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,858
Where are you? Where are you, everybody?

195
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,358
Cool it.

196
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,858
Fussing and making big noise is not going to help me find them.

197
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,758
Think...

198
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:28,458
What meaning there is to this tunnel.

199
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,558
And then think it over again.

200
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:36,658
Who of the three could've committed the crime?

201
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:38,058
The fragrance of the perfume

202
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,358
makes you want to deduce that the victim came into the tower.

203
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:44,458
But be it Tsutomu who was right below the tower...

204
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,158
Or Mr. Nozomi Kyodo who was in the yard...

205
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,758
Or Mr. Nagase, who ran over from the main house.

206
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,358
None of them could've had time

207
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:54,658
to push the victim off the roof and come back.

208
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,558
These tools...

209
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:00,758
Wait a sec.

210
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:03,758
Maybe I had it all wrong?

211
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:07,958
The tower and the underground passage

212
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,658
that was built 40 years ago.

213
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:13,658
It's understandable if it breaks or goes rusty.

214
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,258
So...

215
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,258
That's it!

216
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:22,158
This place is...

217
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:29,977
This place is...

218
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,577
It was dimly lit and the ceiling was high.

219
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:38,877
I see! This is the treasure room.

220
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:41,577
Judging from the height, it the Dark Tower.

221
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:44,177
But it's supposed to be round.

222
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:45,977
It is a triangular pyramid.

223
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,677
A mirror.

224
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:54,177
Which means, this is maybe...

225
00:13:55,077 --> 00:14:00,177
Conan nor the children seem to be nowhere in the house.

226
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:02,777
And, of course the same goes for Mr. Nagase.

227
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:05,077
So, the only place left is

228
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,677
the Dark Tower.

229
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:09,977
Nagase knew, didn't he?

230
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:13,177
That Seitaro hid the treasure in the tower.

231
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,077
I still can't believe it.

232
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:18,377
That the treasure that I thought was a dream actually exists.

233
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,377
Who cares about that!

234
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,877
As long the children are okay.

235
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,477
We've got no time to lose.

236
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:29,277
Please cooperate looking for the entrance of the tower!

237
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:33,977
Conan.

238
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,977
According to Tsutomu's story,

239
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:42,077
there should be a button somewhere.

240
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,777
Here it is.

241
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,977
So these are the buttons of three colors.

242
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:50,477
What's this?

243
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,677
The roof.

244
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:56,577
Okay, now I have a good view.

245
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,977
This is...

246
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:03,477
Momoe's fake nail.

247
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:06,477
She must've pressed it really hard.

248
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,477
To the point of her nail coming off...

249
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:10,977
Chief!

250
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,777
Yes, this is Megure.

251
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:16,177
It's just as I've explained, we've got no time to lose!

252
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,777
Please dispatch all the officers you can gather

253
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:21,277
because we must thoroughly investigate the Dark Tower.

254
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,677
What?

255
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:25,177
I don't think you need to dispatch the officers.

256
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,877
Just what do you mean, Conan?

257
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:30,177
Wait a while!

258
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:34,177
The key to the front entrance is...

259
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:35,277
red.

260
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:38,677
Hey, kid! Come back here and explain!

261
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:41,377
What? It's an earthquake!

262
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:43,177
Wrong, Mr. Mouri!

263
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,577
The dark tower is extending upwards!

264
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:52,877
The entrance is over there!

265
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,777
Welcome to the Dark Tower!

266
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:03,677
Hey, kid! Hurry and get down here!

267
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:06,477
Pops! There's something I want to show you.

268
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:08,377
Will you come up here please?

269
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,777
No way!

270
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,677
I wonder if he found the treasure.

271
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,177
-Could be. -Treasure?

272
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,677
I'll go, I'll go! I'll be right there!

273
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,077
Dad.

274
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,277
I thought he didn't like high places.

275
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:24,277
Treasure, treasure!

276
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:27,377
Wait for me, my dear treasure!

277
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,077
Where's the treasure?

278
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:32,077
Watch out!

279
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:38,477
I'm falling!

280
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:45,677
Is he dozing off in a place like that?

281
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,577
How adept.

282
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,377
I'm sorry for troubling you.

283
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:52,577
I've come up with the truth of this case, therefore...

284
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,777
What?

285
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:57,977
Mrs. Kyodo falling to her death was no murder

286
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,877
but rather, an accident.

287
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,577
An accident?

288
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:04,877
Are you saying she tripped or something?

289
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:08,077
Of course, it's not as simple as that.

290
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:11,477
Finding the entrance of the tower, she came up here

291
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,377
and discovered the buttons of three colors.

292
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:18,377
First, I'm sure she opened the door leading to the roof

293
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:20,477
to let the light in.

294
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:22,777
Conan, you're there, aren't you?

295
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,877
Yes, Pops, I'm here!

296
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,577
Okay, got you.

297
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:37,577
And she pushed the button. The blue button.

298
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,177
I would like to let you know that

299
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:43,677
I, myself haven't tested that button yet either.

300
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:45,677
However, I do know that something happened

301
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:49,777
and because of that something, the victim fell off the tower.

302
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,377
I assume that's what happened.

303
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:54,577
Conan, push it, will you?

304
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,777
Yes, sir! The blue button, right?

305
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:06,077
What the? What's happening?

306
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,377
Amazing!

307
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:25,677
It's understandable that she, thinking that there would be treasure

308
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:28,077
was shocked out of her wits and fell to her death.

309
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:29,777
A holograph?

310
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,877
I guess it was considered cutting edge technology back then.

311
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,777
40 years ago?

312
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:38,877
Theoretically, it was known from way in the past,

313
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:40,177
but it was in 1971

314
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:44,177
when hologram using a laser beam was invented.

315
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:47,877
I saw it on TV the other day!

316
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,877
Although very unfortunate,

317
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,877
Mrs. Kyodo, was taken by surprise by the hologram

318
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,777
fell to her death from the roof...

319
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:59,777
I have no choice but to conclude it as a tragic accident.

320
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:04,077
So, Momoe went berserk till the very end.

321
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,577
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

322
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:09,477
How strange, though.

323
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,277
According to Tsutomu's memory, if the blue button is pushed,

324
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,577
the treasure was supposed to appear, right?

325
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:17,077
I heard from Pops

326
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,477
the reason why Mrs. Kyodo pushed the wrong button.

327
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:21,277
What? She made a mistake?

328
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,777
She did push the blue button, right?

329
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:30,077
You called the nice green vegetables blue, right?

330
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:33,377
Getting vegetables ready

331
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,577
is more of an important hobby to me.

332
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,577
You also used "blue" to describe watercress, didn't you?

333
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:43,977
That "blue" (green) color of the watercress stimulates the appetite.

334
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,177
Wrong!

335
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:48,377
When I said blue button, I meant the green one!

336
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:49,577
What?

337
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:50,777
True.

338
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:54,677
There are many people who refer to the color green as blue.

339
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:58,477
But the victim took the word blue literally.

340
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:01,177
I guess you can call this a tragedy

341
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:02,977
caused by the ambiguity of the Japanese language.

342
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:07,277
But if Mom pushed the green button, then what?

343
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:11,877
She would've seen what Seitaro wanted to show Tsutomu.

344
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:15,377
You're all safe after all.

345
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:16,777
Alive and kicking.

346
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:19,277
Mr. Nagase rescued us.

347
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:22,677
He got me out of the elevator that broke down!

348
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:26,677
Mr. Nagase kept trouble down to a minimum for us.

349
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:28,377
I'm sorry

350
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,477
that you had to go through a frightening experience

351
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,677
because I delayed making repairs.

352
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,877
What's with you, Nagase?

353
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:37,977
You mean you knew everything and didn't say a word about it?

354
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:40,277
Seitaro told me.

355
00:20:40,277 --> 00:20:41,477
If I told Nozomi,

356
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:44,277
he would say to demolish it right away.

357
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,477
So, he told me that until the time came for Tsutomu

358
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:48,377
to succeed the family, he would leave it up to me.

359
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:53,977
But Tsutomu has no intention of succeeding the Kyodo family business,

360
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:56,477
forgetting the words he said when he was a child.

361
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,377
If the amusement park inside the tunnel is made public,

362
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:03,377
everbody would really be happy!

363
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,677
When I grow up,

364
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:07,277
I'm going show them this land of dreams!

365
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:10,177
Wanting him to recall those words,

366
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:13,577
I returned to the Dark Tower to make renovations.

367
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:16,077
So, that was the other button?

368
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,877
The green one?

369
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,677
That's right.

370
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:23,877
The last treasure that Seitaro had hidden in the tower.

371
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:26,777
May I push that button?

372
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,477
Wow! Fantastic!

373
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,277
It's a super humongous kaleidoscope!

374
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,977
This is a kaleidoscope? Gigantic!

375
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:22,977
When the oil inside flows,

376
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:26,577
it creates millions and billions of arrays of different patterns.

377
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:29,577
So, this is the dream that Grandpa made.

378
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:32,077
-Dad! -What?

379
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,277
Are you going to destroy all this?

380
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,177
The treasure of the Kyodo family?

381
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:38,177
-Shut up! -No!

382
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:41,477
I won't let you do that as the 3rd generation successor!

383
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,877
I promised to Grandpa

384
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:46,877
that I would make Kyodo a factory of dreams.

385
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:52,277
Do it if you dare.
