1
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,814
Oh no! I'm late!

2
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:23,014
You're late.

3
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:25,114
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:27,114
Where're Genta and Mitsuhiko?

5
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,814
Oh boy.

6
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:41,414
-What the? That hurts! -I'm sorry!

7
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:42,714
My hand slipped.

8
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,814
It's because you twirl it around exerting too much strength.

9
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,614
I've only got two more days to go,

10
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,814
so that's why I get a bit carried away!

11
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:53,014
The renovation of the flower clock that took quite a while

12
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,714
has finally been completed

13
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:56,614
and an event celebrating the renovated flower clock being displayed

14
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,314
is going to be held.

15
00:00:58,314 --> 00:00:59,314
Ayumi was chosen as

16
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:03,414
one of the grade school baton twirlers to perform there.

17
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,814
That's why she practices like this every morning.

18
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:16,314
It's him.

19
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,214
Like the fog clears.

20
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:25,314
Let's see through love and crime as well.

21
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,114
A mysterious incident that occurs at a park.

22
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:29,014
The flower clock knows the truth.

23
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,614
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,514
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,914
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:22,019
"The Flower Clock Knows"

27
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,219
-So, he's the stalker? -Yep.

28
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,319
He was here yesterday and the day before yesterday, too.

29
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,819
I'm glad we came to serve as your bodyguards!

30
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,119
-Yes. -You can count on us!

31
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,019
Hey, hey. Cut it out, will you?

32
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,119
Ayumi's afraid, can't you see?

33
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,319
Be careful!

34
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,619
You don't know what kind of person he could be.

35
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,619
He stinks of liquor!

36
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,619
What's wrong?

37
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,319
Are you okay?

38
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,819
If he climbs up some place like that drunk...

39
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,519
Is he drunk?

40
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,419
Yeah, he really smelled of liquor.

41
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,219
If he falls from that height,

42
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,019
he's gonna be more than wounded.

43
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,819
I'm sorry, everybody.

44
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,619
For making you get up so early.

45
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:36,919
It's okay

46
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,219
because we all agreed to do so.

47
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:42,519
Besides, we can't let you go to a place

48
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,319
where a man like that appears all by yourself, you know.

49
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,319
Thank you, Ai.

50
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,819
I know I've seen that cap and coat somewhere before.

51
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,319
Do you know him?

52
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,619
I can't really say.

53
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:58,119
I'm sure I could tell if I saw his face, though.

54
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:02,019
Didn't you get to see his face when he exhaled on you?

55
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:05,119
He was wearing his cap deeply over his head, you see.

56
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:07,619
"The next day" -I wonder if he's coming today, too.

57
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,819
If he comes, I'll make sure we disclose his identity today!

58
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,219
Sure thing!

59
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,419
Isn't he the one?

60
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,019
Is he dead?

61
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,519
Yeah.

62
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,719
A scratch wound on his cheek.

63
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,419
Did he get it cut by the tip of the needle?

64
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,219
He sure is skinny, isn't he?

65
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,219
Paint?

66
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,819
So, he was a stalker!

67
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,819
He was after Ayumi who was practicing from early morning!

68
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,719
He came yesterday, too!

69
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,719
He seemed totally wasted!

70
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:01,119
And he climbed this arch.

71
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,719
He climbed this arch drunk?

72
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,319
He almost dangerously fell off.

73
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,819
The dead body was pretty stink with liquor, too.

74
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,219
Inspector!

75
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,119
He's the security guard who made rounds around this park last night.

76
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,619
Thank you for coming.

77
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:21,019
About what time did you make your rounds around this flower clock?

78
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,519
I start my rounds from 3:00 a.m.

79
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,119
I came and checked the area around this flower clock

80
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,419
about 3:50 a.m.

81
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,019
Did you see the dead body then?

82
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,719
No, it wasn't there.

83
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,419
There were no signs of the flowers being messed up either.

84
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,819
This is an accident.

85
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,119
Mr. Mouri.

86
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:42,319
What brings you here?

87
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,019
Ran told me to come get Conan

88
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,519
because he hasn't come home yet, so...

89
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,519
The stone that stands for "6" on the face of the clock

90
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,619
is located right below the arch.

91
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,219
In other words, he climbed the arch drunk, fell

92
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,319
and hit his head on this stone.

93
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,119
I guess that's what roughly happened.

94
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,619
It looks to be so.

95
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,919
And the man died between 03:50 to 04:30.

96
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,219
Since the man had a scratch wound on his cheek

97
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,519
that was made by the long hand of the clock,

98
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,319
I think that after the man fell,

99
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,819
the hand of the clock pointed to 30 minutes.

100
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,119
What time did you all come here?

101
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,919
Let's see...

102
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,919
About 05:20.

103
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,719
In other words, the man got wounded on his cheek at 04:30.

104
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,819
Okay, then Mr. Mouri,

105
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,519
will you take the children home?

106
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,819
Huh? You mean you want me to take them home?

107
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,919
You came to pick them up, didn't you?

108
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,419
This case is an accident,

109
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,519
so all I have left to do is to confirm the man's identity.

110
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,619
I've got a rough idea who is he already anyway.

111
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,519
Huh? What's that?

112
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,019
Isn't he a painter?

113
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,819
He had paint traces on his hand.

114
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,319
He could've got something like that on himself anywhere.

115
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,519
But he had old paint stains

116
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,319
that were deep into the wrinkles of his palm too,

117
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,219
so I'm sure he's somebody that used paint all the time.

118
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,519
It's just as Conan says.

119
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,619
Well, that's the way it is.

120
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,819
So, there's no need for Sleeping Kogoro

121
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,119
to come to the scene this time.

122
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,919
I guess not.

123
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,019
Okay, you guys, let's head home!

124
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,319
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

125
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,419
What is it all of a sudden?

126
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,419
I remember now!

127
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,119
I remember where I met that man.

128
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:31,119
He came over to our store once to buy liquor!

129
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,219
Thanks to Genta's father's testimony,

130
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,019
we found out that the man was a factory worker

131
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:38,219
at a sign factory in the neighborhood.

132
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,519
No doubt about it.

133
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,119
This is Shosaku Yoda, who works for us.

134
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,519
So, he got drunk and died.

135
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,119
Just as would be expected of him.

136
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:49,219
Did he have a bad habit with liquor to begin with?

137
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,219
Yeah.

138
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:53,619
When drunk, he used to feel brave and get violent.

139
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,219
Super awesome!

140
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,919
That's Yoda's last work.

141
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,719
Huh? It's broken.

142
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:04,919
The other day, Yoda tried to put the sign up while drunk

143
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,219
and fell along with the sign.

144
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:10,419
Ever since then, he became afraid of high places,

145
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,019
rested work and soaked himself in liquor.

146
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,719
Afraid of high places?

147
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,219
But he...

148
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,919
Will you please give us the details?

149
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:31,619
The culprit got the better of us.

150
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,519
Just what do you mean, Conan?

151
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,519
Mr. Yoda was afraid of heights.

152
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,419
How could a person like that climb up the arch?

153
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,319
Then, who was it that appeared before us?

154
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,419
Most probably the culprit.

155
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,819
Without knowing that Mr. Yoda had become afraid of heights,

156
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:52,919
he pretended to be Mr. Yoda and repeated weird actions.

157
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,219
By doing so, he wanted to make a homicide look like an accident.

158
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,219
No way.

159
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:01,219
He probably used Ayumi who was practicing

160
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,819
to set her up as an eye-witness.

161
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,019
How ruthless!

162
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,519
How dare he use Ayumi for something like that.

163
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,619
-He can't be forgiven! -Right!

164
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,619
Let's find the culprit for her sake!

165
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:13,619
Yes!

166
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,619
Check the scene of the crime 100 times.

167
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:19,819
That's the basis of an investigation!

168
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,219
Right.

169
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,319
Hide!

170
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,619
"Kyoichiro Kawaguchi (30), PE teacher" -Mr. Kyoichiro Kawaguchi.

171
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:31,019
You're a PE teacher at a high school in Niigata, aren't you?

172
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,019
Yes, that's right.

173
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,119
You know Mr. Shosaku Yoda, don't you?

174
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,419
Of course, I know him well.

175
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,919
He's one person I can't stop hating.

176
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,419
Mr. Yoda who was working as an art teacher

177
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:47,419
at the same high school as you three years ago,

178
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,819
fell in love with your lover who was also

179
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,419
an English teacher at the same high school

180
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,019
and took her away from you.

181
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,619
Mr. Yoda who aggressively made her go driving with him one day,

182
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,319
got into an accident along the way

183
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:01,019
and only she ended up dead.

184
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,319
That was no accident.

185
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,119
Yoda made it look like an accident

186
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,319
and killed my lover!

187
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:09,519
You've been staying over at a business hotel

188
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,519
in front of Haido Station since a week ago, haven't you?

189
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,219
I came to look for Yoda

190
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,419
because I heard rumors that he was in this area.

191
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,119
By the way, where were you

192
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:24,919
between the hours of 03:50 to 04:30 last night?

193
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,619
You want my alibi?

194
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,419
I sure am lucky.

195
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,319
What do you mean?

196
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:33,419
Please contact 119

197
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,919
and ask them when I called the ambulance.

198
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,419
Ambulance?

199
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,519
I'm a scatterbrain, you see.

200
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,419
I mistakenly drank a button type battery

201
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:44,319
along with the medicine tablet I took.

202
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,619
That's why I called an ambulance.

203
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,319
Well, but after I was examined at the hospital,

204
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,419
it turned out that I just drank a plain button so all was well.

205
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,019
Pretty sure it was about 3:30

206
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,919
when they transported me to the hospital.

207
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,019
And it was after 4:30 when they discharged me.

208
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,619
From that hospital to this park,

209
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,419
no matter how I hard I try, it would take 20 minutes.

210
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,519
You can also confirm with the hospital.

211
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,119
By doing so, you'll find that

212
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,119
it was impossible for me to commit the crime.

213
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,619
Please check well.

214
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,419
That man has an alibi

215
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,119
that he was at the hospital from 03:30 to 04:30.

216
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,219
He put the victim to sleep using sleeping pills

217
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:26,419
and wounded the cheek of his victim

218
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,519
with the hand of the clock beforehand.

219
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,919
After leaving the hospital,

220
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,219
he could've hit the head of the victim using the stone

221
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,219
that is used on the face of the clock and killed him.

222
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:36,219
No.

223
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:39,819
His estimated time of death is between 04:00 and 05:00,

224
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,919
so time wise it's possible.

225
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,019
But, as for the wound on his cheek,

226
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,119
it seems there's no doubt that it was put there after he died,

227
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,819
so it would be impossible.

228
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,119
Is that so?

229
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,119
In addition, it seems that

230
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:54,819
small pieces of the stone were found on the wound,

231
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,419
so there's probably no doubt that the crime was committed here.

232
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,319
You sure do know a lot.

233
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:05,719
No. Well, Pops got the information from the police.

234
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,019
So, you used Detective Mouri's voice again

235
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,119
and got information from the police, huh?

236
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,519
The paint that was on the victim's hand,

237
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,819
wasn't there anything characteristic about it?

238
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,419
No, I was told that

239
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,519
it was ordinary paint that you could find anywhere.

240
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,619
Since he was a sign maker,

241
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,119
I guess there's nothing strange about him

242
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,819
having paint on his hands, is there?

243
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,819
It seems that he'd been absent from work recently.

244
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:31,019
Despite that it bothers me

245
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,619
that he had new paint traces on his hands.

246
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:34,319
I see.

247
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,319
What's this door?

248
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:39,619
The device room of the clock, right?

249
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,419
What's the matter, Conan?

250
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,319
The chain sealing the door off has been broken into.

251
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:47,119
What's going on?

252
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,219
Hey, hey!

253
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:50,519
Just what're you doing there?

254
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,519
This chain's been broken.

255
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,919
What?

256
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,019
True. Who'd do something like this?

257
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,419
This is the clock's device room, right?

258
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:04,719
Right. But when they renovated the flower clock,

259
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,919
they started using a thing called "moveless drive"

260
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,419
in which the movable parts are built in,

261
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,319
so it should be empty inside.

262
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,319
It's being used as storage space.

263
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,519
Paint is spilt on the floor.

264
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,419
It's the same color as the one that was on the victim's hands.

265
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,519
It's dried.

266
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,319
So, this isn't where he got the paint on.

267
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,319
Hey, what's going on?

268
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,919
Hey!

269
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,819
This is...

270
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:42,519
Are you all right, all of you?

271
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,819
Conan?

272
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,219
Sonny, let's go.

273
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,364
Did you figure something out?

274
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,464
Yeah.

275
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,964
I'm pretty sure that the guy called Kawaguchi is the culprit.

276
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,764
But he's got an alibi, you know?

277
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:07,464
I hear that the stones on the face of the clock are fixed on tightly,

278
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,664
so I'm sure that the crime was committed near the flower clock.

279
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:13,764
And the only time the culprit could've committed the crime

280
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:16,464
without messing up the flowers on the face of the clock

281
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,364
and wound the victim with the needle of the clock is around "30..."

282
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,464
However...

283
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:21,664
The only time he could've committed the crime would've been 04:30,

284
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:25,164
but he had just left the hospital around that time.

285
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:27,264
Let's play see-saw next!

286
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,564
Genta!

287
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:32,164
Are you all right?

288
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,764
Ouch, ouch...

289
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,264
I hit my head.

290
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:38,264
You scraped your cheek.

291
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:39,764
I get it!

292
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,664
That's how he did it!

293
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,164
Conan!

294
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,164
Let's go after him!

295
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:01,064
It's just as I thought.

296
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,764
Conan, what's wrong?

297
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,864
Did you figure something out?

298
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,564
-Yeah. -Hey, you guys!

299
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,564
What're you doing there?

300
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,464
Just the right timing to get here, Pops.

301
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:16,564
Hurry on home and do your homework!

302
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,464
And, Mr. Mouri,

303
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:21,464
what is it you wanted to talk to us about?

304
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:25,164
A drinking friend of mine knows Mr. Yoda

305
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:28,364
and told me something unexpected about him.

306
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:30,364
Something unexpected?

307
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:35,264
The fact is, last month while putting up a sign, Mr. Yoda fell down

308
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:38,864
and since then have had a fear of heights!

309
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,464
I've heard about that already.

310
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:45,464
Huh? Then, what about the traffic accident

311
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,864
when he ended up killing a woman?

312
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:49,964
I've got a report on that, too.

313
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:53,964
That woman was my lover.

314
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,864
Who could you be?

315
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,464
My name's Kawaguchi.

316
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:01,564
I'm a prime suspect for now.

317
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:03,664
Is that correct?

318
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,764
Now all the performers have gathered.

319
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:09,064
Mr. Kawaguchi, what brings you here?

320
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,864
I figured that I'd come to see

321
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,764
the place where Yoda died before leaving for Niigata.

322
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:17,664
No, I can't let you leave yet.

323
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:20,864
But you did confirm with the hospital, didn't you?

324
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:24,664
If so, you must've found out that I'm not the culprit, correct?

325
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,564
So, if you will excuse me.

326
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:29,964
Hold it!

327
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,464
No, I said nothing.

328
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:36,864
I'm spinning, spinning.

329
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,664
Round and round...

330
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:43,164
I'm not finished with my story yet, Mr. Kawaguchi.

331
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,464
So, you're the famous Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

332
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,964
What more do you have to say?

333
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,164
Inspector.

334
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:55,364
Would you please let me hear Mr. Kawaguchi's alibi?

335
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:58,064
Okay. He was at the hospital

336
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:00,564
between the hours of 03:30 to 04:30 last night.

337
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:03,964
From that hospital to here it takes 20 minutes.

338
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:06,364
In other words, I couldn't have committed the crime.

339
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:09,664
Which means, you could've come here by 05:00.

340
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:12,264
Even if I came here at 05:00, I couldn't have done anything.

341
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:13,764
No.

342
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:17,864
You locked Mr. Yoda up in the device room of the flower clock

343
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,864
and came back at 05:00 to kill him!

344
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,264
What?

345
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,864
Don't be ridiculous.

346
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:28,364
Otherwise, there would be no wound on the cheek of the victim.

347
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:30,664
It's 5:00 sharp right now.

348
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:35,464
Just 12 hours ago, Mr. Kawaguchi hit Mr. Yoda's head against the stone

349
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,964
by the "6" of the flower clock and killed him.

350
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,764
Then, with the long hand that indicated "12",

351
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:43,464
he wounded the cheek of the victim

352
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:46,564
and lay the dead body near the "6".

353
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:50,964
How can I go to "12" without messing up the flowers?

354
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,064
If to the "5" on the face of the clock,

355
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:57,164
you could step over it without messing up the flowers.

356
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:00,064
You carried Mr. Yoda's dead body

357
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:02,464
and walked on the needle of the flower clock,

358
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:06,164
went over to the long hand that was on the "12"

359
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:09,264
and made the wound on Mr. Yoda's cheek.

360
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,764
Then, you walked back on the needle and returned.

361
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,364
Do you have proof?

362
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:15,564
You know, evidence!

363
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:17,864
No use bluffing courage

364
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:21,864
because the flower clock saw all that you did,

365
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,364
and told me about it.

366
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,864
What?

367
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,964
There is a slight blood stain on the place "12".

368
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:31,564
What?

369
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:36,264
Actually, the stone and the needle do not touch each other,

370
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:37,364
but since you walked on the needle

371
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:39,164
in addition to carrying Mr. Yoda while you did so,

372
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:42,464
the needle bent and now touches the stone.

373
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:45,364
And the blood of Mr. Yoda's cheek that you wounded

374
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,164
flowed through the needle

375
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:49,664
and stained the stone.

376
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:53,864
If we inspect it, I'm sure it'll match Mr. Yoda's blood.

377
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:57,464
But that doesn't prove that I did it, does it?

378
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,164
If we check the shoe prints on the needle,

379
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,564
your shoe prints are sure to be detected.

380
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,164
Not talking of the short hand,

381
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:06,364
as far as the long hand is concerned,

382
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,964
the amount of time the stone can support a person's weight

383
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,864
without squashing the flowers is but a minute.

384
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,664
It would've been impossible for you

385
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:15,164
to make a round trip to wound Mr. Yoda's cheek

386
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:18,764
and more so to erase your shoe prints.

387
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,864
Well...

388
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:22,164
Mr. Kawaguchi.

389
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:24,464
Although you're not aware of it,

390
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:28,964
Mr. Yoda left a message saying that you killed him.

391
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,264
That's ridiculous.

392
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,764
Conan! Show the Inspector the way!

393
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:35,364
Yes, sir!

394
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,264
Follow me!

395
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:40,764
You too, Mr. Kawaguchi!

396
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:48,964
Is Mr. Yoda's message left behind here?

397
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,764
I don't see anything like that around.

398
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:53,164
He's right!

399
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:57,364
What...

400
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:01,764
This is...

401
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:05,464
Florescent paint was spilt on the floor.

402
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,564
It started to shine after it got pitch dark.

403
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,164
What did you say?

404
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,364
Pops told me that

405
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:15,264
florescent paint doesn't shine in the dark

406
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:17,364
unless you first shine light on it.

407
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:19,364
He went on to say that since this place was dark all the while,

408
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:22,164
during the time that Mr. Yoda was being confined by Mr. Kawaguchi,

409
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,964
it didn't shine.

410
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:25,264
I see.

411
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,564
Since he went in and out only at night,

412
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:28,564
so no one would see him,

413
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:31,664
no light came in even if he opened the door!

414
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:35,164
But, where is the message?

415
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:36,964
Over there!

416
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,964
This is...

417
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,264
The culprit is...

418
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,964
Kawaguchi!

419
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:46,564
Mr. Yoda, who was confined here,

420
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,964
noticed that paint was spilt,

421
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:51,264
and left behind his final message.

422
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:53,864
However, it was coincidentally the same color paint

423
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:57,164
as the florescent paint that was spilt on the floor.

424
00:21:57,164 --> 00:22:03,164
Therefore, Mr. Yoda's message became invisible in bright light.

425
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:06,064
We will investigate this room thoroughly.

426
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:08,364
We'll look for evidence of Mr. Yoda's confinement

427
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:11,764
as well as the traces of you having gone in and out of this room too.

428
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,064
Darn it!

429
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:16,864
I thought that this was a perfect plan, and yet!

430
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:19,264
This can't be! It just can't be!

431
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:50,664
The display ceremony of the flower clock

432
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:54,064
was held a week later than scheduled.
