1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,340
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,440
Codes and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,040
The seven steps of decorative Hina dolls.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,640
The mystery of the burglar that is hidden in the red steps.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,760
Look, look at that Hina doll!

9
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,460
How beautiful!

10
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,960
Yes.

11
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,660
Oh, so Girls' Day Festival is right around the corner.

12
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,960
I really like that Hina doll.

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,560
But, you've already got a nice one at home, Ayumi.

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,460
Hey, did you forget?

15
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,760
Last year you dropped the girl Hina doll

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,360
and its hands and neck broke off, right?

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
Oh, that's right!

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

19
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,560
But, I guess you can have it repaired.

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,760
Of course she did.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,660
But while the craftsman was repairing the doll,

22
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,260
he got hurt and blood splattered on the face of the doll.

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,560
When the doll was finally repaired,

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,960
Peach the dog next door

25
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,260
came up to Ayumi holding the doll's neck in its jaw.

26
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,260
The paint that was used to cover the blood on the face

27
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,560
was peeled off,

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
its hair was disheveled

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,160
and it was wearing a dreadful facial expression.

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,860
Hey.

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,260
Seriously, that doll is cursed!

32
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,960
Yes. Ever since then, the doll set

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,460
was securely packed away in a box by Ayumi's father

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,760
who was worried that the dolls may bring upon misfortune.

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,860
Hey!

36
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,960
I hear that it is still way deep inside the closet...

37
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,560
It's not cursed.

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,760
Peach brought the doll to me wanting to show it to me as soon as possible.

39
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,460
And, the neck of the doll just happened to fall off then.

40
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,660
-Hey. -Hey, Ayumi.

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,760
Don't cry.

42
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,660
Just playing.

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,560
Peach's owner asked an acquaintance of his for me,

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,460
so that person is going to give me a set of Girls' Festival dolls

45
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,360
that she isn't using anymore!

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,260
It has seven rows of dolls and is larger than the one I had!

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,760
She says I could have the doll set if I can line them up correctly

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,960
without looking at anything for reference!

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,460
But you'd have to line up quite a number of dolls

50
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,760
if the set has seven rows to it.

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,560
Can you handle it alone?

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
I'll be just fine,

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,860
because I memorized how the dolls are line up over and over!

54
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,060
And besides, I'm not going to do it alone.

55
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,260
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 1)"

56
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,960
Hi, Ayumi!

57
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,660
So, did you memorize how the dolls are to be lined up?

58
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,460
You didn't look too confident when you came last time so...

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,660
Yep, no problem!

60
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,660
Okay, then I guess I'll have you line them up right now.

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,560
Are these all boxes with dolls in them?

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Why do you have to memorize how the dolls

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
are supposed to be lined up, though?

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,260
Because she thinks that Ayumi's going to make a mistake.

65
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,760
The fact is, she doesn't want to give it away.

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,660
That's not exactly it.

67
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,460
We're just checking to see

68
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,360
if she's a girl that will take good care of the dolls.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,460
Learning to line the dolls up correctly

70
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,260
will give rise to more affection towards the dolls, no?

71
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,360
After all, they are very precious dolls

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,660
that were bought for me.

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,260
I wish you luck then, little lady!

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Thank you!

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,260
There.

76
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Oh, Genta, that's not right.

77
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,260
The man with the bow and arrow belongs more to the top!

78
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,960
Yeah, but the more the merrier!

79
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
No! You've got to line them up correctly.

80
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,860
And, while you're at it, that old man is the minister of the left

81
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,260
and belongs on the fourth step to the very right.

82
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,760
The young one that looks a lot like him is the minister of the right

83
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,160
and belongs on the same step to the very left,

84
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,660
so don't get them wrong!

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,860
The left belongs to the right and the right belongs to the left...

86
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,460
You know so much despite being a boy.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,860
I helped Ran a lot when I was a kid.

88
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,460
You used to line them up when you were a kid too, didn't you?

89
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,060
Oh, didn't I tell you?

90
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,960
I was sent off to the States to study as early as I can remember

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,060
so this is the first time I'm even touching these dolls.

92
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,260
It seems my parents got my older sister Girls' Festival dolls

93
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,260
but my parents died soon after I was born too, so...

94
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,760
Besides, my sister never took the dolls out

95
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,360
because they brought back sad memories.

96
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,960
How did your parents die?

97
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,060
Well, it seems that my sister was told that

98
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,760
they died of an accident during some research they were doing.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,460
Come to think of it, I remember that

100
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,160
Pisco once mentioned that your parents were scientists.

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,960
Yes, although my mother was not all that well known.

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
My father, Atsushi Miyano

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,760
seems to have been pretty well-known in the field

104
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,760
as a mad scientist who was ousted from academic circles.

105
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,760
As a mad scientist?

106
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,460
Hey, what the heck are you talking about?

107
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,360
You developed that drug because you took over

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
what your parents were doing, didn't you?

109
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,060
Just what kind of drug was it?

110
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,660
A secret drug...

111
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,660
A secret drug that's used to revive the dead.

112
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,160
Will this answer satisfy you?

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,560
Then, don't tell me

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,060
the stuff that was written in the diary was...

115
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,460
Just as I thought.

116
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,160
The thing you were looking at on the computer the other day

117
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,760
was a clue to those people, wasn't it?

118
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,460
And after you traced the clue,

119
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,360
you found out where they stopped by

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,260
but aside from what you expected, while you were waiting for them,

121
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,060
you overslept.

122
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,360
I guess the story went something like this.

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,760
Yeah, well, sort of.

124
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,260
Well, you don't have to worry.

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,860
The goal of my research

126
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,560
has nothing to do with making a dream-like drug like that.

127
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,060
Most of the people here on earth

128
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,060
would find no value in the stuff I'm involved in now.

129
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,260
That's right.

130
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,360
It's like the Girl's Festival dolls that are important

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,060
only for the girls of this small country.

132
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,760
Let's go from the top. The Emperor, the Empress.

133
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,160
Three Court Ladies, the Five Musicians,

134
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,460
the two "guardians", the Minister of the Left and Minister of the Right.

135
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,060
And on the fifth step are the Three Pages,

136
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,960
expressing the human emotions of laughter, worry and anger!

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,560
You've passed with flying colors!

138
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,460
Then, are you going to give me this doll set?

139
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,860
Yes! I'll have it delivered to you by courier right away!

140
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,960
-All right! -Make sure you thank grandma later, okay?

141
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,160
Okay!

142
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Shall we start cleaning up, then?

143
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
We went out of our way to line them up,

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
and we're going to put them away already?

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,760
It can't be helped, because it has to be packed to send out.

146
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,860
Oh, wait! Let's all take a picture in front of it first!

147
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,060
I brought daddy's digital camera with me!

148
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Okay, here goes.

149
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,660
Say cheese!

150
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,360
My, I wonder who it is.

151
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,060
Oh, Mr. Tsumagari of Room 503.

152
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,160
Hello.

153
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,260
If it's about that thing, I'm sure my husband already refused.

154
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,860
Yes, but I just can't give it up.

155
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,260
I brought an appraiser with me today,

156
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,960
and I thought I'd ask him one more time.

157
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,460
How do you do?

158
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
This way, please.

159
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,660
This is really something.

160
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,360
This is a fine Hina doll set.

161
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,160
A famous doll craftsman in Kyoto seems to have made it.

162
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,960
And? How much will you sell it to me for?

163
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,060
Are you buying these dolls?

164
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,860
Too late, mister!

165
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,360
They were already given to Ayumi!

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,460
No, I don't have a daughter so I'm not interested in dolls!

167
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,960
What I want her to sell me

168
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,360
is the hanging scroll behind all of you.

169
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,660
That's the Thunder God that was drawn

170
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,460
by an artist of the Edo era named Tetsuyama.

171
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,560
I have the Wind God which is the other half of this hanging scroll,

172
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,060
and I really want to make it a complete set.

173
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,060
But, my husband says he has no intention of selling it,

174
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,760
and besides, it doesn't look to be something so valuable.

175
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,660
Huh? Don't you know?

176
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,860
How valuable that hanging scroll is!

177
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,360
Do you have any idea how much insurance

178
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,360
your husband's late father placed on it?

179
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,260
Well, no.

180
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,360
20,000,000 yen! It's 20,000,000 yen!

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,160
That much?

182
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,460
I told your husband that I would pay him double that.

183
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Besides, I feel sorry for this hanging scroll.

184
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,960
If kept in this manner, the value of this scroll will go down.

185
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,260
I think it'd be wiser to sell it

186
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,260
to a professional collector like Mr. Tsumagari.

187
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,260
But my husband...

188
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,060
We will not sell it.

189
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,760
No matter how much money you dish out for it.

190
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Mother...

191
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Okay, I'll be back again tonight

192
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,960
just about the time your husband comes home.

193
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm sure he'll agree to sell it.

194
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,960
If I mention the story about him making a great loss in stocks...

195
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,160
Let's put away the dolls and hurry on home too, then.

196
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,960
How nostalgic.

197
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,660
It's already been 10 years since we last decorated them.

198
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,960
The dolls look happy that they were taken out of the box

199
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,160
after such a long time too.

200
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,860
Mother.

201
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,260
Ayumi, would it be okay to decorate these dolls here

202
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,660
until Girls' Day Festival this year?

203
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,960
I guess mother wants to say goodbye to them.

204
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Sure!

205
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,860
But, can I stay here a while longer then?

206
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Because I have one more picture I want to take.

207
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,660
Why don't you have mother serve you some sweet sake then?

208
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,960
I thought we were out of the ingredients to make it from scratch.

209
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh, no.

210
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
I have to go out soon too.

211
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,960
I'll go buy it then! The supermarket is right there!

212
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,660
Thank you very much!

213
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,760
Ayumi, isn't it about time you tell us?

214
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,460
Just what do you want to take a picture of?

215
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,060
A picture of all of us having a good time!

216
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,860
We just took one like that a while ago!

217
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,960
Something even better.

218
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,860
Which way was it?

219
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,160
This way.

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,060
Okay, just a little while more to go!

221
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,460
Come on, let's go.

222
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,560
Oh, okay!

223
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,060
I think it was just around this corner.

224
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,460
Isn't that the appraiser?

225
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
I thought you went home.

226
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,860
Well, I forgot my cell phone.

227
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,860
I called my cell phone, then the lady answered

228
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,660
and told me that it's in the living room.

229
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,560
She told me I could get it when I go over tonight,

230
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,060
but I may get important phone calls so...

231
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,860
I decided to pick it up now.

232
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,560
But, it seems that no one's home.

233
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,260
You mean grandma isn't home?

234
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh, he's right. Nobody's home.

235
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,060
No one is here...

236
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,260
Hey, the door's not locked!

237
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Grandma, are you sleeping?

238
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,160
What is this sound?

239
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,460
I think it's the sound of the fax machine.

240
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,260
It's coming from this room.

241
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,560
What the heck is going on?

242
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
The room is super messed up!

243
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,460
The fax seems to be from her husband.

244
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,760
Hey.

245
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
That doesn't seem to be the only place.

246
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,960
Burglary. A burglar broke in after we left.

247
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,260
By the looks of it, maybe the other rooms are messed up too.

248
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,460
Ayumi!

249
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,560
I'm glad. The dolls seem okay.

250
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,460
This room looks untouched.

251
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,860
I wonder where grandma is, though.

252
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,860
It seems that grandma's not the only one who disappeared!

253
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,360
Look!

254
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,760
The hanging scroll of the Thunder God is gone too.

255
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,640
Let's call the police! Please call the police!

256
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,940
Okay!

257
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,040
Grandma?

258
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,640
Oh, so I did miss you, after all.

259
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,040
Where were you, grandma?

260
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Well, when I looked, I found out that I had also run out of sugar,

261
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,740
so I went to buy some.

262
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,140
By the way, why are you all looking pale-faced about?

263
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,840
Well, the thing is...

264
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Setsuko, I thought you went out.

265
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,140
I forgot my wallet so I came back to get it.

266
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,340
The bedroom's...

267
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,540
Oh, my.

268
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,640
Oh, so we were just about to call the police...

269
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,840
Mr. Tsumagari!

270
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,040
What's up? I heard somebody scream.

271
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,140
Oh, well, the thing is...

272
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,140
A burglar, a burglar broke in!

273
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,740
Let's talk after the police get here.

274
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,840
I see, so from what I've gathered here...

275
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,940
Those children came here to decorate the Hina dolls,

276
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,340
and after that Mr. Tsumagari who extremely

277
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,940
wanted the hanging scroll that was stolen,

278
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,540
brought appraiser, Mr. Mie with him.

279
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,640
Officer, I don't really go for that remark.

280
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,240
And after the two men left, you five went out shopping.

281
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,540
Yeah, to buy the ingredients for making sweet sake!

282
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,040
Ingredients for sweet sake?

283
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,940
Mother was going to make sweet sake for everyone,

284
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
but we were out of the necessary ingredients.

285
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,140
Since I had to go out, I asked the children to go get it.

286
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,640
After that you were here alone, Grandma Yayoi?

287
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Yes, exactly.

288
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Did you notice anything then?

289
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,140
Like strange noises.

290
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,140
It was quiet,

291
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,640
until the cell phone that he forgot in the living room rang.

292
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,940
Yeah.

293
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,540
Oh, you forgot your cell phone in the living room?

294
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,940
We were shown into the living room first,

295
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,340
because the children were in the Japanese room.

296
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,240
But, we wanted to see the hanging scroll as soon as possible,

297
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,440
so forced our way immediately into the Japanese room.

298
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,840
And, after the phone call,

299
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,340
you seem to have gone out shopping too, but for what?

300
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,440
I went out to buy sugar.

301
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,540
I realized that we were out of sugar, so I rushed out to get some.

302
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,540
Do you know about what time it was?

303
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,640
Well, it was right after I hung up so...

304
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,940
Then, I can tell what time it was!

305
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,640
Just before I hung up, I heard the sound

306
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,040
of the fax machine on the other side of the line,

307
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,840
so if we look at the time the fax was sent,

308
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,940
we can find out what time it was!

309
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,840
Who was the fax from?

310
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I think it was from my husband.

311
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,740
Then where is that original fax?

312
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,240
In the living room.

313
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,540
My God, they really went all out messing up the room.

314
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,640
So this is the fax you received from your husband.

315
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,940
Yes.

316
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,340
15:28.

317
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,740
What else was stolen besides the hanging scroll?

318
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Nothing. Only here and the bedroom were ransacked.

319
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,240
Even the wallet that was on the shelf above the TV

320
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,540
was left untouched.

321
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,440
May I have a minute with you, Officer Momose?

322
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,240
It seems that the burglar

323
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,040
broke in from the veranda facing this window.

324
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Just as I thought.

325
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,440
Why do you think that this is the way the burglar broke in?

326
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,240
We're on the 6th floor.

327
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,940
It's a common target

328
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,040
for burglars who use a rope to get down from the roof.

329
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,040
They seem to think that people living on the top floor of condos are rich,

330
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,040
and most times the windows aren't locked anyway.

331
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,540
You sure know a lot, don't you, Haibara?

332
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,640
Yes, because I live with an old man who likes to watch wide-shows on TV.

333
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,040
If I'm not mistaken, you're the first ones

334
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,640
who realized that the room was ransacked?

335
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,940
Yeah, when we got back from shopping, the front door was unlocked.

336
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,340
And when we heard the sound of the fax machine

337
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,540
and came into the living room, it was all messed up!

338
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,640
At that time, the clock on the fax was 15:40!

339
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,940
Which means that the burglary took place

340
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,040
between 15:30 and 15:40, a period of 10 minutes.

341
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,340
I wonder.

342
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,440
The burglar went down on the veranda

343
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,640
and came in through that window, right?

344
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,540
If it were me, I'd be too scared to come in.

345
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,940
See, if you close the window,

346
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,540
nothing is in view from the veranda because of the curtain.

347
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,240
If the burglar opens the window wanting to look inside,

348
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
the curtain would flutter in the wind,

349
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,740
and the lady on the phone would notice.

350
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,740
And, besides the time the fax was sent out all show 15:28!

351
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,940
Which means that the fax kept coming in

352
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,640
all the while we were out shopping until we came back, right?

353
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,340
Do you think a burglar would break into a room

354
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
where noise is constantly coming from?

355
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,340
But, it's just the sound of the fax.

356
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,940
The more so frightening because it's the fax!

357
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,140
Because if the fax completes coming in and the buzzer sounds,

358
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,740
somebody in the house may come to take a look at it!

359
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,340
I see.

360
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,740
Beside, it's strange that the burglar didn't notice her wallet

361
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,940
and if the burglar couldn't find what he was after,

362
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,640
wouldn't all the other rooms be ransacked too?

363
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,440
True...

364
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,040
The strangest thing is,

365
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,040
why only the hanging scroll was stolen.

366
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,140
But, that hanging scroll is worth 20,000,000 yen.

367
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,040
You idiot, only a professional would know

368
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,940
if that scroll is really worth that price.

369
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,440
Which means that the burglar knew that the scroll was here to begin with.

370
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,940
Yeah.

371
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,540
But if the burglar was after the scroll,

372
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,140
the other room wouldn't have been ransacked.

373
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,740
Maybe the burglar messed up the other room

374
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,640
just to throw people off, so that he's not suspected.

375
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,340
Which means that the culprit has no definite alibi

376
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,640
and on top of that had to face the police reluctantly after the incident.

377
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,840
Furthermore, that person knows the value of that hanging scroll!

378
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,840
Come to think of it, you were loitering around

379
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,340
in front of this house, weren't you?

380
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,340
I just told you, didn't I?

381
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,740
That I came to get my cell phone, but nobody was home.

382
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,040
But, the door wasn't locked!

383
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,440
Well...

384
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,040
Did you lock the door when you left the house?

385
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,540
Well, I think I did, but I was in a rush so...

386
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,340
By the way, why were you at the front door a while ago, mister?

387
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I came to check things out

388
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,940
because Mr. Mie didn't come back for some time.

389
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,340
-Were you all here? -Yes.

390
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,940
Then, you also knew that he forgot his cell phone, right?

391
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Yes, since he was by me until I started talking to grandma.

392
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,840
You mean you left while he was on the phone?

393
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,940
I just went to buy some cigarettes!

394
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,340
In other words, just as this child just said,

395
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,640
you two do not have an alibi yet.

396
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,940
Hey, will you cut out just suspecting us?

397
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,840
Those two are going to get 20,000,000 yen too

398
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,940
if insurance money comes in!

399
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,340
I'm just saying even you two can carry out something like this!

400
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,640
-What a thing to say? -Stop it.

401
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,140
We sure are in a fix.

402
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,840
All four of you have motives, no alibi and on top of that,

403
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,540
all of you are capable of carrying out the crime.

404
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,440
The key to nailing down the culprit is...

405
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,940
in the Japanese room!

406
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,000
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,880
"Steps"

408
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,060
-Today is March 3rd. -Festival for little birds.

409
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,460
-No, it's Girls' Festival. -Piyopiyo. (Mimicking bird sounds)
