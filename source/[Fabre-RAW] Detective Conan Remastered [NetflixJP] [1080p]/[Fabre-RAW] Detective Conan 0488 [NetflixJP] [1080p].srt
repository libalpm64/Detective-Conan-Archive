1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,780
What? Cancel our last live show?

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,980
Yeah.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,980
I don't think any of you

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,680
have the thing it takes to fill the hall up anymore.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,990
I think it's better for you this way too.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,890
Boss! Please wait, Boss!

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,390
Our last live is something

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,090
that I went out of my way to get to.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,790
Well, you see this is all business.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,800
I can't go through with something that I know

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,900
is going to put us in the red.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,200
Then, just how do you propose we say goodbye to our fans?

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
Why don't you write about it on your website or something?

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,110
I can write it for you again like last time. Would you like me to?

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,680
But you'll still have to work another six months for me.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,680
As for variety shows and talk shows,

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,980
you're still worth some value.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,680
You've gotta be kidding.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,490
If you're not going to let us do our last live show,

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,590
I'll quit right this.

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,090
Just fine with me!

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,490
But if you quit while the contract is still valid,

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,000
you're paying me for damages incurred.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Okay. Bye.

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,380
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,480
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,090
The stage today is at a TV station.

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,490
In a glamorous world of masks,

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,390
there is danger of real faces being exposed.

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,890
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,090
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,290
"Devil at the TV Station".

34
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,200
-What? -What?

35
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
You mean the location that the TV station

36
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,510
was going on was cancelled?

37
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,610
No joke?

38
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,080
I was really looking forward to it.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Yes. We thought we would be seeing...

41
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,590
-I'm so sorry. -a new Jocker monster.

42
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,890
I was looking forward to eating box lunch on location.

43
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,390
The staff member was an acquaintance of mine,

44
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,190
so I got to invite you over,

45
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,990
but they don't seem to be able to cope with spectators now.

46
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,800
So, I'm really so sorry!

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
No, it's okay.

48
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,310
Well, all's well

50
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,810
because we did get to specially come into the TV studio after all.

51
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,180
So, why don't we go look around here?

52
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,180
Right!

53
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,680
That's right!

54
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
I'll bet there're many famous people here!

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,190
I'd like to see the weather lady!

56
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,890
I'd like to see Toraya!

57
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,990
I want to see Yak!

58
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,600
Hey, a popular idol, Ms. Yoko Okino,

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,300
is right before your eyes.

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
Good morning, Yoko!

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,500
Good morning.

62
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,110
It's Ms. Kazuka Inoue! See.

63
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,210
Really!

64
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,310
The gourmet lady.

65
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,510
"Kazuka Inoue" -Yoko.

66
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,980
Take it easy on me today, okay?

67
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,580
Same to you!

68
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,080
Her parents run a noodle shop, right?

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,690
I wonder if they serve eels over rice.

70
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,090
Oh, come on, Genta.

71
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,090
Kazuka Inoue, birthday May 13th.

72
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,790
166 centimeters tall.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Good morning.

74
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,900
-Good morning! -Good morning.

75
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,800
"Azusa Yamamoto" -Good morning.

76
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,180
It's Ms. Azusa Yamamoto, Genta!

77
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,180
Famous people here there and everywhere.

78
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,980
Yoko Okino, Kazuka Inoue, Azusa Yamamoto.

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,690
Hey, you guys...

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
But how lucky to see so many idols so soon!

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,210
-Yep! -Right!

82
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,980
You all look familiar.

83
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,080
I think I've seen you somewhere before too.

84
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,490
You probably saw us in the papers or something!

85
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,290
Because we are...

86
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,490
-the Youth Detective Squad! -The Youth Detective Squad!

87
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,690
-Youth Detective Squad? -Youth Detective Squad?

88
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,100
Right, we're the Youth Detective Squad!

89
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,900
We've arrested a lot of bad guys!

90
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,700
Yes!

91
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,900
Really?

92
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,010
Wow!

93
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,610
Well, it's really no big deal...

94
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,880
Conan here in particular is special.

95
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,980
He's a famous detective trained by Mr. Mouri.

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,890
You mean that famous Mr. Mouri?

97
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,090
Yes! Kogoro Mouri!

98
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,990
He's a great fan of mine!

99
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,490
Come to think of it,

100
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,200
he's well known for being a fan of yours.

101
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,900
I guess questions involving cases and deductions

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,000
are all yours, Yoko.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Not really!

104
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,000
What questions?

105
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,010
We're shooting a quiz program today.

106
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,110
All three of us

107
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,180
are challenging each other answering the questions.

108
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,680
I see. That's why you said to take it easy on you.

109
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,090
Yoko, forget that we're friends today.

110
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,390
I'm going to be a devil today

111
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,990
and I'm going to win no matter what!

112
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,290
What? Oh, no. A devil?

113
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,690
A devil.

114
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,300
A devil, she says.

115
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
What's the matter, Ayumi?

116
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,300
-It appeared! -It appeared!

117
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,880
So I'll bet you're the new monster

118
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
that's appearing in Kamen Yaiba?

119
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,480
I'd say he's more like

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,990
the new executive of the evil organization rather than a monster.

121
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,190
He's the new boss! I'm sure he's the boss!

122
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,900
What's with you, Brats?

123
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,000
You mean you guys really don't know who I am?

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
-No. -No.

125
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Nope.

126
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,810
I've really fallen to the pit.

127
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,680
Well, I guess you're not all that wrong in saying

128
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,480
that I'm a monster that appears in Kamen Yaiba.

129
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,390
Good morning!

130
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,690
I wonder who he is?

131
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,590
I've never seen him before.

132
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,700
Neither have I.

133
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,700
He's the vocal for a rock group called Styx III.

134
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Mr. Satan Onizuka!

135
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,210
"Satan Onizuka (32), vocalist for Styx III"

136
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,210
I heard that he's going to be appearing on a variety show today.

137
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,380
A rock singer appearing on a variety show.

138
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,080
I guess the world of devils is going through tough times too.

139
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,390
Onizuka? Satan.

140
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,190
Satan? Onizuka Satan?

141
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,790
Satan Onizuka?

142
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,190
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

143
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,700
It's nothing.

144
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,800
Satan Onizuka...

145
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I've heard this name somewhere before, I think.

146
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,610
I remember!

147
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,180
My older sister is Satan Onizuka's fan,

148
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,780
and she asked me to do her a favor!

149
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,880
She asked me to get his autograph for her

150
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,180
if I get to see him at the TV station!

151
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,890
I've got to go after him right away and get his autograph!

152
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,490
But he seems to have gone some place already.

153
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,790
Talk about exaggerating.

154
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,300
Now, now.

155
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,600
If we ask Yoko where his dressing room is,

156
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,300
I'm sure we can.

157
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
Right, Yoko?

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,010
Huh? Where's Yoko?

159
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,180
Yoko was here just a second ago...

160
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,480
Oh, the AD came to get her just a while ago

161
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,090
saying that it was time for her to go on air.

162
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,490
He took the two challengers along too.

163
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,290
Well, I guess we'll just have to find her on our own.

164
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,990
True!

165
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,500
I mean we know that he's here in the TV station after all.

166
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,600
Yes!

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,300
Let's go look for him together!

168
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,210
"Satan Onizuka"

169
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,080
Huh?

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,580
Mr. Satan.

171
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,080
You're already here.

172
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,190
I thought you were supposed to come in after noon?

173
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,190
Yeah, I came early because I had nothing to do.

174
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,600
So, won't you order me a take out meal, manager?

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
I didn't have lunch yet.

176
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,200
Okay, no problem.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
So, what would you like?

178
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,310
Tenpuku-tei's ramen and...

179
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,110
Tenpuku-tei's ramen.

180
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,480
Fried rice from Janjanken.

181
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Janjanken's fried rice and...

182
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,890
That's right, I want to eat Eirinan's dumplings.

183
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,090
Erinan's dumplings.

184
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,590
Ramen, fried rice, dumplings...

185
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,790
You mean you want all three dishes from a different shop?

186
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,700
Since they are all Chinese dishes, why not order them from the same shop?

187
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,400
Who cares!

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,900
I want that certain dish from that certain shop!

189
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,300
Besides, I go to all three shops often to eat,

190
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,010
so I'm sure they'll bring my order even it's only one dish each.

191
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,680
By the way,

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
did you find that mirror?

193
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Yes!

194
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,580
An acquaintance of mine seems to have found something similar,

195
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,190
so I was thinking of going to that shop now.

196
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,790
Is that right?

197
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,490
Thanks.

198
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,990
It just has to be that mirror,

199
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,690
or I just can't seem to get myself into make-up mode.

200
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,300
Okay, I'll be on my way then, to go get it.

201
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
And...

202
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,400
after I eat lunch, I'll catch some sleep,

203
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
so, don't wake me up, okay?

204
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,810
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,910
I had it out with boss last night,

206
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,880
and couldn't sleep because I was bothered about it.

207
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,780
Boss is here too, isn't he?

208
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
Yes.

209
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,090
I'm sure he's in the reception room on the second floor.

210
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,990
I'll be on my way then.

211
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,790
After I finish shooting, I want to go apologize.

212
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,190
Good idea.

213
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,600
TV stations are so complicated

214
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,310
that it's hard to tell what's where.

215
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,710
I'll bet it's even hard to find the restroom.

216
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,380
It's like a labyrinth.

217
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
I think it's better to ask someone, after all.

218
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,780
I guess so.

219
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,700
Yes!

220
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,310
"Meeting Room"

221
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,810
You're early!

222
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,780
I thought the meeting was scheduled to start from 2:00?

223
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,680
Oh, it's you.

224
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm sorry about last night.

225
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,390
Are you going to have a meeting at the TV station, Boss?

226
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,090
I want to have them use one of the actors of my company

227
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,800
as a regular on the new program, so I'm putting in a request.

228
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,700
Don't you have to take a program from 2:00 yourself too?

229
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,610
-Are you ready for it? -Yes.

230
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,010
All I need is 30 minutes. That'll be more than enough.

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,880
Right, about that matter...

232
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,180
I already refused.

233
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,890
I know you're not feeling good about it,

234
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,590
but I did so for your sake too.

235
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,290
Forget it, let's not talk about that.

236
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,290
By the way, what do you think of this raincoat?

237
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200
It's light and water-proof.

238
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
And above all, it's cheap!

239
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,600
I guess it's good.

240
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,210
And, what I like most of all about it

241
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,910
is when you pull the hood over your head like this...

242
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,590
It's a superb item that keeps blood

243
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,990
from splattering on your body.

244
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,590
"Satan Onizuka"

245
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,890
There it is!

246
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,790
Satan Onizuka.

247
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,690
I'm sure it's here.

248
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,390
Lucky you, Mitsuhiko!

249
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,490
Yes!

250
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,500
But I wonder if it'll be okay?

251
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,700
To just go in like that without an appointment.

252
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
Maybe he's going to scold us with that frightening face.

253
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
We'll be fine!

254
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,270
There are many people walking the corridor,

255
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,180
so if things start looking bad, we can call for help.

256
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,080
What? Why call for help?

257
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,980
Okay, I'm going to knock on the door then!

258
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,590
Hey!

259
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,990
No!

260
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,190
Satan is sleeping now.

261
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,790
He's sleeping?

262
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,200
Yes.

263
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm going to sleep.

264
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,400
If I don't sleep, I can't build up my evil powers.

265
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,470
I... I'm sorry,

266
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,980
but if it's okay with you, may I have your autograph?

267
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,980
My... my older sister is a great fan of yours.

268
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,390
What's her name?

269
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,700
Asami.

270
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
The kanji character is "Asa" as in morning and "mi" as in beautiful!

271
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,100
My follower, Asami.

272
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,610
Here you go!

273
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,980
Thank you very much!

274
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,780
So now, your older sister

275
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,380
is a member of our evil group.

276
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,680
It's origami!

277
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,790
Hey, hey!

278
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,690
There're so many paper cranes!

279
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,100
You're right!

280
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,600
Did you fold all this, Satan?

281
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,170
Yeah. Sometimes, I do things that humans do

282
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,880
while I'm waiting.

283
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,080
All I got to fold today were those five though.

284
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,380
What's this ruler for?

285
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,890
Using a ruler

286
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,990
helps me fold the cranes neatly and nicely.

287
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,890
But a devil folding origami

288
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,890
is sort of image breaking, isn't it?

289
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,600
Yeah, that's why I tell all my followers

290
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
to keep it a secret.

291
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,100
I tell them that I'll curse them to death

292
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,400
if they let the word out!

293
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,980
Okay!

294
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,680
That's right, Satan.

295
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,080
I found the mirror you were looking for.

296
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,480
Well...

297
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,780
This is the one, right?

298
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,180
Here you go.

299
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,490
This is it, this!

300
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,990
With this, I'll be able to put on make-up

301
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,590
while I'm waiting in the dressing room.

302
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,190
-Thank you! -Not at all.

303
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,100
Is anything the matter?

304
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh, no.

305
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
It's just that my contacts slipped out of place a bit.

306
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,900
Why don't you come in?

307
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,400
Thank you.

308
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,570
Are you okay, Mitsuhiko?

309
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,670
You look nervous.

310
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,080
I... I'm fine.

311
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,280
That's right, and this.

312
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
I also got you eye drops.

313
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,790
You ran out, right?

314
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,590
Yeah, leave them there somewhere.

315
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,690
Okay.

316
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,100
"Tenpuku-tei"

317
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,600
"Eirinan"

318
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
"Janjanken"

319
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,500
The names on the shop of all these plates

320
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,510
are of different shops. Why?

321
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,480
Satan is particular when it comes to where he orders what food.

322
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Well, I guess you can say that the food of humans

323
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,880
rarely suit my taste.

324
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,690
Police car?

325
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,390
An ambulance too.

326
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
I wonder if something happened near here.

327
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,080
It seems that something's happened here at the TV station.

328
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,580
-What? -Here at the TV station?

329
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,890
What the...

330
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,890
Yes?

331
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,390
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,790
We were just about to leave for the studio.

333
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,100
Well, your boss...

334
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Something terrible's happened to your boss!

335
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,900
Anyway! Please come. Come right away!

336
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,700
Please excuse me and open the way.

337
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,070
Satan? Satan Onizuka?

338
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,470
Excuse me!

339
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,880
Satan Onizuka!

340
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,680
-Satan? It's been a long time since I saw him last. -Excuse me!

341
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,890
This way, please.

342
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,590
Boss!

343
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,190
Boss...

344
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Who on earth could've done such a thing?

345
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,770
The victim of the murder is Mr. Tenji Urushibara,

346
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,780
age 47, president of an entertainment production.

347
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,680
The estimated time of his death is around 13:00.

348
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,580
He died of loss of blood from a stab wound.

349
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,390
And, who first discovered the corpse?

350
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,090
Oh, me.

351
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,390
At 14:00, President Urushibara

352
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,990
and the producer of a program that I'm in charge of

353
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,100
was supposed to have a meeting in this reception room, but...

354
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
I came to tell him that the meeting would be later than scheduled.

355
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,600
That's when.

356
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,970
I contacted the police and ambulance right away.

357
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,380
As well as Satan, who just happened to be at this TV station

358
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,980
and belongs to the production run by the president.

359
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,380
Satan?

360
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,880
It's me.

361
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,090
What... what're you?

362
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,490
A Death God?

363
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,790
I'm Satan.

364
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,390
I'm Satan Onizuka, the vocal for Styx III!

365
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,500
Styx III? Santa Onizuka?

366
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Wrong, Inspector!

367
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Oh, I know you.

368
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,200
You're the one in the visual rock band

369
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,100
that used to be popular about 3 or 4 years ago.

370
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,910
Hey, hey. What do you mean "used to be"?

371
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,080
And, do you know if your boss was hated by anyone or not?

372
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
With a personality like his,

373
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm sure there were many who hated him.

374
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,590
I was one of them too.

375
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,190
So then, let me ask you.

376
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,290
At the time of the crime, which was around 13:00,

377
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,490
where were you, and what were you doing?

378
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,190
I was in the dressing room at that time.

379
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,300
He was folding origami!

380
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,200
You guys?

381
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,900
That devil said he was folding origami!

382
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,300
Origami?

383
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,800
He made five paper cranes!

384
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,470
He seems to have been trying to kill time.

385
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,580
But please keep this a secret from everyone.

386
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,480
He's going to curse you to death if you tell.

387
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,180
What? Cursed to death?

388
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
That's what I tell all my fans.

389
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,290
I mean, it really doesn't match for a devil

390
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,090
to have a hobby like origami, does it?

391
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,390
Oh, I see.

392
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,290
Were you here all the while

393
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,190
before these children came to see you?

394
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,400
Yeah, I ate take-out lunch,

395
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,200
took a quick nap, and started folding origami after that.

396
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,810
Which means you were here at the TV station way earlier than scheduled?

397
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,480
I was in the dressing waiting room by 11:00.

398
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,380
I asked my manager to order take-out food

399
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,280
and to go get me some stuff right away.

400
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,180
Yes, when I came back, I saw the children

401
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,490
just about to go into Satan's room,

402
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,190
so at first I stopped them.

403
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,290
Because I was told not to wake him

404
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,590
until time to go into the studio at 14:00.

405
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,890
I see.

406
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,390
Which means you have no alibi

407
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,500
at the time of the crime.

408
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,700
That's right. I couldn't have done it.

409
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,900
If I leave this dressing room with this face,

410
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,000
I would sure stand out, wouldn't I?

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,170
Why don't you gather all the guys at the TV station

412
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,880
and ask them if they've seen me around the time in question?

413
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,780
But if he takes off his make-up

414
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,780
and walks around without anything on...

415
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,480
I see, he could've walked around the TV station without make-up,

416
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,090
headed for the reception room,

417
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,090
and return to his room

418
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,090
after committing the crime then put on his make-up.

419
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,890
I don't think that's possible.

420
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,490
What do you mean?

421
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,390
Does it take a lot of time to put make-up on?

422
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,400
No, it only takes at most about 30 minutes.

423
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,900
Either way, there's no mirror in this dressing room.

424
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Mirror?

425
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,410
There's no mirror?

426
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,280
There seems to be a leading actor who doesn't like mirrors,

427
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,080
that are two or three rooms in at this station with no mirrors.

428
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,880
Satan always uses that place over there.

429
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,190
I don't like mirrors either.

430
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,690
Especially big ones.

431
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,990
Would you like to take a look at the dressing room?

432
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,600
It's true that there's no mirror on the wall.

433
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,210
Inspector!

434
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,280
There's one here!

435
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,080
But this mirror is what I just bought a while ago.

436
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,780
And something that I handed over to Satan

437
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,380
when I came into this room with the children.

438
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,690
Please tell me where that store is.

439
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,290
I'll go confirm.

440
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,290
Okay.

441
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,390
Also, if you would, please let us investigate the dressing room

442
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,990
and Satan's belongings,

443
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,000
as well as his person.

444
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Sure, go ahead.

445
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,600
In the bag... There seems to be make-up cosmetics.

446
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,510
There is no mirror.

447
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,070
He doesn't seem to have any on him.

448
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,980
What's with this dirty top and cap?

449
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,880
It says "Akumaya" on the chest part?

450
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,890
I'm using that for the scene of the talk show

451
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,990
that I'm going to be appearing on today, so I brought it with me.

452
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,690
During my live shows I usually do a stand-up comedy

453
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,190
with the other members between songs.

454
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,090
Hello, we're the Akumaya.

455
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,400
We've come to bring you misfortune.

456
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,800
Like so.

457
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,900
Officer Takagi, will you go confirm this with the program staff?

458
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
Yes, sir.

459
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,600
By the way, I use that make-up kit

460
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,670
to fix my make-up when I'm on air.

461
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,770
If it's to do a slight touch up,

462
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,880
all I have to do is borrow the make-up of the women staff

463
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,780
and fix myself up.

464
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,680
Well, I don't perspire that much,

465
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,580
so I don't really need to touch up too frequently.

466
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,580
But it seems that your purple lipstick

467
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,590
doesn't stay on all that long.

468
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,090
That cigarette butt

469
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,590
with purple lipstick on the filter.

470
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,690
The same color is here and there on the autograph sheet

471
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,800
that you autographed for Mitsuhiko too.

472
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,100
That's true. How come?

473
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,500
Back then, Satan held

474
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,300
the cap of the pen in his mouth and autographed the sheet, right?

475
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,900
That's why the color of his lipstick

476
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,510
smeared off on your hand

477
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,080
from the pen he returned to you, Mitsuhiko.

478
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,780
And since you were holding the autograph sheet all the while,

479
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,480
the color smeared onto the sheet too.

480
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
-Is that so? -I see!

481
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,080
Oh, but strange.

482
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,490
There are no purple smears on the take-out lunch dishes,

483
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,290
chopsticks or spoon that you ate your lunch with.

484
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,490
And yet they are all things you bring to your mouth.

485
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,290
I wonder why?

486
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,000
It... it's true, that's strange.

487
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,100
I lightly wipe off my lipstick when I eat lunch.

488
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't like the color smearing off on my chopsticks and dishes.

489
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,970
Besides, lipstick is not hard to put back on even without a mirror.

490
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,680
Then is that color around your eyes also lipstick?

491
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,880
It's the same purple color.

492
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,080
It's not lipstick,

493
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,880
but color made by the same manufacturer.

494
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,280
Of course I need to use a mirror to put this on, though.

495
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,690
Well, if there's a person who can put this on without using a mirror...

496
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,690
That person for sure is either, really god or the devil!

497
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,390
I guess so.

498
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,700
You like that purple color, don't you, Mr. Devil?

499
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,900
Yeah, I've liked it since the Indies days.

500
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,900
This color can only be made by this manufacturer.

501
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,610
Since today's job is not a live performance,

502
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,770
the white on my face and gray on my cheeks

503
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,180
are water based-type foundation that are easy to get a hold of.

504
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,580
Is anything the matter?

505
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,480
Satan's got dry eye

506
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,880
because he's wearing contacts.

507
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,790
-Here, eye drops. -No, I'm fine.

508
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,690
But your eyes are red.

509
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,290
I'm telling you that I'm fine!

510
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,200
Just leave me alone, will you?

511
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,000
Really. No mirror was found in this room,

512
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,600
in my bag or when I was body checked,

513
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,510
so how do you propose I put on my make-up?

514
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,610
Take-out delivery lunch.

515
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,680
Let's say that after committing the crime,

516
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,180
you gave the mirror that you used to fix your make-up

517
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,690
to one of the men who delivered the food here.

518
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,290
Then all would be okay, right?

519
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
If that method were used, it's possible.

520
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
It's not possible.

521
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,500
I asked the guard about it.

522
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,300
He said that the only delivery service that came before 14:00

523
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,710
were only those three lunch deliveries,

524
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,980
and moreover, they all arrived at around 12:00.

525
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
I already confirmed it just in case,

526
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,180
but all three deliveries brought food at around 12:00,

527
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,380
and Satan seems to have told all of them

528
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,480
to come get the dishes at sundown.

529
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,490
So, the dishes haven't been retrieved yet.

530
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,290
And all three deliverymen said that when they delivered the meal,

531
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,190
Satan was wearing his usual make-up

532
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,690
and nothing was out of the ordinary.

533
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,700
If the delivery services came before the crime was committed,

534
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,700
it would be impossible to give him a mirror after the crime.

535
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,500
The only possibility left is when the AD came to get him,

536
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,700
and on the way rushing over to the reception room,

537
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,770
he threw the mirror that he had on him away.

538
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,380
I don't think that's possible.

539
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,280
I was watching with these very eyes.

540
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,680
All Satan did was run.

541
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,080
I see.

542
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,390
And the manager bought the mirror at about 12:30 noon.

543
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,990
To get here to Nichiuri TV,

544
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,290
it would take at least one hour even by car.

545
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,700
It would be impossible to deliver it beforehand.

546
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,900
The delivery boy costume

547
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,100
was unmistakably scheduled to be used on the program.

548
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,410
And the TV station got the outfit for him too.

549
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,270
But were they really going to shoot a program of him

550
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,380
wearing that make-up in delivery man's outfit?

551
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,180
Everybody seemed to like it when we did a live performance though.

552
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,580
My head is completely reset,

553
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,680
so wearing a cap won't throw it out of place either.

554
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,690
Come to think of it, where did you change into that devil look?

555
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,490
Were you already dressed like that when you came to the dressing room?

556
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,890
At home!

557
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,390
I completed everything at home

558
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,490
and came here by car.

559
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,800
I parked the car in the parking lot and came right up here.

560
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,500
Of course, my manager kept my bag for me.

561
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,300
It doesn't look right for me to be carrying a bag

562
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,800
looking like this, you see.

563
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,100
When you were folding origami, were you smoking?

564
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,710
Yeah. When I do things requiring detail,

565
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,270
I smoke, at times.

566
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,880
Bug you?

567
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,180
Not at all. I was just wondering.

568
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
He's lying.

569
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,090
This man is lying.

570
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,060
The sun's already set.

571
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,260
Yes.

572
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,660
He must be the killer after all.

573
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,660
He probably removed his make-up once,

574
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,460
and went to the boss's room looking his normal self, then killed him.

575
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,570
He then put his make up back on and became the devil again.

576
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,170
The question is, where did he get a hold of the mirror

577
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,370
he needed to put on his make-up and where did he get rid of it?

578
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,880
Although there were several restrooms from here to the reception room,

579
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,380
if he uses the mirror there, people would undoubtedly see him.

580
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,950
If by chance, nobody saw him there,

581
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,050
if he passed this corridor looking the way he is,

582
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,950
somebody is sure to have remembered seeing him.

583
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,660
If he wears something over his head, he would stand out even more.

584
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,560
It's most natural to think that he came back here to this room

585
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,960
and fixed his make-up.

586
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,860
But there's one other thing that's also bothering me.

587
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,570
Those paper cranes.

588
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,170
He says that he couldn't commit the crime because he was folding them.

589
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,770
If he intends to use that as an alibi,

590
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,670
five cranes are too few a number to have finished folding.

591
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,770
Moreover, to establish his alibi,

592
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,470
he lined up what he already made and brought in here.

593
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,980
Which means that if any one of his cranes are squashed,

594
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,580
it would be plain to see.

595
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,580
So, then, what is it? What meaning do the origami and cranes have?

596
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,350
Maybe this is the mirror.

597
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,350
See, this window,

598
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,360
the figures of Genta and Mitsuhiko can clearly be seen.

599
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,660
But take a very close look.

600
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,260
Where is your face, Young Lady?

601
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,270
See, it's dark so you can't see clearly, can you?

602
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,370
Yeah, it's true!

603
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,370
Getting closer to the mirror makes it dark so that you can't see well.

604
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,970
The crime was committed around 13:00 in the afternoon.

605
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,680
It's still lighted outside.

606
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,680
It won't serve as a mirror unless it becomes dark, right?

607
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,750
I see. That's why he used the origami.

608
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,350
I finally figured out

609
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,050
the trick of how you returned back to your devil appearance!

610
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,260
Doc, where were you?

611
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,760
I'm sorry, my cell phone ran out of battery,

612
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,560
so I was contacting everybody's residence by public phone.

613
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,970
Officer.

614
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,670
Haven't you got your answer already?

615
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,170
If I walk around the TV station looking like this,

616
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,670
someone is bound to notice.

617
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,770
Like I said a while ago,

618
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,380
if I killed the boss...

619
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
In order to go to the reception room two floors up,

620
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
I'd have to remove my make-up once

621
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,850
and come back here after committing the crime,

622
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,350
then put my make-up back on again.

623
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,650
But look,

624
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,160
there is no mirror in this dressing room.

625
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,760
Of course there is none in my bag,

626
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,160
or anywhere on me!

627
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,860
The only mirror there is, is the one my manager went out to get for me.

628
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,160
That's the only mirror there is,

629
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,370
but it was given to me after the crime, wasn't it?

630
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,670
I already had make-up on at that time.

631
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,770
I looked just like this, right?

632
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,770
Yes, not only did I see him,

633
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,180
but the children were there too.

634
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,580
I can't draw this face without a mirror.

635
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,580
You're right.

636
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,550
If so, ever since I came to this TV station today,

637
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,050
I looked this way right through.

638
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,760
So, leave me alone to grieve over the death of my boss.

639
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,060
I can't cry in front of people being that I'm a devil.

640
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,360
You're right.

641
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,760
Okay, then.

642
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,270
At least let me take off my make-up.

643
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,370
All I need is three minutes.

644
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,770
If it's not my face,

645
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,070
nobody would know it's me even if I shed tears.

646
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,270
I see.

647
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:49,180
You're planning to remove it along with your make-up?

648
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:55,550
The evidence that had turned you into a real devil...

649
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,750
The scarlet red trace of crime!

650
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,330
Hey! Gramps.

651
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,630
He's using my voice again without permission.

652
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,330
What sort of joke is this supposed to be?

653
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,630
It's not funny.

654
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,690
It's true that you couldn't go with that appearance of yours,

655
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,390
but if you remove your make-up

656
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,390
and wear the outfit of the deliveryman,

657
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,990
no one would notice that it's you.

658
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:25,200
That's why you ordered three different dishes from three different shops.

659
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,500
In other words, just around the time of the crime,

660
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,600
three deliverymen would be going in and out of here.

661
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,010
You mixed yourself among them and committed the crime.

662
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,510
And if the clothing that each of the deliverymen

663
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,210
are wearing similar the better.

664
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,510
The people who saw them,

665
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,280
wouldn't go out of their way to remember the face of each man.

666
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,380
Then, don't tell me

667
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,780
that the outfit of the delivery person that was in his bag back then was...

668
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,790
Right.

669
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,590
He used the outfit Akumaya that he was going to use on his talk show.

670
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,890
You're talking as if you saw what actually happened.

671
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,890
Exactly.

672
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,300
I was watching,

673
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,800
back then, at the queer delivery man who ran through

674
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,600
without holding any delivery box in hand.

675
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
"Rairaiken" -I see.

676
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,210
Any delivery man would normally be holding a delivery box.

677
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,210
Of course, when he comes and when he leaves.

678
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,410
But this is a TV station.

679
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,680
Maybe an actor wearing that sort of outfit happened to pass by?

680
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,180
I thought so for an instant too.

681
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,780
But no matter how small the role,

682
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,290
a little bit of make-up would be used.

683
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,590
However, that man didn't have any make-up on whatsoever.

684
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,790
More than anything else, in the view from under the cap,

685
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,690
was the back part of the man's head,

686
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,300
which was the same upside-down "V" mark as that of Satan.

687
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,600
But you have no evidence that the delivery man was I, do you?

688
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,110
There are some people with their hair shaved like mine, here and there.

689
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,810
The guy could even have been one of my fans.

690
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,880
Besides, even if I were able to come back after killing the boss,

691
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,080
how on earth do you propose I redid my make-up?

692
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,390
It's true that there's no mirror in this room.

693
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,190
Then all you need to do is make one

694
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,190
by using a transparent plate.

695
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,590
Transparent.

696
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
Plate?

697
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,000
If you're talking about this glass window, it's impossible.

698
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,300
As the children mentioned earlier,

699
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,400
if you get close enough to put make-up on,

700
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,900
his face would be shadowed out of view.

701
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,410
Besides, the murder was committed in the afternoon,

702
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,210
when not much can be reflected on the glass.

703
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,810
I've figured it out!

704
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,810
The killer didn't use glass.

705
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,080
He used that ruler!

706
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,780
-Ruler? -But how?

707
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,690
The same way as the window glass!

708
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,490
All he has to do is use this origami to make it night time.

709
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,590
What? Will that really make a mirror?

710
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,100
Try it! Try it!

711
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,000
Things like window glass and transparent plastic

712
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,300
are always reflecting light and projecting something.

713
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,000
Nothing's reflected, though.

714
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,110
That's just because the light on this side is strong

715
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,710
and it isn't clearly visible.

716
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,210
But if you use black origami like this

717
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,880
and block the light coming from this side...

718
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,480
You can really see!

719
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,590
It's true! Wow!

720
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,390
It's just like a mirror!

721
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,090
By the way, since a thing that is reflected on the window glass at night

722
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,490
will become shadowed,

723
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,990
it is hard to make out since it is dark.

724
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,100
But the thing that is reflected,

725
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,000
unlike the genuine one is monotone.

726
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,300
It's hard to make out color this way.

727
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,100
Then, maybe this silver color should be used.

728
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,110
See, this way, you can tell the colors apart.

729
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,510
But it's blurred and hard to see.

730
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,180
The color silver originally has the power to reflect things.

731
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
But since the surface of the paper is not smooth,

732
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,980
it looks blurred.

733
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,490
Besides, there's no need to make out color.

734
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,990
Satan's make-up only requires coloring the same places

735
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,890
with the respective corresponding colors.

736
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,090
I see.

737
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,290
Then he can put on make-up here.

738
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,200
Yes. In other words, Satan's crime began

739
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,500
right after the three delivery lunches that he ordered were delivered.

740
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,300
He removes his make-up immediately,

741
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,200
and goes to the reception room where the president is,

742
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,600
wearing his delivery man's outfit.

743
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,610
Then, after killing him, rushes back here,

744
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,010
uses the ruler mirror that he made to put his make-up back on,

745
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,680
and waits for the manager to come wake him up.

746
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,380
But if so,

747
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,080
there should be a lot of the president's blood

748
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,590
splattered on the delivery man's outfit.

749
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,090
I'm sure he probably got some other clothing ready.

750
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,390
Let's say, maybe something like a hooded raincoat.

751
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,800
Okay! Dispatch the investigation crew and look for it!

752
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,200
Yes, sir!

753
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
Who cares, even if you find something like that.

754
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,910
I didn't do it, and besides, you don't have proof either.

755
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,810
I made a mirror using origami and a ruler, you say.

756
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,710
That's news to me.

757
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,280
All I was doing in this room was make paper cranes

758
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,880
while waiting for my manager to come, and that's it!

759
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,190
If so, won't you fold and make another paper crane for me?

760
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,190
What?

761
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,690
If you want, you may smoke too.

762
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,290
You get the urge to smoke when doing detailed work, don't you?

763
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,800
Don't be silly.

764
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,100
I could never fold a paper crane in this situation.

765
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,000
Then, Ayumi, please make one for him, will you?

766
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Okay.

767
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,210
First, you make a triangle.

768
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,210
Then, you go like this.

769
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,710
You're good, Ayumi.

770
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,310
Because when Daddy was in the hospital,

771
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,280
I made a lot of cranes together with mommy.

772
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,880
Here, all done.

773
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,380
It's a well-made crane,

774
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,890
but it's skinny and doesn't look too energetic.

775
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,190
Oh, I see.

776
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,790
I see, that's right.

777
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,490
In order to make the crane fat,

778
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,500
you must blow air into.

779
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
If the crane was placed against your lips,

780
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,300
the lipstick should come off onto the crane.

781
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,400
Just like the cigarette stubs in the astray.

782
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,200
But none of it was found on your cranes.

783
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,910
In other words, those aren't the cranes that he folded today, right?

784
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,110
Dr. Agasa, what're you persuading yourself for?

785
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,380
It seems that either Satan doesn't know how to fold cranes,

786
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,890
or has forgotten how to.

787
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,490
Either way, those cranes were folded beforehand

788
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,690
in order to camouflage the mirror trick.

789
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,690
By the way, he went out of his way to tell the police

790
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,500
that he also feels hate towards his boss

791
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,100
so that they would suspect him

792
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
and investigate the dressing room right away,

793
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,900
and find that there is no mirror around.

794
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,410
He didn't want to dilly-dally

795
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,710
because the three shops that delivered the food

796
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,810
may come to retrieve the dishes.

797
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,010
If they come, the fact that there is no mirror in the room

798
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,310
may be thrown into obscurity.

799
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,380
That's why he wanted them to come get the dishes at sundown.

800
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,590
He did so to make time for us to check the room!

801
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,690
It... it's a lie!

802
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,790
Satan would never kill, no way.

803
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,890
Then, let's have him remove his make-up right now

804
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,600
and show us his face.

805
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,300
Sure, okay!

806
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Satan, go ahead and remove your make-up!

807
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,500
Satan?

808
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,410
Sorry, but I can't do that, manager.

809
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,810
Because if I take off this devil's mask,

810
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,780
under it will be the wretched face of a killer.

811
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,280
No, don't tell me that...

812
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,090
You know, don't you? About three years ago,

813
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,890
when I hurt my throat during a tour and was hospitalized.

814
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,700
Back then, there was a child who used to come visit me every day.

815
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,700
There used to always be a small box

816
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,500
with a crane inside it, each time she came.

817
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,100
She believed that I was a real devil.

818
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,410
I always looked forward to reading her letters.

819
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,510
But suddenly one day,

820
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,380
the letters from that girl stopped coming.

821
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Back then, I thought that she had just gotten tired of me.

822
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,190
But last month, when I went drinking with boss,

823
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,390
I finally found out why.

824
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,590
In his exact words, the boss said,

825
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,590
"Wanna cause a stir again with sacrifice?"

826
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,800
Sacrifice?

827
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,500
Right. I was in the hospital and didn't know,

828
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,400
but the boss wrote a comment in the band's official website,

829
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,700
pretending to be me, without telling me about it.

830
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,310
He wrote, "It is necessary to make a sacrifice to recover my evil powers.

831
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,010
I want blood."

832
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,210
Don't... don't tell me

833
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,510
that child who was your fan took it seriously and...

834
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,390
Yeah, when I pressured him for an answer on the spot,

835
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,890
he laughed and said the following.

836
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,590
In the last letter it said, "I will happily give you my blood. Goodbye."

837
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,090
The revival live that I performed six months later

838
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,500
after being discharged from the hospital,

839
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,800
was really hot over the fact that someone had taken her life for me.

840
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,100
I looked for that girl's house right away and visited her residence.

841
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,810
I found out that she died by killing herself over an unknown reason.

842
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,610
Then, you killed him to avenge her death.

843
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,410
Yeah, I did it.

844
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,580
He thinks nothing of human life if for the sake of money.

845
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,980
He even crushed my plans of holding a final live performance,

846
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,790
telling me to pay for damages incurred

847
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,690
if I quit before my contract is over!

848
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,990
I killed the real devil!

849
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,300
I mean although I seem to have my righteous reasons for doing what I did,

850
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,400
the fact is, these past one to two years I've been in a slump.

851
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,600
I've been annoyed

852
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,600
and maybe the fact is, I just wanted to get everything over with.

853
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,110
But my older sister was saying

854
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,810
Styx III is going to revive for sure.

855
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,310
She said that she was sure you'd be making a wondrous song

856
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,780
that will give everyone energy again!

857
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,680
I'm no good anymore.

858
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,590
I used to frequently say, "I'll possess you" or "I'll curse you",

859
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,690
"but I never ever said "die".

860
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,990
The only one who says something like that,

861
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,290
is the monster that comes on in the Kamen Yaiba show.

862
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,800
I've fallen low to that level.

863
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,900
But that's...

864
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,000
Besides, after her letters stopped coming,

865
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,500
I got to thinking.

866
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,510
What did I do wrong,

867
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,110
or what did she not like about me?

868
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,210
When I started thinking this way, tears started pourings

869
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,580
and I couldn't compose nor write lyrics.

870
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,580
I couldn't write even a phrase.

871
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
Phooey, talk about a fallen devil.

872
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,790
Your tears are a bit red?

873
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,790
That's President Urushibara's blood that splattered on him.

874
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,790
Blood?

875
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,800
You couldn't see colors very well using the ruler mirror, right?

876
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,400
So, you put foundation

877
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,210
right over the blood by your eyes without noticing.

878
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,910
You noticed it only after

879
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,010
your manager bought the mirror and gave it to you.

880
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,580
That's why you couldn't use eye drops.

881
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,280
Because if you did, the eye drop

882
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,380
would wet the area around your eyes, resulting in conclusive evidence.

883
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,490
-I see. -I see.

884
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,390
Shall we go then?

885
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,090
But it sure is like a fairy tale.

886
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,700
Well, like they say,

887
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,900
"When a devil sheds tears,

888
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,400
he loses his evil powers".

889
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,690
Now, something very shocking has happened!

890
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,700
Ms. Kazuka Inoue, Yoko Okino and Azusa Yamamoto

891
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,200
-have aligned in a row with nine correct answers! -You can do it!

892
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
There is only one more question to go.

893
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
If any one of the three answers correctly,

894
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,710
she will be the winner!

895
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,410
This program was shot

896
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,310
when you went to the TV station the other day, right?

897
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,080
Yes, but I didn't get to see Yoko after the incident,

898
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,380
so I don't know how it turned out.

899
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,080
What else can the result be,

900
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,580
but Yoko answering ten questions correctly

901
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,890
and winning first prize?

902
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,390
Ms. Inoue, do you have confidence?

903
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,990
I'll do my best!

904
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,390
Ms. Okino.

905
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,800
My fans out there.

906
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,200
Root for me, okay?

907
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,600
Of course, of course! I'll root for you!

908
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,500
Ms. Yamamoto?

909
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,200
I will do my best!

910
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Here goes.

911
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,810
Question number 10!

912
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:53,410
Conan Doyle brings to mind Sherlock Holmes,

913
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,280
Masashi Yokomizo brings to mind Kousuke Kindaiji.

914
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,480
Then what does Ranpo Edogawa bring to mind?

915
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,390
-She did it! -Yes, Ms. Okino.

916
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,000
Akechi, Akechi!

917
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,200
Too bad, Ms. Okino, you're disqualified.

918
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,100
The top prize winners are Ms. Kazuka Inoue and Ms. Azusa Yamamoto!

919
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,700
Let's give them a bit hand!

920
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,500
-Congratulations! -Congratulations for both winner.

921
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,710
Oh boy.

922
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,510
How could she say such a name?

923
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,010
Kogoro Mouri!

924
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,180
How disappointing.

925
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,200
Next Conan's Hint:

926
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,380
"Roma letters".

927
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,880
The next episode involves a spider house.

928
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,840
Are there going to be that many spies?

929
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,060
He's talking about the insect!
