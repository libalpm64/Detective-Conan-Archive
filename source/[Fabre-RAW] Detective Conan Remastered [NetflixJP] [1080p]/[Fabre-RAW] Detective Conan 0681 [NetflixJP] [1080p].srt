1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,505
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,605
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,305
The curtains are raised after 18 years.

4
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:09,305
Is it a love story of two police officers?

5
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:11,005
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,905
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:15,995
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:02,944
"A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Start of the Broadcast)"

9
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:19,644
Hey, you detective over there!

10
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:21,244
Yumi.

11
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:22,444
Are you staking out from now?

12
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:26,125
No, I finished work early today.

13
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,844
I have some place I have to go now.

14
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,844
Well, I'll come back after just a one night's stay.

15
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:33,444
Oh, what's that about?

16
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,344
Are you going on a hot spring date with Miwako or what?

17
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,044
No.

18
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,141
It's not a date.

19
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,544
No way. Miwako, even you don't know

20
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,144
where Officer Takagi is going?

21
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,244
Yes, it seems that he told Inspector Megure

22
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:53,344
that he had to relay something to somebody.

23
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:56,744
Maybe it's your parents or something?

24
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,144
Maybe he's going to tell them, "Please let me marry your daughter".

25
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:00,744
Now, look here.

26
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:03,744
If that's the case, why did he have to keep it a secret from me?

27
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,844
Besides, my mother lives in Tokyo,

28
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:08,167
so there's no need for him to spend the night over.

29
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:11,144
By the way, who are you?

30
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:13,044
I'm Naeko Miike who was transferred over

31
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:16,175
from the Haido Police Office.

32
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,244
-Is that right? -But I'm sure

33
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:21,044
that Inspector Megure already knows who that person is.

34
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,644
It seems like he really hasn't told him anything yet.

35
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:25,244
He only told him, "I'll tell you about it, after I return

36
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,844
and my feelings are settled."

37
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:29,744
Something smells fishy.

38
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,144
Right? Don't you think so?

39
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,944
Well, I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with love or things like that.

40
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:36,944
He clearly said that he wasn't going on a date, after all.

41
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:38,197
Geez.

42
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:40,844
I wonder if he really remembers

43
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:42,844
Mr. Date's memorial day?

44
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:46,205
Come to think of it, it has been almost a year.

45
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,544
He told me that he'd go pay a visit to his grave with me, and yet...

46
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:51,544
Who are you talking about?

47
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:54,213
The police detective that used to be Officer Takagi's mentor.

48
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,544
He was a tough guy that you couldn't kill even if you wanted to.

49
00:03:57,544 --> 00:04:01,244
And yet, he was involved in a traffic accident and died just like that.

50
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:03,444
Then maybe he had something he wanted to report

51
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,225
to the parents of the detective?

52
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,544
No, Mr. Date's parents also live in Tokyo.

53
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:13,144
If so, maybe it has to do with a woman or something after all.

54
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,244
Come to think of it, Officer Takagi

55
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:18,244
is quite popular in the transportation department.

56
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:22,544
Well, he's not as popular as Miwako though.

57
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:24,644
That Takagi...

58
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,144
Darn it, maybe I caught a cold.

59
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,944
Procedures shall begin for passengers

60
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:39,044
who are boarding Luna Airlines flight number 299 for Tottori

61
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:42,844
departing at 19:35.

62
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,644
Those who are boarding the plane,

63
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:47,544
"Meet with parents" -please go to boarding gate number 18.

64
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,344
Officer Sato, I...

65
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:08,844
I'm losing confidence that I can make you happy.

66
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,844
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

67
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,544
finally did it, didn't we?

68
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:15,244
"Police Station" -What an honor to be selected as models

69
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:17,444
for the children crime prevention pamphlet!

70
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:20,299
Yeah! We did solve a lot of crimes after all!

71
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:24,303
What should we do? We're going to be famous!

72
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,844
But I wonder if Doc's okay.

73
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:30,309
He said he'd come right after parking his car in the parking lot.

74
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,244
He was really coughing up a storm, so...

75
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,644
I wonder if he has a cold?

76
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:37,644
Officer Takagi is late, too.

77
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:40,944
He told me to call him when we get to the MPD,

78
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:43,044
so that he could take us over to the PR section in charge.

79
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:44,944
But I can't get through to him at all.

80
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:49,044
Maybe he's caught up in a lovey-dovey situation again?

81
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,644
Maybe he's having a kiss like he did back then.

82
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:54,333
Even Officer Takagi wouldn't do something like that

83
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,644
during working hours!

84
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:56,944
That's right!

85
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,337
Excuse me.

86
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,644
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

87
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,544
What?

88
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:05,644
Yes, we do. But why?

89
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:07,644
I couldn't have asked for better.

90
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:12,744
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

91
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:16,044
Could you do so for me?

92
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:20,344
Are you referring to Officer Sato whom we were just talking about?

93
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,344
Do you mean you also know that female detective?

94
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:24,363
Yes.

95
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,144
She's strong and scary like an ogre though.

96
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,367
Well, well...

97
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,044
But she's very pretty, too!

98
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:32,044
That's right!

99
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:34,944
I'm sure they're getting married soon!

100
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,844
-Right! -They're really in love, you see!

101
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:42,844
Then, please relay this message from him to the happy female detective.

102
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:47,344
He said that it's perishable, so open it as soon as you can.

103
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,344
He also said that it will be no good

104
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:53,144
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

105
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:55,044
Hey!

106
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,444
Conan!

107
00:06:57,444 --> 00:07:00,399
Okay, I'm counting on you guys.

108
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,044
Who is that guy?

109
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:04,403
He seems to be an acquaintance of Officer Takagi.

110
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,944
By the way, where are Doc and Ai?

111
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:09,344
It seems that Doc has a cold after all.

112
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,444
I asked him to go home with Ai.

113
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:13,144
What?

114
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,244
Well, Doc's acting sick

115
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:19,444
because he can't allow Ai's picture to be put on the pamphlet.

116
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,344
So, does that mean Ai's not going to appear on it?

117
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:22,421
That's too bad.

118
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,444
I'm disappointed, too.

119
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:29,744
I thought that I'd get to see the much rumored Dr. Agasa.

120
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,444
Mr. Amuro.

121
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,644
I heard from Master Mouri

122
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:35,944
that the members of the Youth Detective Squad

123
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:38,044
would be coming over to the MPD on Dr. Agasa's car today

124
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:41,644
to take pictures to be put on the pamphlet.

125
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:45,144
I was told to come to the MPD, too.

126
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:47,144
I've already finished what I had to do though.

127
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,447
Why were you told to come here?

128
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,744
It was about the case back when you were kidnapped,

129
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:55,444
and I stopped the car that you were in by crashing into it.

130
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:57,544
They were questioning me again,

131
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,044
saying that I might have gone overboard.

132
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,444
Come to think of it,

133
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:05,244
Masumi also said that she was told to come to the MPD again.

134
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:09,244
In her case, she absolutely went overboard.

135
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:11,244
Well, I also came here

136
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,544
because I had something else to do.

137
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,044
Something else to do?

138
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,544
Don't worry about it.

139
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:20,479
Because I don't have to do it anymore.

140
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:22,481
Conan.

141
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,483
Who was the young man?

142
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,844
He's the private detective who became Pop Kogoro's disciple.

143
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:30,489
A detective?

144
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,491
He's good-looking.

145
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,144
By the way, isn't Officer Takagi here yet?

146
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:37,544
It seems like he's forgotten.

147
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:39,744
I can't get through to him either.

148
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:43,044
Then, why don't we try calling Officer Chiba?

149
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,503
If so...

150
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,505
Let's call Officer Sato!

151
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,144
Since this is perishable.

152
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,511
What?

153
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,844
Officer Takagi was in tears while looking at the mini photo

154
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,515
he had attached on his memo pad?

155
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,844
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:00,944
It looked like a cute photo at first glance,

157
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:04,044
so I asked him if that photo was of you, Officer Sato.

158
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,544
Cut the joke!

159
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,244
And he got really angry at me.

160
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:09,944
"Cut the joke"?

161
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,844
He told me not to say anything

162
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,144
because he wanted to explain it himself.

163
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,544
Hey! Where is Officer Takagi?

164
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:20,844
I wonder, too. I haven't seen him yet today.

165
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:28,944
Yes, hello.

166
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,144
Conan?

167
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:34,544
Officer Takagi has something for me?

168
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:37,044
Did the unknown man say that to you?

169
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,444
-Yeah. -Here it is!

170
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,244
What is going on here?

171
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:42,844
He hasn't even shown up at work yet.

172
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:45,144
Officer Takagi isn't here yet?

173
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:47,544
That man told us that it's perishable,

174
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,544
so he told us to eat it by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

175
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:53,244
But this tablet doesn't look edible.

176
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,044
It's a tablet.

177
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:58,044
It could be a video letter, then.

178
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:00,844
I'm sure he was too embarrassed to tell you in person.

179
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:04,044
Officer Takagi is shy, you see.

180
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,585
Seriously. If you have something to tell me,

181
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,587
why can't you say it directly to me?

182
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,944
O... Officer Takagi!

183
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,044
There's a rope tied around his neck!

184
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,595
If so, he can't get away.

185
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:20,599
But if he's just tied up and lying down...

186
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,601
-It switched. -Yes.

187
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,603
It's taken from a different camera angle.

188
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:25,944
Wait... Wait a second!

189
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,844
If he turns over and falls...

190
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,244
He'll be strangled and get killed!

191
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:31,644
Get up, Officer Takagi!

192
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,844
Get up and get a hold of your circumstances!

193
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,044
Officer Takagi.

194
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,623
Where...

195
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:49,744
Where is this place?

196
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,296
Calm down. Calm down.

197
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,496
Think. Try to recall

198
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,396
how things turned out this way.

199
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:04,296
If I remember correctly, I met with that person last night,

200
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,296
and was told that he wanted to show me some scenery,

201
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:08,647
so he brought me here.

202
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,996
Then, I was suddenly drugged from behind.

203
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,653
But why?

204
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,396
Don't tell me that he wanted to...

205
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:19,896
Which means that the image on this camera

206
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,096
is being sent to the MPD.

207
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:23,496
What?

208
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,396
Officer Takagi was kidnapped by someone?

209
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,696
Yes, sir! This is the image of him.

210
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:32,096
Officer Takagi!

211
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:34,196
The camera switched over?

212
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:36,096
There are probably three cameras.

213
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:40,096
The shots are taken from the front, the side, and below.

214
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,196
They seem to be streamed randomly.

215
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:44,683
Can you tell where the images are being sent from?

216
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,296
Yes, if we let the cyber crime department handle this.

217
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:51,596
I don't think anything can be done right away.

218
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:52,996
Conan!

219
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:55,796
The only thing that can be done with that tablet

220
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:56,996
is to switch the image on and off

221
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:59,896
by pressing the button on the front of it.

222
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,496
It's made so that everything else including the touch panel,

223
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:06,496
power switch and the connector to charge it cannot be used.

224
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,296
But Conan.

225
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:10,396
If we disassemble this tablet,

226
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,996
it can be charged directly from the inside.

227
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,696
The data can also be transferred from the hard disk.

228
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,696
Wouldn't we at least be able to figure out

229
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,196
where the information is being sent from?

230
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,719
What if we aren't able

231
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,723
to view Officer Takagi's footage after we disassembled it?

232
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,996
The culprit has remodeled the button,

233
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,196
and embedded a program to invalidate the functions

234
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,696
of the touch panel and all, you know?

235
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:33,896
So, it'd be safer to think that this device is rigged

236
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,296
so that the image would be cut off,

237
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:38,196
and will never boot again if it is disassembled.

238
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,396
Well, we could contact the provider

239
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:45,696
and trace the tablet without having to go through something so risky.

240
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,196
But culprits that carry out something like this

241
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:50,296
would most likely be using a server abroad,

242
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:52,496
so I think it would be difficult to trace the origin of the transmission

243
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:54,753
in a short time.

244
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:59,196
That's what Shinichi told me when I discussed this over the phone

245
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,759
with him a while ago.

246
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,761
But if it's possible to trace it,

247
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,396
even if we have to spend some time...

248
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:08,767
But the time limit is tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, right?

249
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,296
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

250
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:14,773
The man who gave the tablet to Genta and the others said so.

251
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:17,796
He told them that it's perishable, so it should be opened quickly.

252
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,196
Otherwise, it'll become no good tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

253
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:23,196
What... What on earth does that mean?

254
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:27,696
It probably means that if he's left as is, tied up and all...

255
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,396
Without water or food, he won't make it past the third day.

256
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:33,896
In other words, we only have until the day after tomorrow.

257
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,496
But why does Officer Takagi have to go through something like this?

258
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:42,396
He's not the type that would be hated by people.

259
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:45,196
Being hated is an inevitable trait of any police detective.

260
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:47,796
You'd never know when and where someone would hold a grudge against you.

261
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:50,296
Superintendent Matsumoto!

262
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,496
Megure, is it true that Officer Takagi said

263
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,396
that he'd be staying overnight somewhere to meet someone?

264
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:57,396
Yes, sir.

265
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:59,696
He was concerned about the timetable of the monorail,

266
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,096
so he probably went to Haneda Airport.

267
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:05,596
Then, contact Haneda Airport and find out if there was anyone

268
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,396
by the name of Wataru Takagi among last night's passengers.

269
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:09,996
Yes, sir!

270
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,296
Shiratori, go to Takagi's residence,

271
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:15,896
check the mails on his computer and his mailbox

272
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,596
and figure out who he was planning to see.

273
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:22,096
-Yes, sir. -Chiba, keep watch over the tablet.

274
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,843
-Yes, sir! -Don't keep it on for too long.

275
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,845
If we can't charge it,

276
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,296
it means we can only watch the image

277
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,896
for less than 10 hours.

278
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:32,096
Turn it on for only 10 minutes per hour,

279
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:35,196
then record the video while you're checking it.

280
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:38,496
We have to find something to identify his location.

281
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:41,196
Yes... Yes, sir! I'll get to it right away!

282
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,496
Superintendent.

283
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:47,496
-What about... -Sato, go and question the children

284
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,867
who are waiting in the other room.

285
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,096
Yes, sir!

286
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,996
After all, they're vital witnesses

287
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:54,296
who were in contact with the suspect.

288
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,296
Ask them what the suspect looked like,

289
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,896
his habits and also his usage of words.

290
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,696
Don't leave out anything!

291
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:00,879
Yes, sir.

292
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,296
Everyone else, go and find all the people whom Takagi came across

293
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,885
during his investigations.

294
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,996
Whether it's the suspects or victims, find everybody, understand?

295
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,296
Yes, sir...

296
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,897
Officer Sato, let's go.

297
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:25,696
No matter what, I give you my word that I'll rescue you.

298
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,196
Hang on, Officer Takagi!

299
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:38,596
I see. So that's the story.

300
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,296
That's why that person brought me to a place like this.

301
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:43,896
If that's the case, even if it's scary,

302
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,796
I've got no choice but to do it.

303
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,296
Then, let me confirm once again.

304
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,096
A man who looked like this

305
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:56,496
handed that tablet to you?

306
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:57,596
Yeah.

307
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:00,939
First, he asked us if we knew Officer Wataru Takagi.

308
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,941
We replied that we do.

309
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,596
Then, he told us to give it

310
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,996
to Officer Takagi's girlfriend.

311
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:11,396
Then, it could be someone who holds a grudge against me, too.

312
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,896
I don't think so.

313
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:16,955
The culprit seems to know Officer Takagi by his first name,

314
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:21,896
and yet he only knows you as Officer Takagi's girlfriend.

315
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,896
Then, was there anything about his habits

316
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,596
or usage of words that bothered you?

317
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:27,796
There wasn't anything unusual, right?

318
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:28,967
-Yeah. -Yeah.

319
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,696
Bad news, Officer Sato!

320
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,971
Officer Takagi...

321
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,975
Officer Sato!

322
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:45,696
Officer Takagi. Officer Takagi!

323
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:50,989
What's this situation all about?

324
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,991
Why does it look as if he's about to fall?

325
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,996
I was trying to record the third image we received today,

326
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:58,396
and then I saw this.

327
00:16:58,396 --> 00:16:59,896
But why?

328
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,996
He has been like this for many hours already.

329
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:05,596
It's understandable that he'd surrender to despair.

330
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,396
Get a hold of yourself! Officer Takagi...

331
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:17,696
His police memo book.

332
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:21,596
Hey, if somebody picks that up and reports it to the police,

333
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:25,023
we'll be able to figure out where Officer Takagi is.

334
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:29,496
It's okay. It seems like Officer Takagi's in control.

335
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,396
You... You're right.

336
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:40,796
Hey! What on earth's going on?

337
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:44,196
Wataru Takagi's wasn't on any flight

338
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,496
departing from Haneda last night.

339
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:49,047
No clues were found in Takagi's residence either,

340
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,796
and there are no cases

341
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:53,396
that seem related to what's happening now.

342
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,055
Well...

343
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,496
What is it?

344
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,096
Come to think of it,

345
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,061
I happened to see Takagi coming out from the reference room last week.

346
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,096
What?

347
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,596
The thing is, he was in tears.

348
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:10,796
So I wondered what documents he was looking through.

349
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:11,996
Okay.

350
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:15,396
Bring all those documents before me!

351
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:16,396
Yes, sir...

352
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,396
All the case documents that Officer Takagi was looking through that day

353
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,081
involved cases of women

354
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,296
who hung themselves to death about a year ago?

355
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,896
Yes.

356
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:29,496
There are three cases in total.

357
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,496
They were all concluded as non-criminal cases,

358
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:33,996
and were handed over to the district police station.

359
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:37,096
What were the three cases like?

360
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,296
If I remember correctly, one of them was Ms. Yuko Takugi,

361
00:18:40,296 --> 00:18:43,101
a sixth-year medical student at Tohto University.

362
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,796
The place where she committed suicide

363
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,396
was the living room of her condo.

364
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:48,396
It didn't look much like a woman's room,

365
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,596
but it was neat and tidy.

366
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,111
Based on the will that was found near her feet,

367
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,896
it is written that she ran over somebody a few days before that,

368
00:18:56,896 --> 00:19:00,696
and she couldn't bear the guilt any longer.

369
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:03,896
The second one was a teacher at an English conversation school,

370
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:07,396
whose mother was American. Her name was Ms. Natalie Kuruma.

371
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,896
Based on what was written on the calendar in her room,

372
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:14,196
she had been dating her boyfriend every day.

373
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,896
But after being dumped by him, she seemed to have fallen to despair.

374
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,137
She seemed to have planned a date with him

375
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,896
the day she committed suicide.

376
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,796
How could you tell that?

377
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,896
From her cell phone.

378
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:30,296
The dispatched police squad that got there before us

379
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,996
told us that it was written in the English text mail

380
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,996
that she sent to her mother.

381
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:37,155
The third woman was Ms. Kyoka Hikoue,

382
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,196
the number-one hostess at a bar in Roppongi.

383
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,096
It seems she was making a lot of money and yet,

384
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:43,996
she lived in an old apartment.

385
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,896
Her room was filled with empty beer cans.

386
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,167
According to her diary, she found out that the boyfriend

387
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,169
she was helping out financially was a marriage swindler.

388
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,171
So, she hung herself to death in despair.

389
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,496
Was that swindler arrested?

390
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:59,177
Yes, not under the charge of swindling, but murder.

391
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,396
He seems to have been swarmed with debts

392
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:03,896
and got into trouble with black market loan sharks,

393
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:05,196
and ended up stabbing someone.

394
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:09,187
If I remember correctly, it was Officer Date who arrested him.

395
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:10,296
Officer Date?

396
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:13,596
Right. You've never met him, haven't you, Conan?

397
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:17,195
Officer Date died in a traffic accident

398
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,296
immediately after he arrested that swindler.

399
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,201
Officer Date was trying to pick up a memo book,

400
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,996
when a driver who fell asleep at the wheels ran over him.

401
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:27,996
That's what Officer Takagi said.

402
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:30,396
-Officer Takagi said so? -Yes.

403
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,496
Officer Takagi was at the scene, too.

404
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:35,213
They were staking out all night

405
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,496
and were on their way home in the morning.

406
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:40,696
I heard that he was run over when he tried to show Officer Takagi

407
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,196
something in the memo book.

408
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,996
You know, the black memo book that Officer Takagi is always using.

409
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:49,227
It's a keepsake of Officer Date that was handed over to him.

410
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,696
He worked hard to fill it up until there was no space to write in it.

411
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:54,496
And he used to say with enthusiasm that he wanted to become

412
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,996
a police detective like Officer Date soon.

413
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:00,196
Officer Takagi and the other officer got along well, didn't they?

414
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,239
Yes.

415
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,896
Officer Date was Officer Takagi's mentor.

416
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,596
Officer Date used to call the two of them "The Wataru Brothers".

417
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:10,396
Why were they called "Brothers"?

418
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:14,396
Because Officer Date's full name was Wataru Date.

419
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:18,196
His first name was Wataru, the same as Officer Takagi's.

420
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,696
Well, they both had the name, "Wataru",

421
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,996
but unlike Officer Takagi who wasn't very into women,

422
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:25,263
Officer Date loved to pursue them.

423
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,265
Although he was only a year older than me,

424
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,896
Officer Date looked much older.

425
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,696
Don't tell me that...

426
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:35,273
Don't tell me that the reason Officer Takagi was kidnapped was...

427
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,360
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,200
"Crow"

429
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,660
What's going to become of me?

430
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,142
Don't worry, this happens quite often.

431
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:29,740
It's not something you'd hope to happen often.
