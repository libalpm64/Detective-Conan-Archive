1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,540
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,540
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,240
Sonoko's world in Karuizawa.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,140
A troublesome case as expected.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,360
Hey! Ran!

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
Hurry up.

10
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,760
We're running late!

11
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,060
Okay, I'll be right there!

12
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,160
Geez...

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,660
Come on, Mr. Mouri.

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,360
It's nothing to get heated up over.

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,860
Shut up!

16
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,460
Why do I, Kogoro Mouri,

17
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,560
have to serve as a driver for two sassy chicks?

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,860
Moreover, you're from the Suzuki Financial Group,

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,760
don't you even have your own chauffeur?

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,660
No way! I don't want a chauffeur driving me around on vacation.

21
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,060
I hate feeling like I'm being watched!

22
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,860
Is that so...

23
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,360
Yes, that's how it is.

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,960
Well, there's one kid who's got a cold,

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,160
so be careful you don't catch it.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,760
Conan has a cold?

27
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,560
Thank you for waiting!

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,260
I took time trying to get Conan ready.

29
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,460
Are you going to be all right, Conan?

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,060
You got a cold, don't you?

31
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,660
Yes, I'm fine, just fine.

32
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,760
I just got the sniffles!

33
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,760
Okay, so now that we're all set!

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,260
Off we go to Karuizawa!

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,960
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,160
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 1)"

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Are you okay, Conan?

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes, I'm fine.

39
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,260
If you start feeling bad,

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,660
tell me right away, okay?

41
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,060
Okay!

42
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,960
Gosh, if you have a cold,

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,460
why didn't you just stay home?

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,660
The owner of Poirot Cafe

45
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,260
offered to watch you one whole day today.

46
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,860
But I want to see Sonoko's villa in Karuizawa too!

47
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,760
Geez.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,060
And besides, knowing Sonoko for what she is,

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,960
she'll probably think up some bad ideas like always.

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Maybe we'll find a really good mate!

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,160
What? We're going boy-hunting playing tennis?

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
That's right!

53
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Just about this time, there are many university students

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,560
at the tennis courts near the villa.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,460
Gosh. If you do something like that,

56
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,060
Kyogoku's going to get mad at you!

57
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,960
What do you mean by that?

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,560
Of course, he's the only guy for me.

59
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,860
You're the one who's going to get someone today!

60
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,660
What?

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,160
You'll wear your tennis wear to show off your great body

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,960
to the university students.

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,460
You'll take a snapshot with him

64
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,560
and send it to him as a mail attachment!

65
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,660
You'll do all this to get Kudo, that boyfriend of yours, jealous!

66
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,760
How about it?

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,160
I don't think he'll get jealous.

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Just as I thought...

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,360
Besides, the only thing I have is a Teitan High School jersey uniform.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,060
I don't have tennis wear.

71
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,360
Don't you worry!

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
I bought tennis wear for you and brought it along.

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,860
Geez...

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,060
Look at this!

75
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,360
It's super mini and cute too!

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,660
Short!

77
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Hey! I could never wear something like that!

78
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,160
I didn't bring my safety pants with me either!

79
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,260
I see...

80
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,860
It can't be helped then.

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,060
I guess you'll just have to wear a regular panties then, Ran.

82
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,960
Regular panties?

83
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,160
Darn it! I'd love to see it.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,760
But I don't want others to see it.

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,360
Hey. I don't know what you two are blabbering about

86
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,060
but if my daughter is going to be humiliated

87
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
just for that detective brat,

88
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,460
I'm heading back home.

89
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,760
You can if you want too but...

90
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,560
There are going to be a lot of voluptuous girls there too.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,660
What?

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,660
University girls!

93
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,960
The weather was so nice in the morning, but now...

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
My voluptuous university girls...

95
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,060
We can't play tennis in this weather.

96
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,160
I don't know if I should be happy or sad about this.

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,860
Oh, well...

98
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,460
I thought I'll get to see Ran's panty glimpse with tennis shorts

99
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,760
that I haven't seen in a while today.

100
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,360
Too bad!

101
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Well, I guess I should be glad.

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,460
Somebody's on the tennis court.

103
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,860
Maybe they're my voluptuous girls...

104
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,160
Darn it. It's a guy.

105
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
May I help you with something?

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
What?

107
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
A handsome guy.

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Oh, no...

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,660
"Hiroto Akashi (32)" -I was just recalling memories

110
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,260
when I first met my wife here.

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,860
Geez. He's already taken...

112
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,660
If all of you came to play tennis,

113
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,360
would you like me to coach you on how to play better?

114
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,960
I'm a tennis instructor.

115
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,660
My house is near here too,

116
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,860
so if you'd like...

117
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,060
Thank you for your offer,

118
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,560
but I don't think so...

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,860
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
I see.

121
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,560
That's too bad.

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,760
So long.

123
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,460
So we couldn't fish any men after all.

124
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,160
Okay, let's go...

125
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,160
fish instead then!

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Hey... What's with this turn of events?

127
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Just watch!

128
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,260
I'll catch us some delicious fish for dinner!

129
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,260
The Chef and my older sister are already preparing dinner

130
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,960
and waiting for us there.

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
It seems like the river water is increasing.

132
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,660
Geez... It took my float and all again.

133
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,060
That's because you don't tie it well enough!

134
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
Fish lines are slippery

135
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,260
so unless you tie them like this...

136
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Hey, your fishing line is being pulled, Mr. Mouri!

137
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
What?

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,560
Hey, this is a big one!

139
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,660
My rental car?

140
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,160
-No way! -It's been carried into the river!

141
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Didn't I tell you that

142
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,160
you parked the car too close to the edge of the river.

143
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,860
Why you...

144
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Dad!

145
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
Darn it!

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,060
I'm not letting the river take the car!

147
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,160
You can't do anything about it already, Dad!

148
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,760
Hey, are you okay?

149
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,660
I'm fine, although my right wrist hurts a bit.

150
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,760
I wonder if you sprained it.

151
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,160
You probably landed on it when you fell into the river.

152
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,960
Well, it's way better than being stranded in the water.

153
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,360
This is no time for jokes!

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,860
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,660
But, what do we do now?

156
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,760
All our things have drifted away with the car.

157
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,960
Our cell phones aren't working because we're out of range.

158
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,660
And it's gotten dark after all this walking.

159
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,760
On top of that,

160
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,260
don't you two think that maybe we're lost?

161
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
-What? -What?

162
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,660
Hey, you mean you were walking around not knowing where you were?

163
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,160
Well, I was just kind of trusting my intuition.

164
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,860
Geez, what now?

165
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
There's light.

166
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,060
What?

167
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
See, over there.

168
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,860
You mean there are people living out in the mountains like this?

169
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,960
I'm sure it's a mountain witch!

170
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,360
Let's have her put us up for a while then.

171
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,660
-What? -What?

172
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,860
We got to get some dry clothes for this brat, don't we?

173
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,160
Excuse me.

174
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm sorry to be intruding on you at this hour,

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,560
but is anybody home?

176
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,860
He's coming out!

177
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,860
You guys are the ones who've come out.

178
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,160
"Iwao Akashi (65), Hiroto's Father"

179
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,260
So, you're solicitors of some kind again?

180
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
I won't be deceived even if you bring kids along with you!

181
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,560
No, we're...

182
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,160
Go home! Go home!

183
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,260
This is no place for swindlers like you to come!

184
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,160
Who is it, father?

185
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,560
You people are...

186
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
What a laugh!

187
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,460
You fell into the river trying to fish your car

188
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,960
that drifted into the river.

189
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,260
It's no laughing matter.

190
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,460
Sorry...

191
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,860
But he'll be fine!

192
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,260
With a little compress and by fixing his wrist in place,

193
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,160
if it's just a sprain, he'll recover in no time.

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,360
Turn this way and let me look into your mouth.

195
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,360
Your throat is red and your voice is hoarse,

196
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,060
so try not to use your voice too much.

197
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,660
You may come down with acute laryngitis.

198
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,860
Okay.

199
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,160
It's as if you're a doctor...

200
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Yeah, I learned a lot when I was coaching tennis players

201
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,460
to prepare them for competitions.

202
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,660
How do the clothes of when I was a child fit you?

203
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
They fit like a glove!

204
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,360
That's great then.

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,560
I smell curry?

206
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,060
Yes. It's left-over from last night, though.

207
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,360
If you don't mind, would you like some?

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Can I?

209
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,960
This is good!

210
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,860
It's as good as the kind you eat at a restaurant!

211
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,660
Really! It's delicious!

212
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,260
Since you have a sore throat,

213
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,860
you eat eggs over rice, okay, Conan?

214
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay...

215
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,360
I like the spiciness of this curry!

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,260
Your wife must be a good cook!

217
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,860
Oh, well...

218
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm the one who made this.

219
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,860
My wife passed away three years ago today.

220
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,560
I see...

221
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,760
That's why you were at the tennis court recalling memories of her.

222
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,460
Well, when I was trainer, I also made meals for the players

223
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,160
while taking their body condition into consideration too.

224
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,960
I was also better at cooking than my wife.

225
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,160
I'm going to take curry to father who is upstairs,

226
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,660
so please help yourself to seconds if you wish.

227
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,360
Oh, okay.

228
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,160
Dad, I brought you your meal.

229
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,360
Yeah.

230
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,460
Mr. Hiroto is sure taking his time.

231
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,760
It's already been 40 minutes since then.

232
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,960
This is really getting on my nerves.

233
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,160
What is?

234
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,360
This long cable hanging from the light above!

235
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,560
It's getting in the way of me trying to eat.

236
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,860
Stop complaining.

237
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,560
You already had two servings.

238
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,960
That cable is for dad.

239
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,860
He wanted an electric cable that he could reach because he's hunched over.

240
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,060
Oh, I see...

241
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,160
You sure took a long time,

242
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,560
when all you did was go to give him his curry.

243
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Yeah.

244
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
Dad started saying strange things

245
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,960
so we got to talking with each other.

246
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,360
He said he's not eating because he wants to die out of the blue.

247
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,860
-What? -Wants to die?

248
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,060
It seems that he thinks that he is being disliked by God

249
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,560
because he's lost his wife as well as his daughter-in-law.

250
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,960
Well, he seems to be okay now

251
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,460
since he's started eating curry, which is also his favorite dish.

252
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,160
So please don't worry about it.

253
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,960
What? The road is blocked because of a landslide

254
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,160
and you can't come to pick us up today?

255
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
Are you serious?

256
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,660
You can stay over here then.

257
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,460
We've got a lot of mattresses here too.

258
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,260
I'm sorry to trouble you, but thank you very much.

259
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,660
Oh, right.

260
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,160
Will you go get father's dish for me?

261
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes, sure!

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,860
But he's very jittery as well as a slow eater.

263
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,960
If the room light is on, it means he's still eating,

264
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,460
so come back without making a sound, okay?

265
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,660
Okay.

266
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,760
The light of the room is...

267
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,960
It's still on.

268
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,160
Quiet...

269
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
He's crying?

270
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,560
No, not like that.

271
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,060
Forehand goes like this.

272
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,160
Okay.

273
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,860
I'm sure he's already finished eating by now.

274
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,460
I'll go back up to get his dishes again.

275
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Thank you.

276
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,360
I'll go too.

277
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Quietly...

278
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,960
Okay, the lights are out.

279
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
What? He's not in bed.

280
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,640
Ran?

281
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
He's bleeding from his mouth?

282
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,440
Ran! What's the matter?

283
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,540
That is...

284
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,340
Father...

285
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,540
No way.

286
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,040
Hey, what's going on?

287
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,240
What...

288
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,340
He's still warm,

289
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,040
but his toes are starting to stiffen.

290
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,540
He's estimated to have been dead for about 30 minutes.

291
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,440
Excuse me, Mr. Hiroto.

292
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
Will you please call the police?

293
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,540
Sure.

294
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,740
I guess the officers of the Gunma prefecture will be coming.

295
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,440
Hey. If it's Gunma Prefecture...

296
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,540
No way.

297
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,240
"Gunma Prefecture"

298
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Summoned and here I am!

299
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,840
If it's for you, Mr. Mouri,

300
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,340
I'll go through fire and water.

301
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,040
The roads may be blocked because of the rain,

302
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,540
but I've come as fast as possible because you have called me!

303
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,640
I wonder if the Gunma police station has nobody else to dispatch?

304
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,240
And? What kind of murder case is it this time?

305
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,140
What's the murder weapon? Any evidence?

306
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,240
You're going to do it, right? The Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

307
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,540
Stop smiling all over the place at a place like this.

308
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,340
For God's sake, talk about lacking prudence.

309
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,640
Besides, we're not even sure if this is a homicide either yet.

310
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,140
There's the dead body.

311
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,840
Don't tell me that this is...

312
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,540
The one who passed away is the head of this house, Mr. Iwao Akashi.

313
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,840
The one who found him is

314
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,040
my daughter, Ran, who went to clear his dish.

315
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,540
When she found him,

316
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,240
the light of this room on the second floor was turned off.

317
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,540
But when she checked an hour and a half earlier the light was on,

318
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
so she thought he was still eating his curry

319
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,840
and didn't enter the room.

320
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,740
I checked right away after the incident

321
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,540
but the victim seems to have been dead for about 30 minutes.

322
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,440
There were four of us in the house then

323
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,840
but all of us were in the living room on the first floor

324
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,840
from two hours before the incident, so we all have an alibi.

325
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
Well, the only one who wasn't in the living room all the time was me

326
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,840
because I was taking a bath.

327
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,540
Which means that you're the only one

328
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,640
who could've committed the murder, Mr. Mouri!

329
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,240
I came to this house for the first time today!

330
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,940
I don't even know where the rope is,

331
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,440
so how could I have done it?

332
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,540
Oh, is that so?

333
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,040
It's a bit of a concern

334
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,740
that the victim is bleeding from his mouth

335
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
but as you can obviously see...

336
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,840
What?

337
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,340
Why is it of any concern?

338
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,640
I thought that people who die like this

339
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,840
always bleed from their mouths?

340
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Yes...

341
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,240
I've seen scenes like that in movies and dramas.

342
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,540
That's not true.

343
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,140
The doctor once told me that

344
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,340
when something is wrapped around your throat,

345
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,140
your face gets swollen because the blood circulation is stopped,

346
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,940
and unless you have a wound in your mouth or something,

347
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,140
you don't bleed from the mouth!

348
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,540
So I think in the movies or dramas,

349
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,740
they go out of their way to do so

350
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,440
to make it visually obvious that the person is dead.

351
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,240
No, don't talk.

352
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,540
You'll strain your throat because of your cold.

353
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,040
But, if it's just as the boy just said,

354
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,740
I wonder why he's bleeding from his mouth.

355
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,040
I think it's because he was going to the dentist

356
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,040
to get his teeth treated.

357
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
He told me that he was going to the dentist

358
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,540
because his tooth was hurting.

359
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,240
May I ask who you are?

360
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm Iwao Akashi's son, Hiroto.

361
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,940
Although I was adopted by him when I was a child.

362
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,640
His right molar's been pulled out.

363
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
It seems that after he died,

364
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,140
it bled from here

365
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,040
and blood came out when he drooled.

366
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,340
Mr. Hiroto, do you know when and which dentist that your father went to?

367
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,840
Well...

368
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,340
he left to go about two or three days ago.

369
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,740
Who cares about it at this point?

370
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,940
We already know that this is suicide.

371
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,140
What?

372
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,640
He probably used this ladder here.

373
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,640
He got on here and pulled the rope through the thick beam there.

374
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
No doubt this is suicide.

375
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
According to what Mr. Hiroto told us,

376
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,740
he said that his father was saying he wanted to die.

377
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,240
No way...

378
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,740
What am I going to do?

379
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,940
I told everybody back at the station

380
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,440
that I would video tape Sleeping Kogoro's deduction.

381
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,840
Gosh.

382
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,740
What am I going to tell everybody when I get back to the station?

383
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,940
Well, all is well.

384
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,640
Now that it's suicide, you don't have to

385
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,240
go through the trouble of investigating any further.

386
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Well, that's true, but...

387
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,340
Hey, don't think it's strange?

388
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,540
This old man is bent over

389
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,240
and only about 30cm taller than me and yet...

390
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,440
See! The electric cable for the light here

391
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,540
is made to fit the height of the old man and yet...

392
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,940
I can't reach it even if I stretch my arm out.

393
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,340
Now that you mentioned it.

394
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,940
Which means that this is not suicide but...

395
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,340
Well,

396
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,540
some time ago when father got up late at night,

397
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,340
the electric cable got in his eyes

398
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,540
and he didn't like it all.

399
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,340
So only the electric cable in my father's room is short.

400
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,940
I see...

401
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,840
So, it is suicide after all.

402
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,140
Yes...

403
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,140
We'll be waiting in the living room downstairs then,

404
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,440
so if you have any questions just holler.

405
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,940
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,540
For gotten all of you to be involved

407
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,640
in something like this on your vacation.

408
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,940
It's fine.

409
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,340
Do you go fishing too?

410
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,340
Because...

411
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,240
See. Fishing for Beginners.

412
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,940
That's a book my wife bought.

413
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,740
The one who passed away from an illness three years ago?

414
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,040
Yes.

415
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,140
But, I've never seen her gone fishing,

416
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,340
so maybe she was planning to do so after she recovered.

417
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,940
Something's strange.

418
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,540
There's something strange about him.

419
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,240
He let's Ran go all the way upstairs to get the dish,

420
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,140
the length of the electric cable of that room

421
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,240
and the thing about his father's teeth being treated are all fishy.

422
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,140
If he knew that his father had his teeth treated

423
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,540
two or three days ago,

424
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,640
why would he make something spicy like curry?

425
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,740
If he was making food for the players

426
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,940
when he was a trainer

427
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,740
because he was concerned about their health,

428
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,940
he should know of things like this.

429
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,040
As for that curry,

430
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,240
the amount that he made is way too much for just two of them.

431
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,140
He couldn't have known beforehand

432
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,540
that we would be coming here.

433
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,040
And besides...

434
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,940
There must be something

435
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,140
with the way the electric cable is tied.

436
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,040
There is definitely something behind this case.

437
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,000
"Electric cable"

439
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,920
I'll try and see something in the curry!

440
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,720
Clean cut potatoes from the garden but it doesn't make sense.

441
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,880
Out of nothing, he talks with a lot of spice.
