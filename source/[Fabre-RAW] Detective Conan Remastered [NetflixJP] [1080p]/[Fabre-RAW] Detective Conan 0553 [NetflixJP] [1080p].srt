Togashi! Don't just sit there, say something!

Togashi.

Today at 16:00...

00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:40,032
This man, Fumitaka Togashi was scheduled to be sent

7
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:42,932
to the prosecutor as a suspect of murder.

8
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:45,632

confronting the suspect in the interrogation room.

00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:00,632
He sees through the one and only truth.

-Okay, great! -It's my turn next.

Togashi!

21
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:15,275
Good work! Great how you hung in there!

22
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,675
Mr. Mouri!

23
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:22,175
Fumitaka Togashi is a murderer that Pops had arrested

24
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,775
when he was a police detective,

25
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,185
and today was the day that man came out of prison.

26
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,975
-Excuse me! -Throw it over this way, please.

27
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:34,475
Here!

28
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,575
-Thank you, sir! -Thank you!

29
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,975
Although it's not much, I've reserved a seat for you too.

30
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,775
Let's go and...

31
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,375
I'm sorry, if you will excuse me.

32
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,775
Huh?

33
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,275
Hey, Togashi!

34
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,175
Wait! Hakamada!

35
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,975
The incident occurred.

36
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,675
Last night at around 22:00,

37
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,675
Mr. Takehiko Sakuraba, age 55

38
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,259
who resides at 4-Beika-cho was murdered.

39
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,975
A convict, who was released on parole from the Musashino Prison yesterday,

40
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,575
who was under the supervision of parole officer, Mr. Sakuraba,

41
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:50,775
suspect Fumitaka Togashi, age 32 was arrested.

42
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:54,775
What? It can't be...

43
00:04:56,775 --> 00:05:01,075
"Beika Police Station. Today at 10:05 a.m."

44

"Officer Norio Kasamatsu (52), Beika Police Station 1st Division"

45
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:08,775
It's no use keeping quiet, Togashi!

46
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,875
Detective Mouri is outside, too.

47
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,075
What?

48
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:19,775
I see. So, you arrested Togashi in the past.

49
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:20,975
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:25,275
He killed a man in a fight over something trivial.

51
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,975
And although his lawyer pleaded self-defense,

52
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:30,309
his attitude in court was rebellious,

53
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,311
and it turned out he had a previous police record.

54
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,375
Therefore, he was sentenced to a term of 13 years.

55
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,175
Nevertheless, he is a kind guy inside,

56
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,275
who thinks a lot of his mother.

57
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,675
After serving his term, his character completely reformed

58
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,375
and he became a model prisoner.

59
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:47,275
How can it be that he would kill again?

60
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,975
Moreover, on the night of the day that he's released on parole.

61
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,575
It's unbelievable!

62
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:54,675
I understand how you must feel, but...

63
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,375
What a softie.

64
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,575
It just goes to show that people don't change that easily.

65
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:03,175
So, Inspector.

66
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:04,675
We'll be go through the procedure of sending him

67
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:06,675
to the prosecutor as scheduled.

68
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:11,275
Please wait a while.

69
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,075
You're Mr. Mouri I believe.

70
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,475
I've heard a lot about you.

71
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,075
Well, regardless of who you were in the past,

72
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,675
right now you're just a private eye.

73
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:22,361
Outsiders don't have a say in this!

74
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,675
Officer Kasamatsu, process it immediately.

75
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,275
Yes, sir!

76
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,375
Inspector!

77
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,675
Only, he's to be sent to the prosecutor as scheduled at 16:00.

78
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,975
We'll take a break till then.

79
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:41,975
But Togashi is to be kept here at the interrogation room!

80
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,075
That's ridiculous!

81
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,775
You've got to be joking!

82
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,075
I'll talk to your superior about this.

83
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,875
Thank you so much, Inspector!

84
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:01,075
Sleeping Kogoro. We owe you a lot, you see.

85
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:05,075
I repeat, break time is till 16:00!

86
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,575
Yes, sir!

87
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,675
So, that's how Pops got special permission

88
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:13,775
to interrogate Togashi, but...

89
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:17,275
Togashi, don't just sit there, say something!

90
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:18,775
Togashi!

91
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,175
Dad...

92
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:28,427
The victim's wounds are concentrated on the right side of his body.

93
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:32,431
No, Conan, you shouldn't look without permission.

94
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,175
Does that mean that the culprit was holding

95
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,575
the murder weapon in his left hand?

96
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:38,975
Yeah. We also have an eye-witness report on that, too.

97
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:42,441
But he's not a lefty.

98
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:47,175
No, but there are several wounds on the left side too.

99
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,175
He probably switched the hands he was holding the murder weapon with,

100
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,275
several times when he was struggling with the culprit.

101
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,453
It's true. That's a possibility.

102
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,075
To make sure if it was really so...

103
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,175
Where's the men's room?

104
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,975
I don't want you to get lost, so I'll wait here.

105
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,775
Thank you.

106
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,875
Hello?

107
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,675
Mr. Mouri? Huh?

108
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:17,075
What about the interrogation?

109
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,575
I'm on break for lunch.

110
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:23,075
The thing is, Takagi. I'd like you to do me a favor.

111
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:25,975
Huh? Yes, sir!

112
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:28,975
Huh? Go to the site right now?

113
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,675
Yes, yes, all right!

114
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,493
And about Ran...

115
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,475
Dad says for me to go home?

116
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,175
He said that you don't have to worry.

117
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:42,875
It seems that Conan's going home too.

118
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,475
See you then, because I've got to run!

119
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,875
Wait!

120
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,509
Gee, everybody's so selfish!

121
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:54,513
Conan?

122
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,875
Pops says he forgot to tell you some things,

123
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,517
so he wants me to go along with you.

124
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,519
Huh? You mean Mr. Mouri?

125
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,075
Hurry! There's not much time

126
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,975
before he'll be taken to the prosecutor, is there?

127
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
Do you remember, Togashi?

128
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:12,175
After serving time, you wrote me letters for 6 months.

129
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:14,533
You wrote that you are reflecting on yourself

130
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,475
and repenting what you had done.

131
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,175
That you're going to become a new person

132
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:22,541
and take care of your mother from now on.

133
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:27,675
Just as you said, you got back on your feet.

134
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:30,275
I never felt happier

135
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:32,551
about having been a police detective than that time.

136
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,575
Rather, your mother was the one who was most happiest.

137
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,275
How is she?

138
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:43,675
What's the matter, Togashi?

139
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,875
Oh boy.

140
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,075
Don't go touching things here and there now, Conan.

141
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,675
I won't.

142
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,675
Please reconsider the eye-witness testimony

143
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,875
from the standpoint of the murder site.

144
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,675
Just how do I do something like that?

145
00:09:57,675 --> 00:10:02,075
The culprit was witnessed from this window, right?

146
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,075
Huh?

147
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,775
Yeah, the eye-witness is, see over there...

148
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,275
that elderly woman.

149
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,575
Huh?

150
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,275
Why are there blood stains on two separated places,

151
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,275
one away from the other?

152
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,875
True, I wonder why?

153
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,775
These shiny things are shattered pieces of glass, right?

154
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:20,599
It's the mirror of the door of that closet.

155
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,603
Maybe it cracked when the victim and the culprit fought each other.

156
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,605
Was the murder weapon on the ground here?

157
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,075
-Yeah. -Any prints?

158
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,775
You mean on the murder weapon? None.

159
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,275
They were wiped off with something.

160
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,875
Not only were they wiped off from the murder weapon,

161
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,875
but also from the sliding door

162
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,619
and everything that the killer is thought to have touched.

163
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,375
Let me see it!

164
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,675
The prints of the victim aren't on it, either.

165
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,775
That's right. The kitchen, the bathroom,

166
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:51,075
the bedroom, also have no prints anywhere.

167
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:52,631
Everything's been completely wiped off.

168
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,675
I wonder why he went that far?

169
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:59,475
When and where was Mr. Togashi arrested?

170
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,375
Uh...

171
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,175
Last night at 22:30 in Beika Park.

172
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:09,075
What time was the murder witnessed?

173
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:12,675
10 minutes before that at around 22:20.

174
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,075
If you were to run from here to Beika Park,

175
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:17,675
it would take at least 7 or 8 minutes, right?

176
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,175
Which means?

177
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:21,375
It wouldn't have been possible for him to do all he did

178
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,075
in just a matter of a few minutes

179
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,175
after committing the crime!

180
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:28,375
He wiped the print off before committing the crime?

181
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,975
It can't be.

182
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:32,975
Then, he did it along with the crime.

183
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,975
Or, could there have been someone else?

184
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:38,475
Yeah, that's highly probable. But...

185
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:41,875
When he was arrested, Togashi was alone.

186
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,275
So, they fled separately?

187
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,675
Only a night has passed yet,

188
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,675
so maybe if we search for an eye-witness...

189
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:49,875
That's it!

190
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,675
"Beika Police Station"

191
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,575
Togashi.

192
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:56,695
Back then, when I arrested you,

193
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,975
you were outraged because a bunch of hoodlums

194
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,475
beat your friend up and was badly hurt,

195
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,975
and did what you did in a fury of anger, right?

196
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:10,275
Don't tell me that you're sticking up for somebody again?

197
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:14,713
You mean there was somebody else there?

198
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,175
Togashi, tell me the truth!

199
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,717
Please tell me the truth, Togashi!

200
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,739
Please stop it there!

201
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,741
-What? -This man.

202
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:45,275
What about him?

203
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:48,175
If I remember correctly, he...

204
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,775
So that's what it was!

205
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,275
What this?

206
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:02,475
About the thing that Pops forgot to tell you...

207
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:05,475
I forgot to ask you about it!

208
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:09,075
About reconsidering the eye-witness testimony,

209
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,769
he said to do it from both the murder site

210
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,771
as well as from the place it was witnessed from.

211
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,675
Granny, you saw the culprit from this window

212
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,775
through the window of the house over there, right?

213
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,675
"Kane Yoshizawa (75), eye-witness" -Yes. It was really frightening.

214
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,783
Thunder was roaring and there was a black-out.

215
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:27,675
I casually happened to look out the window and...

216
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:33,075
I couldn't make out his face,

217
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,875
but I had a feeling that our eyes met.

218
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,475
Then, suddenly...

219
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,375
Why'd he throw the murder weapon towards the window?

220
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,075
-No, but the murder weapon... -Huh?

221
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,275
Right.

222
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,275
The murder weapon was found not on the side of the window,

223
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:58,075
but in front of the closet.

224
00:13:58,075 --> 00:13:59,575
Maybe you saw wrong.

225
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,575
I've got good vision, you know.

226
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,823
My eyesight hasn't changed since I was in my 30's.

227
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,375
And, what happened after that?

228
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,175
I didn't see anything after that,

229
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,875
although lightning struck many times later too.

230
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,775
I see!

231
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:20,175
But if this is the truth, we're making a terrible mistake.

232
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,775
Pops!

233
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:29,713
Don't tell me, Inspector, that?

234
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,513
Too bad, Mr. Mouri.

235
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:34,853
It's almost time.

236
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,413
Wait!

237
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,113
There's still a little more time left.

238
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:40,613
Answer me, Togashi. Did you really...

239
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,861
You sure are persistent!

240
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,863
Mr. Mouri, time's up.

241
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,867
Togashi.

242
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:56,513
-Henyo. -Are you all right, Pops?

243
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,877
Come on, sit nicely!

244
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:02,213
And Officer Takagi wanted to tell you this.

245
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:04,013
It's about...

246
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:08,113
I'm sorry to have intruded on you!

247
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:11,713
What the heck is going on, letting out a strange cry?

248
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,913
If it's as usual, after this...

249
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,713
Please wait.

250
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,013
There is more behind this case!

251
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:20,913
Yes, yes! This is what happens!

252
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:25,513
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

253
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:28,413
I shall solve the case and show you the whole truth by 16:00,

254
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:31,313
the time he is to be taken to the prosecutor!

255
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,213
Okay, I'll let you handle it.

256
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,313
No, but...

257
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:39,213
It's as scheduled so there should be no problem.

258
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:42,213
So, just what is behind this case?

259
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:44,313
That there may in fact have been

260
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:49,613
another person at the site of the murder.

261
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,513
What?

262
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:52,931
That can't be?

263
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:56,935
Officer Takagi is checking the identity of this man right now.

264
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,513
Don't tell me that you're saying that man is the culprit?

265
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:00,939
It's ridiculous.

266
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,813
We've got an eye-witness testifying that she saw him!

267
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:06,945
She didn't see his face.

268
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,947
That's true.

269
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:12,313
Then, how would you explain the blood that was found on him?

270
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,113
Forensics already got results that

271
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,213
the blood matched that of the victim!

272
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,713
Too bad, he's got a motive.

273
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:24,963
Motive?

274
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:28,613
It seems that the victim was what you call an evil parole supervisor.

275
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,713
He seems to have gone around skilfully,

276
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,413
so that he wouldn't be reported to the police

277
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,613
and was squeezing money out of the criminal's family

278
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:37,613
by picking on their weakness.

279
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,013
Two years ago, your mother suffered

280
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,813
because of this and died ill, didn't she?

281
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,313
So, after all, he did...

282
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:50,989
No, if that's the motive, the other man fits right in too!

283
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,413
His wife and child have committed

284
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,993
after suffering the same ordeal!

285
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,213
The man in view on the surveillance camera of the convenience store,

286
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:00,999
Tsuneo Hakamada, age 34.

287
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,713
He was released on parole yesterday together with Togashi.

288
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:07,613
Moreover, Hakamada is left-handed.

289
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:11,009
That explains why most of the wounds on the victim

290
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,413
was concentrated on the right side.

291
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,613
The eye-witness also said that

292
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,413
the killer was holding the murder weapon in his left hand!

293
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,713
Check where the man called Tsuneo Hakamada who was released on parole

294
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:23,913
from Musashino Prison yesterday is!

295
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:25,023
Yes, sir!

296
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:26,313
Wrong!

297
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,813
Hakamada has nothing to do with this!

298
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:31,613
It's me! I did it!

299
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,035
What?

300
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:40,013
Hakamada confessed to the crime?

301
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,613
What?

302
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,043
Hakamada.

303
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,045
Why...

304
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,047
It's okay, Togashi.

305
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,413
I was planning to turn myself

306
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,613
after visiting the grave of my wife and child to begin with.

307
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,053
So, there's no mistake about

308
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:56,613
you being the one who committed the crime?

309
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:58,013
Yeah.

310
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:01,313
I got close to him inside prison

311
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:05,063
and he found out about my plan to kill Sakuraba.

312
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,513
I brushed Togashi who tried to stop me away,

313
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:10,613
and somehow committed the murder.

314
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:12,613
Then, Togashi who arrived at the scene of the murder,

315
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,113
although surprised, told me to leave

316
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:20,213
getting rid of the prints and all to him, and to flee.

317
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:23,081
When I realized later, I had fled from the scene.

318
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,085
Moreover, he ends up being arrested in my place.

319
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,087
Talk about stupid.

320
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,613
In other words, after he told Hakamada to flee,

321
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:38,113
he didn't know where Hakamada had touched,

322
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:41,813
so he decided to wipe all the prints off everything,

323
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,101
including the things that the victim had touched.

324
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,103
No doubt about it.

325
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,105
Just as would be expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

326
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,413
Thanks to you, we were spared arresting an innocent man!

327
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,713
I wonder about that.

328
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,113
Officer Takagi.

329
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:58,413
What time was Hakamada seen on the surveillance camera?

330
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:03,113
Uh, it was yesterday at 10:20.

331
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,913
What? That's...

332
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,813
Yes, that was the time...

333
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:12,813
Mrs. Kane Yoshizawa witnessed the murder.

334
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,513
Just what does that mean?

335
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:18,313
Hakamada would've had to be in two places at the same time.

336
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:20,713
But that's not possible, so...

337
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:23,513
Since Hakamada had blood on his clothes,

338
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:26,413
there's no doubt that he was once at the murder site.

339
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:31,149
But, after that, when he was witnessed from the house next door,

340
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,713
he was no longer at the site.

341
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,153
Officer Takagi.

342
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:38,213
What did the eye-witness say? About the murder weapon?

343
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:40,913
About the murder weapon?

344
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,713
I couldn't make out his face,

345
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:44,613
but I had a feeling that our eyes met.

346
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,513
Then, suddenly...

347
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,613
He threw the murder weapon at the eye-witness?

348
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,113
Yes, but it's strange.

349
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:57,175
The murder weapon wasn't found by the window,

350
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,313
but rather among the shattered pieces of glass

351
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,413
from the cracked mirror in front of the closet.

352
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:04,313
In other words, the killer didn't throw the weapon at Kane,

353
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:06,613
but rather, at the mirror.

354
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:07,613
What?

355
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:10,613
So, the eye-witness saw the figure of the culprit

356
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,813
that was reflected in the mirror?

357
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,193
Exactly! In other words,

358
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,213
the murder weapon that was held in the killer's left hand

359
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,613
was actually held in his right hand.

360
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,013
What?

361
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,713
And on the other hand,

362
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:28,513
the killer was surprised at the witness who was reflected in the mirror

363
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:30,413
and inadvertently threw the murder weapon at her,

364
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:32,613
cracking the mirror.

365
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:33,713
In other words,

366
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:36,813
the culprit who was witnessed at this time was right handed,

367
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:40,913
and the culprit who fled earlier was left handed.

368
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:41,913
Hold it.

369
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:45,013
Does that mean that the victim was killed twice?

370
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:47,813
There is only one thinkable answer.

371
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,213
The victim once thought to be dead, came to again

372
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,813
and was actually killed by the other person who was there!

373
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:58,013
What?

374
00:20:58,013 --> 00:21:02,913
That culprit was indeed you, Togashi!

375
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:08,313
I just couldn't forgive that guy

376
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:13,251
for the suffering he put our families through.

377
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,813
I just couldn't forgive him!

378
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:24,413
The long day in the interrogation room is over.

379
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:49,713
I wish you told me the truth when I sat together with you

380
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:53,351
in the interrogation room yesterday, Togashi.

381
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:59,013
Well, I guess you couldn't tell a no good detective that didn't even know

382
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:01,613
that your mother had passed away, though.

383
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:07,365
I was afraid to tell the truth, so I just couldn't.

384
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,713
But thanks to you,

385
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:12,413
I was able to not make a scapegoat out of Hakamada.

386
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:13,913
Thank you very much!

387
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:17,013
What? Me again?

388
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,113
My memory in that area is not...

389
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,113
Well, I guess, that's the story!

390
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,913
Ran, contact Eri, will you?

391
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:33,391
Call mother?

392
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:34,813
Don't tell me that...

393
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,395
It's nothing like that.

394
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,413
You're going to ask her to act as Mr. Togashi's attorney, right?

395
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,113
I know.

396
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:45,113
But, while we're at it anyway, why not go eat with her or something?

397
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,405
If she insists we do, I guess why not while we're at it,

398
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,407
because it's not such a bad idea.

399
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:50,613
Hey, hey.

400
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:52,513
Using too many phrases like "if she insists" or "while we're at it"

401
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:54,413
may get you in trouble.

402
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,013
Talk about scary!

403
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,423
"Letter"

405
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,425
The stage for the next episode is Kinosaki Spa in Hyogo prefecture.

406
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:09,124
I guess I'll go take a dip in the spa, too.

407
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:10,640
-You have to stay back here, Inspector. -What?
