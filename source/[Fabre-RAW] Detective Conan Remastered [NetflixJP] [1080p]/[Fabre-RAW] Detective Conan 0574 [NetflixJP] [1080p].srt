1
00:00:02,614 --> 00:00:05,414
Heiji and Kazuha came to Tokyo

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:07,514
to get back Kazuha's lucky charm

3
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:10,814
that Heiji hand mistakenly given away.

4
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:14,014
The person that the charm was given to was Mr. Teruaki Kunimatsu

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,814
who had broken his left arm during tennis practice

6
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:19,999
and was staying over at his friend's place.

7
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:25,114
Mr. Kunimatsu was found

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:26,005
"Teruaki Kunimatsu (20)" -assaulted and battered by someone

9
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:28,814
"Teitan University second-year student" -in the restroom of a sports cafe.

10
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:32,314
Heiji and I who started investigation along with Officer Takagi,

11
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:35,414
narrowed the suspects down to three people.

12
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,514
Moreover,

13
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:39,514
we found that the sports match that Mr. Kunimatsu watched in the afternoon

14
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:42,614
seemed to have something to do with the incident.

15
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:46,025
However, we didn't know which match he watched.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,014
All three of the suspects

17
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,514
watched a sports match in the afternoon.

18
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:53,314
I'm sure that a clue that leads to the culprit

19
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,035
can be found in the testimony of the three suspects!

20
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:02,414
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

21
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:04,414
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

22
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:05,514
The mystery of the case is finally solved.

23
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:08,714
What on earth was inside Kazuha's lucky charm?

24
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,414
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,414
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,414
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,921
"The Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 2)".

28
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:07,021
I guess all three did go to watch an exciting game,

29
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:12,171
but unless we figure out what game Mr. Kunimatsu went to watch today...

30
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,173
Yeah.

31
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:16,821
Didn't you find anything in his wallet?

32
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,521
Like the cut off half of a ticket for a game or something.

33
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:21,721
No. Besides a some money and credit cards,

34
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,121
just a lucky charm.

35
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,221
Coming up is pro baseball news!

36
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:29,021
Here are the highlights from the day game.

37
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,121
Maybe he went to a baseball match?

38
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,193
You see, maybe he actually went to watch a baseball game

39
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,921
but lied about it?

40
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,221
I see!

41
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,197
If something happened between

42
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:41,921
the culprit and Mr. Kunimatsu that caused the problem,

43
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,921
he would never say that he went to watch a baseball game!

44
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:50,209
But the day game for baseball was just this game,

45
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,211
a plain game with a lot of errors.

46
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,621
The only thing good about it was that

47
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,821
at the bottom half of the 9th inning...

48
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,621
Hold it!

49
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,221
Well, since the customers left,

50
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,421
I decided to clean the table.

51
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,421
I wish you wouldn't clean up without asking first!

52
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:08,221
"Takuya Kyuma (26)" -It's still got popcorn inside.

53
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:11,221
"Kengo Haruto (44)" -Then, will you bring my half eaten hot dog

54
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:14,221
back to me after heating it up again!

55
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,721
"Kazuo Satsuma (51)" -Then, the same with my beer.

56
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,721
All right.

57
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:21,021
So, what was I talking about?

58
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,221
The day game! The day game!

59
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,721
Why would it be a day game if it were baseball?

60
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,921
If around here,

61
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,221
they had a night game at Yokohama too, didn't they?

62
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,721
Idiot!

63
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,251
When Mr. Kunimatsu made a phone call saying, "This is just great!

64
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:36,255
Luck has come my way at last! I'll show you proof from now".

65
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:38,257
It was sundown, you know!

66
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:42,021
So, it had to be a game that was held in the day time, right?

67
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,321
I guess so.

68
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:46,265
Besides, when I checked using my cell phone a while ago,

69
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:49,421
the score for this game was 1 to 5.

70
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,271
A player for the team that was making errors and losing

71
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:56,275
finally struck just one homerun at the bottom half of the 9th inning.

72
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,821
He would never say something like "This is just great!"

73
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,721
watching a shabby game like this, would he?

74
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,021
At any rate,

75
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,121
the games that were played in the day time

76
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,421
were sumo wrestling, beach volleyball, soccer,

77
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:11,921
the baseball game and golf.

78
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:14,293
Then, maybe it was golf?

79
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,621
If I remember correctly,

80
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,821
it seems to have been a very exciting game

81
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:20,621
where the game took a complete turn at the final hole.

82
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,303
But that course is a bit far from here, you see.

83
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:25,421
If after watching that match,

84
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:28,307
if you were to try to make it to this sports cafe by 20:00,

85
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
it would be pretty difficult.

86
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,311
According to the employee,

87
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,313
Mr. Kunimatsu seems to have come to the shop

88
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,521
about an hour before the incident occurred, so...

89
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:40,319
There's no clue.

90
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,521
There's no way of knowing who beat Mr. Kunimatsu up.

91
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,821
-Wrong. -Wrong.

92
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:48,021
-We already know who the culprit is! -We already know who the culprit is!

93
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:50,329
-No way. -Are you serious?

94
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,721
If you know who it is,

95
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,821
why don't you hurry and tell everybody about it,

96
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,335
and solve the case?

97
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,621
If you find that the lucky charm has nothing to do with the case,

98
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:01,121
you'll give it right back, won't you?

99
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:02,921
Yeah...

100
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:06,345
What's with you, all hung up on a lucky charm all the while?

101
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,721
Mr. Kunimatsu was beaten up

102
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,521
despite having the lucky charm on him, you know?

103
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,521
It's not all that effective!

104
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:15,421
That's a lucky charm that's effective only for me!

105
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,521
So, who's the culprit?

106
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:20,021
You know who it is, don't you?

107
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,721
But we don't have proof yet.

108
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,363
You don't have any?

109
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,221
-Right? -Yeah.

110
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,121
Talking about proof,

111
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:34,021
I wonder what it was that Kunimatsu was saying he was going to show me.

112
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,021
Yes, I wonder.

113
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,221
The first thing that comes to mind

114
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:41,521
as evidence of a great match is

115
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:45,621
a picture taken by cell phone when a put on a good play.

116
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:49,221
But no such pictures were found in his cell phone.

117
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:52,391
Maybe he got the autograph of a player

118
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,393
that performed really well in the match.

119
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,121
Although Kunimatsu liked sports,

120
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,421
the only time he'd get carried away asking for an autograph

121
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:04,403
is from a tennis player, because he himself plays tennis too.

122
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:09,121
Golfer Sho Mikawa shoots a Chip in Eagle at the final 18th hole

123
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:12,021
turning the game over, and winning the match!

124
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,921
I see, so that's the story.

125
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:22,721
That's why Mr. Kunimatsu called his friend over to this sports cafe.

126
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:26,425
In order to show him the conclusive evidence.

127
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,921
He didn't imagine that the person...

128
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:32,221
Would be taking a picture of it on the cell phone.

129
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:39,821
Is there still something else?

130
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:42,921
I would like to start heading on home.

131
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,621
It's already past 22:00.

132
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,447
We already told you everything that we know too.

133
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,721
You did a body check a while ago too,

134
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,453
but nothing came out, right?

135
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:58,457
But the only customers with no alibi are you three, you see...

136
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,221
Hey, hey! You don't have proof

137
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,321
and yet you still intend to keep us here?

138
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:05,421
If you want to go home that badly,

139
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,521
just go.

140
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,621
Of course,

141
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,921
I'm talking about the two who aren't the culprit, though.

142
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,921
Then, does it mean you found the evidence?

143
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:21,721
Yeah. We've got the culprit as well as the proof.

144
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,021
Really? Conan!

145
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:26,485
Yes, it seems so,

146
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,121
rather, why are you asking me?

147
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,921
If anybody, you should be asking Heiji, right?

148
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:36,495
Well, you mentioned a while ago that you knew who the culprit is too,

149
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,921
so I had a feeling that you might also

150
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:43,321
know what the evidence is.

151
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,821
But I wonder, why I thought so?

152
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:49,721
Of course, I'd know!

153
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,221
Because the culprit

154
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:57,021
said something strange that even a kid like me saw through.

155
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:58,921
Something a child would even know...

156
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,519
Something strange?

157
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:06,321
The comments on the games the three said they watched today.

158
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:09,421
There was one person that said something strange, wasn't there?

159
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,521
Well, if I remember correctly...

160
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:16,021
Mr. Kazuo Satsumo watched Sumo wrestling and...

161
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,537
Well, it was a good match

162
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,421
but I'm a fan of Akashoryu, who lost,

163
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,021
so I was vexed.

164
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,921
Mr. Kengo Haruto watched beach volleyball.

165
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,547
It was a succession of close games

166
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,321
and sure was a lot of fun!

167
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,921
Well, I did have my expectations of wardrobe malfunction too!

168
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:37,521
Mr. Takuya Kyuma watched soccer.

169
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:41,121
I'm a fan of the visitor team Big Osaka,

170
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:44,563
I clapped inconspicuously cheering the teammates of Big Osaka

171
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:48,567
who were hugging each other on the grounds after winning the game.

172
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,571
I can't really think of something that's strange.

173
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,621
Isn't it the wardrobe malfunction of the guy who watched beach volleyball?

174
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,921
It's strange when a person goes to watch sports

175
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,721
and anticipates swimsuits falling out of place!

176
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,821
To put it frankly, that's sexual harassment!

177
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,583
It's just a joke!

178
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:09,321
Yeah, it's just that this man's lewd.

179
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,921
He hasn't said anything strange.

180
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,221
Well, unlike the underpants of sumo wrestling,

181
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:16,595
swimsuits falling out of place

182
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:19,621
does not seem to be considered a violation, so...

183
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,601
So, you mean that the person

184
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,603
who went to watch sumo wrestling is the culprit?

185
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:28,221
No, I didn't say anything about sumo underpants.

186
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,609
Goal!

187
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,621
Higo of Big Osaka,

188
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,421
despite the pressure of being the away team,

189
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:35,621
made a perfect goal shot!

190
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,221
Away?

191
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,617
Hold it.

192
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,921
In soccer, when a team plays on the grounds of its opponent team,

193
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,821
they aren't called visitor but rather, the away team.

194
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:44,921
Right, right.

195
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,521
The fans are called supporters

196
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,621
and the grounds are called pitch, right?

197
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:52,421
Which means...

198
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:53,421
Right.

199
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:55,521
He didn't use any of the words

200
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,821
that people who love soccer would use

201
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,641
and yet he said that he liked soccer and went to watch the match.

202
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,321
He had to lie and say so to the police.

203
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:09,921
Mr. Kyuna...

204
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:13,621
Is the only one who could be the culprit!

205
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:23,191
Wrong!

206
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:26,391
I just recently became a soccer fan!

207
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,667
So I'm still not used to...

208
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,091
If you saw the game,

209
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,391
give me the number that was on the back of the uniform that Higo,

210
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,091
the one who made goal was wearing.

211
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:37,391
Well...

212
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:39,491
You wouldn't know

213
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,891
because checking the result of the game on the cell phone

214
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:45,591
will tell you who scored at what time, but...

215
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:48,991
the number on the back of the top of uniform is not announced.

216
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:53,291
Well, player Higo is a representative player of Big Osaka,

217
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,591
so almost all the supporters are wearing his uniform.

218
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,491
If you went to watch the match,

219
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:02,701
you'd remember the number even if you didn't want to.

220
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,991
Like I said,

221
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,705
I went for the first time today to watch a soccer match.

222
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,891
You're a baseball fan, aren't you?

223
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:12,291
The terms visitor, fan and ground

224
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,713
are all used when referring to baseball.

225
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:18,291
Weren't you actually watching a baseball game?

226
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:21,591
Why baseball?

227
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,891
Didn't you just say that

228
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:27,991
if Mr. Kunimatsu excitedly called his friend,

229
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:31,391
he would've had to have watched a super entertaining game.

230
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:34,191
If the crime was not planned,

231
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:36,735
and the culprit held a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu

232
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,491
when they came into contact with each other...

233
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,391
It would most likely be the place

234
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:44,291
where the game that Mr. Kunimatsu got all excited about was held.

235
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291
If so,

236
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,091
the culprit would have had to be at the same match too.

237
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:54,491
The score that Mr. Kunimatsu could see was 1 to 6.

238
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,291
And the team that kept on making errors

239
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,191
finally struck a homerun at the end,

240
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,891
scoring one more point, right?

241
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,191
That's far from being a great game!

242
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,763
True.

243
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:05,991
In any sports,

244
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:09,191
any game that is full of errors doesn't make any one feel good,

245
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,769
whether you're on the winning side or not.

246
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,891
Moreover, if the score of the game is 1-10...

247
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,091
No matter how you look at it,

248
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:18,777
it couldn't have been called a great game.

249
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,779
But, what if you're the only one

250
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,591
who got a souvenir from that game?

251
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,191
Souvenir?

252
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:27,291
Moreover,

253
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,191
if it was something that was used in the game,

254
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:33,891
and also evidence of the great performance of the player,

255
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,391
wouldn't you be super happy?

256
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:39,991
No matter if you're not a fan of that player...

257
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:42,191
Don't tell me that it was...

258
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,091
the homerun ball?

259
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,591
If so, the people in the stands have a chance to get it too!

260
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:50,491
Then, Mr. Kunimatsu caught that homerun ball!

261
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:52,811
Right! He caught it

262
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,991
and wanted to boast about to his friend over here.

263
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,391
But, it was taken away from him by Mr. Kyuma

264
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:01,291
who followed him here from the baseball ground.

265
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,191
But, how did he know

266
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:07,491
that Mr. Kunimatsu caught the homerun ball?

267
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:08,591
That's because of...

268
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,391
Mr. Kunimatsu's pocket!

269
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,891
The back pocket of Mr. Kunimatsu's pants

270
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:16,191
were filled with his wallet, cell phone and cigarettes.

271
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,837
It was bulging to the max

272
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:23,391
because the culprit shoved all of Mr. Kunimatsu's things inside.

273
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:26,845
He did this to camouflage Mr. Kunimatsu's pocket

274
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,847
that was stretched out of shape.

275
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,091
I see!

276
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:33,191
Mr. Kunimatsu had shoved the ball

277
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,855
into the pocket of his slacks.

278
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,191
If even after the ball is removed,

279
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,591
if the pocket is stretched out of shape,

280
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:43,491
it'll be obvious that something was inside, right?

281
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:45,491
I'm sure that he was afraid

282
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:48,291
that people would realize that a baseball was inside

283
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,591
from the shape of how it was stretched out.

284
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:54,873
But, I wonder why Mr. Kunimatsu called his friend out here?

285
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:56,291
Right.

286
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,877
If he caught the homerun ball,

287
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,991
all he had to do was take it home and show it to him.

288
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:06,885
It seems that Mr. Kunimatsu was staying over at his friend's besides.

289
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:07,991
So,

290
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,491
if I told you that the baseball that I'm holding

291
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:14,893
is the winning ball that was used in the WBC game that Japan won,

292
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,895
would you believe me?

293
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,191
Of course, not!

294
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,691
Most naturally.

295
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:26,491
But, if there's an image that will prove that then, what?

296
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:27,691
An image?

297
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:28,907
Come to think of it,

298
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:32,911
you can watch homerun balls make it into the stands on TV, right?

299
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:33,791
Right.

300
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,391
In all other sports,

301
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:37,191
customers who are taken by TV cameras

302
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,917
are probably shot coincidentally,

303
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,091
but if somebody catches a homerun ball,

304
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:42,691
it is definitely aired on TV.

305
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,791
If a man wearing a cast on his arm,

306
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,391
obviously jumps up for joy,

307
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,391
they could've zoomed his face up.

308
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:51,591
That's why Mr. Kunimatsu told his friend to come here.

309
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:54,291
Now for today's homerun.

310
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,591
So that he could show his friend

311
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:57,791
as well as the other customers in the shop

312
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,291
the sports news that is aired

313
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,943
and then show them the homerun ball that he caught.

314
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,891
Really! Mr. Kunimatsu caught the ball!

315
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,591
Isn't the man sitting diagonally behind Mr. Kunimatsu...

316
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,391
Mr. Kyuma?

317
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:17,591
Yeah!

318
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,291
I see.

319
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,491
That's why just a while ago when the news

320
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,965
for this professional baseball game came on,

321
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
you shouted, right?

322
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,691
Because you wanted to divert our attention from the scene.

323
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,391
That's not all, is it?

324
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,975
It's also because the employee

325
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,891
was about to take this away, right?

326
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,491
The homerun ball that you stole from Mr. Kunimatsu

327
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:49,791
and buried into this barrel of popcorn.

328
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,991
But, why did you steal it?

329
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,991
Were you a fan of the player who hit that ball?

330
00:16:55,991 --> 00:17:00,391
Yeah, I really into him.

331
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:03,001
I'm referring to my girlfriend

332
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,003
who died of an illness last night.

333
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,591
She used to always talk about

334
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:12,091
catching the homerun ball that was thrown by him.

335
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:15,291
She kept mumbling, so until right before she passed away...

336
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:19,391
That's why I planned to catch the ball

337
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:23,480
and put it in her coffin before she is cremated.

338
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,025
So, I sat at outfield with a glove.

339
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:30,791
Then, it really came flying and I caught the ball!

340
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:33,291
You caught the ball?

341
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,491
But Mr. Kunimatsu was the one who caught it!

342
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,491
I really caught it!

343
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,791
But right afterwards,

344
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,691
I was squashed by the people around me

345
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,591
and when I snapped back to myself,

346
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:46,091
the ball was at the feet of the man with a cast on his arm,

347
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:48,091
and he got hold of it.

348
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:51,591
But there's nothing you can do about it.

349
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:54,191
Is that why you held a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu,

350
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:56,691
hit him and stole the ball?

351
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:59,057
No, I told him my situation

352
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:03,991
and asked him to give it to me repeatedly.

353
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,191
But he...

354
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:09,067
What? You again?

355
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,069
Lay off!

356
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,071
Please!

357
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,691
Please give me that homerun ball!

358
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:19,891
I don't know if you want to give to your girlfriend or what.

359
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,091
Why should I give you this ball, stupid?

360
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:26,491
I blew my top at hearing his remark

361
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:30,491
and thought that I had no choice but to take it from him.

362
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:35,391
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:41,091
Please tell the one you beat up those words.

364
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:44,691
We just got word from the hospital

365
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,691
that Mr. Kunimatsu regained consciousness.

366
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,991
-Really? -I'm glad!

367
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,791
"Haido Central Hospital"

368
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,491
For his girlfriend who died of an illness?

369
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:02,591
So, that's why he was pleading with all his might

370
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:06,291
for me to give him the ball?

371
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,091
You didn't know?

372
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:11,391
He said he explained his situation to you though.

373
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,491
I got annoyed at his words when he said he was going to

374
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:15,133
give it to his girlfriend as a gift.

375
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,291
I seemed to have skipped the part

376
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,137
where he mentioned that she died of an illness.

377
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,791
How come?

378
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,691
Because I just happened to be brushed off

379
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,891
by a girl that I really liked!

380
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:36,291
And about the lucky charm that was mistakenly given to you...

381
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,157
I got it back from the forensic officer

382
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,591
and handed it over to Heiji.

383
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:44,691
What? When and where?

384
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:47,991
A while ago in the corridor of this hospital.

385
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:51,169
-Idiot! -Idiot?

386
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,791
Hey, could it be that

387
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,891
the girl who brushed you off is...

388
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,891
Kazuha, Mr. Kunimatsu?

389
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,491
No, it can't be.

390
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,691
Because he went all the way back to Osaka

391
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,191
just so that he could have Kazuha make him a lucky charm

392
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,189
in order for him to win the tennis tournament

393
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,191
and yet after coming back to Tokyo,

394
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,193
he got hurt during practice.

395
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,291
That goes to show that you lost the will to play.

396
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,491
You looked inside lucky charm, didn't you?

397
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:24,191
Yeah,

398
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,791
the picture of that tanned boy.

399
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,891
Did you know about the picture, Conan?

400
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:31,991
Yeah.

401
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,591
I heard you and Kazuha talking.

402
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:37,215
I opened it thinking

403
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:40,691
that the cloth of the lucky charm was pretty worn out

404
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:43,221
for it to be brand new,

405
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:48,391
but that boy said that it was on the handle of Kazuha's bag, so...

406
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:53,891
Just thinking that this was Kazuha's lucky charm made me cry.

407
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,691
I was thinking of telling her how I feel about her

408
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:58,491
if I won the tennis tournament, but...

409
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,391
After catching that homerun ball,

410
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:07,245
I thought that luck was starting to turn my way,

411
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,791
but I guess it was just my imagination.

412
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,991
Where is that ball right now?

413
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:16,791
The forensic officers have it for now.

414
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:21,259
Then, can you give it to the guy who struck me later?

415
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,791
And tell him that I'm sorry I was mean to him.

416
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,263
Yeah.

417
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,591
That's right!

418
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:28,391
Please tell Kazuha too.

419
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,591
What... what do you want me tell her?

420
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,091
That I'm sorry I was mean to her.

421
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:40,191
Mean?

422
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,891
Please. No matter what you do, don't look inside, okay?

423
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,091
Heiji!

424
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:11,391
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

425
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,691
Shoots! He's opening the lucky charm after all!

426
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,791
Kazuha.

427
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:21,991
Now I know why you've been going around desperately

428
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,691
looking for the lucky charm.

429
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:36,191
You were so much into...

430
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:39,991
despising me to no return like this!

431
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:43,791
What?

432
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,391
What is this?

433
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,407
Well, I'm mature and adult enough

434
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:53,191
that I won't get angry at something like this.

435
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,091
I see.

436
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:58,791
He was so vexed that he scribbled all over the picture.

437
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,876
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,220
"Cup".

439
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,000
In the next episode, I'll be challenging myself to wearing costumes!

440
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,180
Just what kind of costume are planning to wear?

441
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,780
A pitch black look.
