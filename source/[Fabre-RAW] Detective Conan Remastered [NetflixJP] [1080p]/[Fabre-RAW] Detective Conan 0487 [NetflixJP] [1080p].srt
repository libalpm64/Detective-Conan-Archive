"Police Department"

2
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,160
But was that really true,

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,560
what you said before?

4
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,660
"First Investigation Division"

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,060
That's definitely what he said.

6
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,460
Maybe he's mistaken.

7
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,570
In that case...

8
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,840
She's here.

9
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,550
The three suspects Suwa, Yoshioka, Asai...

10
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,350
There's a possibility that there're other accomplices?

11
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,360
What?

12
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Is anything on my face?

13
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,840
What is it?

14
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,850
Excuse me.

15
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,850
It's nothing.

16
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,850
What on earth?

17
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,450
What're you all doing looking at me

18
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,550
and whispering away?

19
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,860
No, it's nothing.

20
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,260
Right?

21
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,460
Yes.

22
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,160
No, it's nothing.

23
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,640
No. It's nothing. Right?

24
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,240
Don't worry about it.

25
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,640
Really?

26
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,150
Yes.

27
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,760
Questioning of the victims of the Haidocho case is done.

28
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,860
Yes...

29
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,260
As to that case...

30
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,270
Give me a break.

31
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm amazing, don't you agree?

32
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,240
Really.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,740
I mean, talk about spitting it out!

34
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,850
It was like a scene from a drama.

35
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,350
He says he wants to eat pork cutlet and stuff.

36
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,650
What...

37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,860
Takagi...

38
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,160
What... what's wrong?

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,660
What do you mean by that?

40
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,370
Why didn't you tell us what was going on too?

41
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,240
Right, Takagi!

42
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,340
You know,

43
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,840
we've got to prepare our hearts for it too, Takagi!

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,540
What? Prepare your hearts?

45
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,950
What is this preparing your hearts about?

46
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,350
Ta... Takagi!

47
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,850
Enough.

48
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,050
So, Takagi...

49
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,650
Yes?

50
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,160
It's you, isn't it?

51
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,160
You mean the case the Inspector Megure is talking about on the phone?

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,660
Officer Takagi.

53
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,970
You can be very funny!

54
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,070
About Officer Sato...

55
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Yes.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
You see,

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,540
the stuff that's glittering on Officer Sato's finger...

58
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,450
Ran, what's up?

59
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,250
That ring...

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,950
The ring.

61
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,350
Ring?

62
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,750
Ring.

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,160
You're right.

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,560
The ring...

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,960
What? Ring?

66
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,670
It's a ring I've never seen before.

67
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,370
Moreover, he's wearing it on her left ring finger?

68
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,440
Who... who on earth did she get it from?

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,740
Cool it, cool head!

70
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,740
What's needed is composure. Calm down.

71
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,550
I'll ask Officer Sato about it.

72
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,450
Excuse me, Officer Sato. That ring...

73
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,250
Sorry.

74
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,660
I've found somebody I like.

75
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,360
Miwa.

76
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
Ms. Sato.

77
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Miwa.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,370
What's going on?

79
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,340
Wearing it on her left ring finger means...

80
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,640
She's engaged?

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,240
That's what it means, isn't it? Hey!

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,340
I'd sure like to know what it means.

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
What?

84
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,450
You mean that ring isn't what you gave her?

85
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,450
No.

86
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,550
I didn't buy it, nor have I seen it ever before.

87
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,750
Then who on earth?

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,240
Tozawa of the patrol division.

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,940
Sonenaga of the crime prevention division.

90
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,340
Taniguchi of the traffic and transportation division.

91
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,650
I'm sorry. Could you hold a moment, please?

92
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,750
Hey!

93
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,050
Hey!

94
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,550
Be quiet, will you?

95
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,350
Please.

96
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,750
Hello.

97
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,860
I'm sorry. And then?

98
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,360
What?

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,660
Someone is...

100
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,860
Someone is dead?

101
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,540
I got it, Ran.

102
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll be right over.

103
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,140
Officer Takagi! Let's go!

104
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,350
What?

105
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,450
There was a murder at a villa in Okutama!

106
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,750
Officer Takagi!

107
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,750
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,450
I'm sorry, but could you take this?

109
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,350
I would rather...

110
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I've got no choice, though.

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,360
I've got my own problems, you know.

112
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,340
It's a big problem!

113
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,490
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

114
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,800
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,600
A ring glitters on Officer Sato's left hand.

116
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Did Officer Takagi finally do it?

117
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
He sees through the one and only truth.

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

119
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,710
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"Half a day earlier" -What a fantastic ring.

123
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,610
Look at the number of stones on it. Fabulous.

124
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,710
Are they all diamonds?

125
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,180
I've never seen anything like this before.

126
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,980
That's right.

127
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,380
It's a ring that I had custom made

128
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,790
in memory of my 100th piece of work.

129
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,890
It says "100th" on the back.

130
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,190
"100th" -See.

131
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,290

132
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,200
"Mystery Author" -100 diamonds on the ring,

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,500
but they told me that doing so

134
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,600
would make the ring larger than a finger shield,

135
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,500
so they were against it.

136
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,710
I guess so.

137
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,980
Excuse me.

138
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,680
I'd like to switch the tape.

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,880
But how unusual, in this day and age

140

"Writer" -is recorded digitally,

143
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,790
but I for some reason don't feel comfortable

144
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,490
unless I see the tape spinning.

145
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
In digital recording,

146
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,900
errors are a problem too.

147
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,700
I see.

148
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
In fact, I feel the same, too.

but I just can't seem to let go of this old analogue camera

152
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
that I've been using from before.

153
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,390
Well, the only thing is, with this you can't see

154
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,090
how the pictures come out right away.

Hey, hey.

I'm sorry I have to intrude on you

and finish what you got to do.

163

Come on, cool head, Ms. Anabuki.

164

After all, Detective Mouri

have him rest well

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,100
this is like an introductory rehearsal.

173
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,800
On this month's preview page...

174
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,900
See! There's a big ad that goes,

175
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,610
"Writer Masutaka Moroguchi will have a talk out

176
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,610
with famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

177
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,780
on the new dawn of mystery stories!"

178
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,380
Please take a look at it.

179
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,780
Let's see.

180
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,690
What's the matter?

181
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,490
You look puzzled.

182
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,790
I just felt that he wasn't the kind of person I thought he was.

183
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,100
By that, do you mean Mr. Moroguchi?

184
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Because his mystery story here

185
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,800
is particular about little details.

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,010
I was sure that he would be a nervous person

187
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,110
who is always annoyed.

188
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,680
Ms. Anabuki!

189
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,880
Yes?

190
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,590
Do you have a ruler?

191
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,690
Yes.

192
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,690
I have a tape measure with me.

193
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,100
Just as I thought.

194
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
The font of my name

195
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,700
is 1 mm smaller than that of the other writers!

196
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,800
Are you trying to humiliate me or something?

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,610
No... no way.

198
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,110
It's only that a font that size looks nicer

199
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,810
and fits in much nicer, that's why.

200
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,880
Then,

201
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,480
why not make the fonts of the other writers smaller?

202
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,580
You good-for-nothing!

203
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,290
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,190
I'll make sure that nothing like this happens again.

205
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,690
Phooey! You'd better!

206
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,200
I see.

207
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,300
I guess he's nervous about everything else.

208
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,600
Really.

209
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,300
Mr. Akiba, the editor in charge before you was great.

210
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,210
He granted my every wish.

211
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,480
He must've been a capable editor.

212
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
From looking for image data

213
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,690
to investigating specialized knowledge regarding tricks...

214
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,690
He spared no pains at serving me.

215
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,100
I mean, until his life ran out on him.

216
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,200
Did... did he die?

217
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,810
This spring, he found dead at home

218
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,780
in a room that was completely locked.

219
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,980
Locked room?

220
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,780
Did he commit suicide?

221
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,890
I would think so.

222
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,490
I mean, it's not one of the mystery stories I wrote, you know.

223
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,290
In fact, I thought of writing a story based on his death,

224
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,200
but Ms. Anabuki stopped me.

225
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,800
Most naturally!

226
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,300
The fact that he died suddenly

227
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
is quite widespread, in the publishing business.

228
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,010
Therefore, writing a novel about it

229
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,510
would just make way for gossip articles.

230
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,980
That's why I asked him not to.

231
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Gossip is gossip

232
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,580
and not the truth.

233
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
Besides,

234
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,790
if it's entitled something like "A Tribute to Editor Akiba",

235
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,890
maybe it would've sold, don't you think?

236
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,890
Well...

237
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,600
What...

238
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh, no.

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,700
I'm out of lead.

240
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,400
Would you like to use mine?

241
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,990
But I use regular pencils.

242
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,690
Even though it's analogue.

243
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,590
Well, then. Thank you.

244
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, let's just decide

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
on the course of action for tomorrow for now.

246
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
After all, we're be filming tomorrow morning.

247
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,710
Taking up time eating like this is doing us no good.

248
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,380
Besides, I don't want to waste film.

249
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,390
After that,

250
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,390
talking over arrangements continued over dinner

251
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,700
for two hours.

252
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,100
We had no idea that all this work would amount to nothing.

253
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,400
Right.

254
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,410
Because the main character of the interview...

255
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,310
Mr. Moroguchi?

256
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,380
It's already 5:00 a.m!

257
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Mr. Moroguchi? Moroguchi!

258
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,790
What's the matter?

259
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,190
Mr. Mouri!

260
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,390
Is he still asleep?

261
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,390
Yes.

262
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,390
Maybe he was working till late last night.

263
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's use a spare key to open the door

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
and wake him up then!

265
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,300
The thing is,

266
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,100
Mr. Moroguchi hated for others to go into this room

267
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,010
so there is no spare key.

268
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,910
He said that he didn't want his works to be stolen.

269
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,210
Hey, Conan.

270
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,110
What're you doing?

271
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,980
I have this bad premonition.

272
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,280
Like something is pushing down on my chest.

273
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,290
I feel like I'm having difficulty breathing.

274
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,590
At times like this,

275
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,490
almost without fail...

276
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,500
It's been about an hour since he passed on.

277
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,100
The odor of almond.

278
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,200
Cyanide type poison.

279
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,110
The stuff around his mouth is coffee.

280
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,510
Was the poison mixed in his drink?

281
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,980
The room was locked completely.

282
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,580
The only place that was open

283
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,390
was the place I used to come in here.

284
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,890
Just that ventilation window,

285
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,590
only big enough for a child to barely make it through.

286
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,990
The thing that he is holding in his hand

287
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,500
is probably the key to this room.

288
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,600
Is it suicide?

289
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,100
No. This is...

290
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,900
murder?

291
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,400
The victim is a mystery novelist,

292
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,110
Mr. Masutaka Moroguchi, age 52.

293
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,610
The cause of death is suffocation

294
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,110
due to cyanide poisoning.

295
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,110
From the coffee that is left around his mouth,

296
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,210
he most likely...

297
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,020
Mixed cyanide into his drink and drank it

298
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,120
or, somebody made him drink it.

299
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,590
What is it?

300
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,690
I don't think anyone made him drink it.

301
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,390
Because the door and windows of this room

302
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,500
were completely locked.

303
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,600
It was indeed a locked room.

304
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,300
Moreover, Mr. Moroguchi is holding

305
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,700
the key to this room in his hand,

306
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,200
and neither is there a spare key.

307
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,610
Taking all these things into consideration,

308
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,010
suicide is the only thinkable conclusion, isn't it?

309
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,710
Why would it be so?

310
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,910
If someone put cyanide

311
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,910
into his coffee cup beforehand,

312
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,320
wouldn't a locked room murder be possible?

313
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Of course, that's if someone knew

314
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,090
that Mr. Moroguchi drinks coffee after getting up in the morning.

315
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,790
Idiot!

316
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,390
A person normally doesn't drink coffee

317
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,400
holding a key in his hand, does he?

318
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Of course, it would be impossible to grab the key

319
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,100
even if he were to have realized

320
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,900
that he had drunk poisoned coffee.

321
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,100
So, it's most probable

322
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,410
that he held the key before drinking the poisoned coffee.

323
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,010
So, it must be some kind of message from him.

324
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,810
But wasn't Mr. Moroguchi scheduled to have

325
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,020
a talk show with you this morning, Mr. Mouri?

326
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
If so,

327
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,190
maybe he overslept, and in his haste, picked up the key

328
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,590
before leaving the room then,

329
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,890
sipped a cup of coffee to wake himself up, right?

330
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,700
For God's sake, take a good look!

331
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,800
The coffee cup was on the floor beside the bed.

332
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,700
Yes, that's true.

333
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,810
The coffee maker's in the kitchen over that side.

334
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,010
If he were in a rush,

335
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,210
wouldn't he have made the coffee in the kitchen

336
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,210
and drunk it then and there?

337
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,810
He would never put the cup on a saucer,

338
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,120
take it his bed and drink it!

339
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,990
But what if it were this way?

340
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,690
Somebody who came to wake Mr. Moroguchi up,

341
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,690
made coffee mixed with cyanide

342
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,800
and put it beside his bed.

343
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,100
Then told him to hurry, made him hold the key

344
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,800
and left the room?

345
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,600
Not possible.

346
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,610
If so, that someone

347
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,510
would've had to leave the room

348
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,810
before Mr. Moroguchi drank the coffee,

349
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,810
and make him lock the door.

350
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,610
This sounds pretty impossible.

351
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,320
Whether or not a person drinks the coffee

352
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,520
that is served right away, depends on the person.

353
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,420
But if he were rushed,

354
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,790
he probably would've drunk it.

355
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,890
It could be that Mr. Moroguchi didn't like hot stuff

356
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,790
and didn't drink his coffee right away.

357
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,200
No way!

358
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Mr. Moroguchi liked coffee very much

359
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,400
so whether it was hot or warm,

360
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,310
he would drink it saying it was delicious.

361
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,310
Isn't that right?

362
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,310
Yes.

363
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,210
Everybody knew about it in the editing room.

364
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,520
And who are you?

365
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Yes.

366
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,990
I'm Anabuki in charge of editing for Mr. Moroguchi.

367
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,290
The two behind me,

368
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,690
are to the right, cameraman, Mr. Tarumi,

369
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,590
and to the left, Mr. Dejima, a writer.

370
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,200
Did you three come here to make plans

371
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
on the talk show this morning?

372
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,100
No, all three of us

373
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,810
spent the night here from last night.

374
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,610
I mean, it's kind of tough trying to get here

375
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,110
before 5:00 in the morning, so...

376
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,810
But, how strange.

377
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,620
If the room were locked,

378
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,920
you'd most likely break the door down

379
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,320
or crack the window,

380
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,990
but there are no such traces.

381
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,390
How did you make it into the room?

382
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,390
This brat did it! Phooey!

383
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,800
Conan went in through that ventilation window over there,

384
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,000
and opened the door from the inside for us,

385
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,910
and we got in.

386
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,010
That's when we found Mr. Moroguchi dead.

387
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,510
Which means that the window was open?

388
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,610
Yes, that's right.

389
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,820
But it's only wide enough

390
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,520
for a child to get through, isn't it?

391
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,320
Let's assume that it was suicide.

392
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,690
Yet, why would Mr. Moroguchi die

393
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,690
holding the key in his hand?

394
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe the culprit didn't want all of us here at the villa

395
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,500
to be suspected of murder.

396
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,800
Like I just said,

397
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,300
if this were murder,

398
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,110
unless the culprit said something like,

399
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,010
"Drink your coffee while holding your key and lock the door..."

400
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,810
This situation would be hard to create.

401
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,210
And?

402
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,410
Would you have any idea as to why Mr. Moroguchi

403
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,610
would want to commit suicide?

404
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,120
No. Not that I know of.

405
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,220
He didn't show any such signs, did he?

406
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,390
No, not at all.

407
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,890
Well, maybe he had a lot of things on his mind

408
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,990
that he couldn't tell others.

409
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,500
It seems that the previous editor,

410
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,600
Mr. Akiba, who was in charge of him

411
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,100
committed suicide this spring too.

412
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,410
It could be that he felt seriously responsible for what happened.

413
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,110
At any rate,

414
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,210
let's wait for the forensic officer to arrive.

415
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,010
If this is homicide,

416
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,720
the fingerprints of the culprit

417
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,420
has to be somewhere here.

418
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,590
If the culprit wore gloves when serving coffee

419
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,390
or when opening and closing the door,

420
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,890
I'm sure it would breed suspicion in Mr. Moroguchi too.

421
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,490
Besides, if the door was locked,

422
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,700
the culprit wouldn't have had time to wipe anything off.

423
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
That is, if none of you touched anything

424
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
before I got here.

425
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,300
No, because Detective Mouri warned us not to touch anything

426
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,210
until the police got here.

427
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,210
I'm sure this is a suicide case,

428
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,510
no need to call the forensic officers.

429
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,510
Officer Takagi.

430
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,420
Doesn't it bother you?

431
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,020
What do you mean?

432
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,790
The ring!

433
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,490
What? What're you talking about? Conan!

434
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,890
Well, of course it'd be a lie

435
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,200
if I said it didn't bother me,

436
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
but now we're in the middle of an investigation.

437
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,500
No!

438
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,410
Where are you looking? Over here!

439
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,610
This man's ring.

440
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,210
The number 100 that's carved is upside down.

441
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,720
Right,

442
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,720
but he could've just put it on upside down by mistake.

443
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,290
But this man was a very nervous person,

444
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,290
so I don't think he'd make such a mistake.

445
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,090
Besides, this ring...

446
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
See! There're so many diamonds on it.

447
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,100
Oh, I see!

448
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,010
So this is a homicide case after all!

449
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,510
What?

450
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,110
The reason he was killed was because of this ring!

451
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,810
The culprit switched the ring with the genuine stones on it

452
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,410
with a fake one

453
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,020
and when the culprit put the fake back on Mr. Moroguchi's finger,

454
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,220
he put it on upside down in his haste!

455
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,090
Did Mr. Moroguchi ever take this ring off?

456
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,190
No. He liked it very much,

457
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,500
so much so that he used to wear it

458
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,200
even when taking a bath and going to bed.

459
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
Then, just as Officer Takagi says,

460
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,110
there is a high probability that this is a case of homicide.

461
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,510
So, another mystery has emerged.

462
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,710
I see.

463
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,410
The only time the culprit could've switched the ring

464
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,020
is after Mr. Moroguchi died.

465
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,190
And most naturally, the culprit was in this room at that time.

466
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,690
If so,

467
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,290
how did the culprit escape from this locked room?

468
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,600
How on earth, after leaving the key in Mr. Moroguchi's hand?

469
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,900
Or is it that after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

470
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,310
the culprit left this room and locked the door,

471
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,110
and in some way returned the key

472
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,010
into Mr. Moroguchi's hand from outside?

473
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,420
Only that ventilation window was open.

474
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,820
There's nearly 4 meters from over there

475
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,920
to the hand of the corpse.

476
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,390
It's too far to do something like that.

477
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,890
Okay,

478
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,560
while we're waiting for the forensic officers to arrive,

479
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,760
I'd like you to answer my questions.

480
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,560
I would like to know where all of you were

481
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
and what you were doing

482
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,770
before finding Mr. Moroguchi's dead body.

483
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,670
First, let's start with you, Mr. Dejima.

484
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,970
I... I was in my room

485
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,670
fixing this tape recorder.

486
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,480
Something seems to be wrong with it.

487
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
The tape inside is all wrinkled

488
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,280
and when I try to rewind it...

489
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
See! This is how it sounds.

490
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,590
True. It does sound funny.

491
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,690
Next. How about you, Mr. Tarumi?

492
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,860
After I finishing setting things up for shooting,

493
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
I returned to my room

494
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,960
and was organizing the negatives for a different job.

495
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,860
I bundled them up with this rubber band.

496
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,270
Okay.

497
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,870
Then, next Ms. Anabuki.

498
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,370
I was also in my room

499
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,270
looking over the draft of another writer.

500
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,880
Ms. Anabuki.

501
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,980
You had a metal tape on you, didn't you?

502
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,180
Do you always carry it around?

503
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,780
What? Yes.

504
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,580
Because Mr. Moroguchi usually tells me

505
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,290
to measure things, like the size of the fonts.

506
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,990
But if it's to measure the fonts,

507
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,890
won't a ruler do?

508
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,160
Hey, Sonny.

509
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,960
She not only had to measure fonts,

510
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,260
but all kinds of other stuff too.

511
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,870
Like doors and windows

512
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,170
that were likely to be used as tricks.

513
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,570
You sure know a lot.

514
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,070
The late Akiba used to tell me all these things.

515
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,780
All three of us

516
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,580
joined the company together with Mr. Akiba, so...

517
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
I quit partway

518
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,680
and became a free-lance writer though.

519
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,990
I see. Is that right?

520
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,390
Officer Sato...

521
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,660
It has nothing to do with the case, but...

522
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
What is it, Ran?

523
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,560
That's probably the forensic officer.

524
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,370
I'm sorry, Ran.

525
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,770
Could you wait till later?

526
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,870
Sure.

527
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,280
It's genuine?

528
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,980
That ring was genuine?

529
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,080
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,680
It was brought back to the station

531
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,780
and taken to an appraiser right away,

532
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,490
so there's no doubt about it.

533
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,390
Which means, the culprit wasn't after the ring.

534
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,560
Yes, that's right.

535
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Then, why?

536
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,260
For what reason did the culprit remove the ring?

537
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,470
And when the ring was removed,

538
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,370
there was a strange trace left behind.

539
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,870
A strange trace?

540
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,070
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,970
Over here.

542
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,180
Although it seems to be a very old mark...

543
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,380
It's a round, black mark.

544
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,180
I wonder if it's a trace of blood?

545
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,780
Blood...

546
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,380
Why would there be blood here?

547
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,290
He could've been shaving

548
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,090
and cut himself pretty deep.

549
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,160
Then he may have touched the place.

550
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,060
See, there's a cut spot under his right jaw.

551
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,070
No doubt about it.

552
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,270
By the way,

553
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,570
from the coffee cup,

554
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,070
the saucer,

555
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,570
coffee maker,

556
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,070
and the doorknob,

557
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,380
nothing other than the victim's fingerprints have been found.

558
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,880
I see.

559
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,080
Excuse me, Officer Takagi...

560
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,280
What is it?

561
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,590
I know this is a very inappropriate time to say something like this,

562
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,590
but I just have to say it.

563
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,660
What is it, Ran?

564
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,860
Congratulations on your engagement.

565
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,060
What?

566
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,470
Ran?

567
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,870
Because see,

568
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,270
isn't the ring that Officer Sato is wearing

569
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,270
on her left hand ring finger

570
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,370
an engagement ring?

571
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,580
It looks to be so.

572
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,780
Looks to be so?

573
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,180
Aren't you the one who sent it to her, Officer Takagi?

574
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,290
I'm sure she got it from somebody, somewhere.

575
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,890
You mean she switched to somebody

576
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,290
who's more reliable and good-looking?

577
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,690
Dad!

578
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,160
Could be.

579
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,660
What do you mean, could be?

580
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,560
Why don't you go and ask her straight?

581
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,670
I wish I could.

582
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,970
I'm afraid what her answer might be.

583
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,970
Really.

584
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,870
I feel like I'm walking on a tightrope.

585
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,780
Maybe you already fell off the tightrope?

586
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,980
Could be.

587
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,580
-That's what it was. -Dad, stop teasing him!

588
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,290
That's why the culprit removed the ring.

589
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,590
The culprit did it

590
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,160
to carry out the "tightrope walk" in the locked room!

591
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,260
But something bothers me.

592
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,470
The door and the window of the room were locked.

593
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,170
Mr. Moroguchi is found in the room dead

594
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,670
after drinking coffee poisoned with cyanide.

595
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,270
In his left hand,

596
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,680
he is holding the key of the room that has no spare.

597
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,380
The only thing that was open

598
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,580
was the ventilation window

599
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
that a child can barely pass through.

600
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,980
With the information we have now,

601
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,890
it could be taken that Mr. Moroguchi committed suicide,

602
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,860
not wanting anyone else in this villa to be suspected.

603
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
But the question is,

604
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,260
why was the ring that he had on his left ring finger

605
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,170
on upside down?

606
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,570
If it's just as she says,

607
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,470
and Mr. Moroguchi didn't take this ring off

608
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,670
most of the time.

609
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,670
And taking into consideration that he was not the type

610
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,480
that would do something sloppy like wear his ring upside down.

611
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,180
After the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi to death,

612
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,180
the culprit for some reason, took off the ring

613
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,390
and when putting it back on his finger,

614
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,290
put it back on upside down.

615
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,090
Maybe the culprit removed the ring

616
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,460
only because there was blood on it?

617
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,460
Well, there was blood under the ring

618
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,170
that got on when he shaved, right?

619
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,070
That's why the culprit may have taken it off once

620
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,770
in order to wipe the blood off.

621
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,070
No. But if so,

622
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,080
the blood on the finger would've been wiped off too.

623
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Even if the culprit were to wipe the blood off the ring,

624
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,180
if the blood on the finger isn't wiped off,

625
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,580
it would be meaningless.

626
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,680
I think the culprit wiped the blood off

627
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,090
without taking the ring off, don't you?

628
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,590
I guess so.

629
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,790
Maybe that man...

630
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,460
was sewing?

631
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,260
Sewing?

632
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Just what do you mean, Conan?

633
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,870
Yes, because you see,

634
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,170
the other day when Ran made me the rag to take to school,

635
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,470
she was also wearing a ring, right, Ran?

636
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,980
Are you talking about the finger shield?

637
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,580
When you wear it,

638
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,880
it makes it easier to pull the string

639
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
through the hole of the needle, right?

640
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,380
No! Conan.

641
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,680
A finger shield is worn

642
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,690
to hold the back of the needle down.

643
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,090
What?

644
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,360
I thought that you wore it

645
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,560
and pulled something through the hole of the needle!

646
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,770
I guess I made a mistake.

647
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,070
Pulled something through the hole of the key?

648
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,170
So, the ring?

649
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,080
I... I get it!

650
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,380
Pops!

651
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,890
Rubberband!

652
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,390
Rubberband?

653
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,690
First, you take the rubberbands

654
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,090
and hook them up together.

655
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,900
You pull the ring through the rubberbands

656
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,760
and make a sling.

657
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,770
Then the front and back part of the key

658
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,970
are hooked on to each end of the rubberband.

659
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,070
The key was then

660
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,370
flown from the ventilation window into the room!

661
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,770
The length of the rubberbands

662
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,870
can be adjusted to the desired length

663
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,380
just by connecting rubberbands!

664
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,180
Of course, the culprit did this

665
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,980
after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

666
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,380
locking the room up and leaving.

667
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,890
And the only one who could've done this is

668
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,990
the one who still has

669
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,990
a number of rubberbands around his wrist.

670
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,190
Cameraman, Mr. Tarumi.

671
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,090
You!

672
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,860
How about it? Am I wrong?

673
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,470
No. I... I didn't do it!

674
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,770
Pops, wrong.

675
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,970
But if he were the one,

676
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,580
the rubberbands should still be in the room, shouldn't they?

677
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,380
After all, they were flown in here together with the key.

678
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,480
Then, it must've been just one side!

679
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,780
The culprit held one end of the rubberband

680
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,790
and passed the key through the other end to fling it!

681
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,890
That way,

682
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,590
he can retrieve the rubberband

683
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,790
by pulling on the end that he is holding!

684
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:59,090
Even if the culprit were able to retrieve it that way,

685
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,560
the knot made in the rubberband

686
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
would hook on to the ring and be pulled.

687
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,670
So, I think that the victim's arm

688
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,470
would be hanging facing outward from the bed.

689
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,670
Besides,

690
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,170
I wonder if the culprit would choose to carry out

691
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,670
an extremely difficult feat as to fly the key into the room

692
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,680
and place it on the victim's hand?

693
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,580
If the method fails, it would just look as if

694
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,380
the key was thrown in from the ventilation window.

695
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,890
That's true too.

696
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,590
I mean, it couldn't be taken any other way!

697
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,590
Darn. I'd like to put Pops to sleep like always

698
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,690
and start a deduction show,

699
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,760
but since Officer Sato is here...

700
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,970
She almost saw through the other time too.

701
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,070
I guess I'll just have to

702
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,770
lead him into realizing what really happened.

703
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,670
Right, Pops!

704
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,570
I don't think that even a circus performer

705
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,280
could do something like that!

706
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,780
Circus?

707
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,580
You mean magician, don't you?

708
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,780
But Officer Takagi just mentioned it a while ago.

709
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,190
He said tightrope.

710
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,490
This means that you both

711
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,290
are going to do a circus performance, right?

712
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,600
Hey, Conan!

713
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,260
-That's... -What is it, Officer Takagi?

714
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,570
Conan.

715
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,970
-Much too cruel. -Wait. Tightrope?

716
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,670
Tightrope...

717
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,270
I see! There's the stuff!

718
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,080
The thing that can be used to retrieve the rubberband right away

719
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
without getting stuck on the ring.

720
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,880
A long and slender thing!

721
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,580
You finally got it, Pops.

722
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,890
That is the thing that editor Ms. Anabuki...

723
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,590
The metal tape measure!

724
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,890
Are you saying that the ring

725
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,100
was pulled through the tape measure?

726
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,870
No, the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape.

727
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,370
And then that tape measure

728
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,070
was pulled through the hole of the key

729
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,670
and was taken from outside the ventilation window

730
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,370
to the palm of Mr. Moroguchi's hand!

731
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,080
Just like in tightrope!

732
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,780
Hey, hold it!

733
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,180
When was that tape measure pulled through

734
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,580
the hole of the key?

735
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,080
That's of course,

736
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,090
right after the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi!

737
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,390
The key was pulled through the tape beforehand,

738
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,490
then the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape,

739
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,690
then extended over to the ventilation window.

740
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,890
If the tape measure

741
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,760
is hooked onto the rim of the window along with the key,

742
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
after committing the crime, all that needs to be done

743
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,970
is to pull the tape measure up.

744
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,570
Then the key will move along the tape measure

745
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,570
all the way up to Mr. Moroguch's palm!

746
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,680
Of course, it can be retrieved with the push of a button too!

747
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,980
So,

748
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,280
if the culprit pulls the key through the tape

749
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
before leaving the room,

750
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,990
it would be impossible to lock the door, right?

751
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,390
Oh, I see.

752
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,690
No, no.

753
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,190
Maybe the culprit extended the tape measure

754
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,090
after committing the murder and leaving the room,

755
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,060
and after going over to the ventilation window from outside.

756
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,170
See!

757
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,870
Metal tape measures are stiff

758
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,270
so the culprit probably used it like a stick,

759
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,770
and hooked the tip of the measure nicely

760
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,770
onto the ring of the dead body.

761
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,080
Only up to 1 meter though.

762
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,580
If it goes beyond that, it'll break.

763
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,080
It's impossible to get it to reach the bed,

764
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,480
much less, the palm of his hand.

765
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,780
Besides,

766
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,580
if the culprit only had to hook the tape measure onto the ring,

767
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,890
there's no need to remove the ring at all, is there?

768
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,290
That... that's true.

769
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,590
Yes. If there's a narrow string-like thing,

770
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,690
then maybe it's possible.

771
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,570
But the three suspects had nothing like that on them.

772
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,970
The vicinity around the villa is being investigated,

773
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,270
but there's been no report of anything like that being found yet.

774
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,570
Of course nothing would be found, right?

775
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,080
Unlike the rubberband,

776
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,880
there could never be something that won't get stuck by the ring,

777
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,280
that is thin and slippery like a long string,

778
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,580
that's so convenient

779
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,080
that it's usually wound around something

780
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,980
like a tape measure when not in use.

781
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,890
Wait!

782
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,790
Hey! Don't tell me that's...

783
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,690
-Cassette tape! -Cassette tape!

784
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,100
I see.

785
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,660
If a cassette tape were used,

786
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,360
the tape could be pulled out to quite a length

787
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,970
and put through the ring.

788
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,470
Then, if the tip of the tape and the cassette itself

789
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,870
are left outside the ventilation window...

790
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,870
After killing Mr. Moroguchi with poison,

791
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,180
the culprit can leave the room, lock the door,

792
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,180
put the tip of the tape that is left

793
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,180
outside the ventilation window through the hole of the key

794
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,680
and hold the tape up high...

795
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,590
Then, due to gravity,

796
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,790
the key would slide along the tape

797
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,290
and reach the palm of the dead man's hand.

798
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,290
Then, if the tape is wound back,

799
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,500
it will slide through the hole of the key and the ring,

800
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,960
and return to the cassette,

801
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,270
succeeding in locking the room up!

802
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,570
The one who could've used this trick is

803
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,370
someone who usually carries around cassette tapes

804
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,780
and wouldn't be suspected by the police

805
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,280
even if investigated.

806
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,780
Is there such a person here...

807
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,380
Mr. Dejima, the writer.

808
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,990
You're the only one thinkable.

809
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,590
You probably said something like,

810
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,190
wanting to make the finishing touches

811
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,890
on the talk show that was scheduled for this morning

812
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,460
and got Mr. Moroguchi to let you into this room.

813
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,470
And when he was off his guard,

814
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,670
you mixed cyanide into his coffee

815
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,470
and poisoned him to death.

816
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,970
Then you set up the locked room trick

817
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,270
using the method that was just explained.

818
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,480
Well? Am I wrong?

819
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,380
Well, we'll find out if we check

820
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,190
the cassette tapes that you have.

821
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,390
I'll bet you want to say that it'll be wrinkled up,

822
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,690
but did I say that myself?

823
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,890
This recorder...

824
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,260
is not working well.

825
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,370
There are many tapes that are wrinkled.

826
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,370
Besides, with all the noise it makes

827
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,070
when the tape is rewound,

828
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,170
someone is bound to have heard it!

829
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,280
If without using this,

830
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,680
the tape was rewound manually,

831
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
the wrinkled parts of the tape

832
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,280
would be spread over a large portion of the tape.

833
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,890
Please feel free to check them.

834
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,490
I have no such tape on me.

835
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,490
No.

836
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,590
A pencil!

837
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,190
If you use the pencil

838
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,560
that you borrowed from Mr. Moroguchi last night,

839
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,960
stick the pencil into the hole of the cassette

840
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,870
and wind the tape,

841
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,770
the recorder doesn't have to be used,

842
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,170
to rewind the tape in a short time

843
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,570
without damaging the tape that much.

844
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,880
I used to do it a lot when I was a kid too.

845
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,980
After pulling a lot of tape out for fun,

846
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,880
I rewound the tape by placing a pencil on my lap.

847
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,890
Besides, when Officer Sato mentioned checking the tapes,

848
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,590
she didn't say it to mean checking on wrinkled tapes.

849
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,390
Like mentioned before,

850
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,460
blood was on the base of the left ring finger,

851
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,970
where he wore the ring.

852
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,270
However, for some reason,

853
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,270
there was no blood on one part.

854
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,770
Therefore, among the tapes that you have,

855
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,870
there should be one that was used

856
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,280
to tightrope across the locked room

857
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,980
with Mr. Moroguchi's blood on it.

858
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,680
Mr. Dejima.

859
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,480
Don't tell me that you killed him because of Akiba...

860
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,390
Tightrope...

861
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,790
Akiba used to tell me too,

862
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,290
that getting along with Mr. Moroguchi

863
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,860
was always like walking on a tightrope.

864
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,770
Tightrope?

865
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,870
Akiba used to be a quiet man,

866
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,670
but ever since he became in charge of Mr. Moroguchi,

867
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,270
he always had bandages around him somewhere.

868
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,680
What do you think it was?

869
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,080
He was trying out

870
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
something that Mr. Moroguchi told him to try.

871
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,780
He was testing whether the murder trick

872
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,380
that Mr. Moroguchi thought up would really work,

873
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,790
using his own body.

874
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,290
Of course, he was very careful

875
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,890
so as not to really die doing it.

876
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,490
Hey, then don't tell me that you...

877
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,160
That thing about Akiba dying in a locked room...

878
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,770
I found it when I was cleaning out

879
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,170
Akiba's desk at the company.

880
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,170
"Mr. Moroguchi's Trick Note"

881
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,470
A notebook with the exact method of dying

882
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,080
that Akiba died of!

883
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,680
Then, why didn't you submit it to the police?

884
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,380
No use.

885
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,980
Mr. Moroguchi would probably say

886
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,090
Akiba did it of his own free will, even if he were questioned.

887
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,790
But it was an accident, wasn't it?

888
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,390
Mr. Moroguchi said the following at another interview.

889
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,890
At this age,

890
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm finally beginning to understand

891
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,970
the feeling of a murderer.

892
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,370
Nothing can be more delightful than this

893
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,070
for a detective story writer.

894
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,470
That's what he said.

895
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,870
So that's when I was convinced

896
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,780
that what Mr. Moroguchi wanted to know using Akiba

897
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,180
was not reality

898
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,680
but rather, the mentality of a killer.

899
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,170
Well, something's been bothering me for quite some time.

900
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,080
What is it?

901
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,780
What do you mean what is it?

902
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,180
What's this thing about tightrope with me?

903
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,580
Just what does that mean?

904
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,590
Well, that's... You see...

905
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,990
The ring!

906
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,090
Officer Sato, you say that you don't like jewelry

907
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,490
and yet you're wearing a ring.

908
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,390
Officer Takagi wants to know why.

909
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,660
Maybe I should've come along with Pops by train.

910
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,870
You mean this good luck charm to keep away evil?

911
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,770
-Good luck charm? -Good luck charm?

912
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,370
That's all?

913
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,480
Just what do you mean?

914
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,780
Silver and turquoise.

915
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,380
Wearing this on the left ring finger,

916
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,480
keeps bad luck and bugs away from me,

917
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,480
so I get to kill two birds with one stone.

918
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,890
That's what Yumi told me, so I decided to get one too!

919
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,990
Because, you see, I'm cursed and hate bugs too.

920
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,860
Well, I don't think Yumi was really talking about bugs.

921
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,760
If... if so...

922
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,470
Officer Sato!

923
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,470
Please wear my ring on your left ring finger!

924
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,170
Okay.

925
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,080
Oh, boy, am I in trouble?

926
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,480
I'll bet I'm going to get it from everybody today.

927
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,990
I mean, after all, Officer Sato's going to be wearing my ring

928
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,390
on her left ring finger.

929
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,990
"First Investigation Division"

930
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,590
I guess I'll act upright

931
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,460
and be a man today.

932
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,370
Takagi!

933
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,670
I heard about Officer Sato's ring.

934
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,170
Here it comes.

935
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,370
That ring...

936
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,480
was a lucky charm to keep away evil, right?

937
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,680
Why does everybody know about it?

938
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,180
Don't worry about it.

939
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,880
No big deal!

940
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,380
But to think she didn't know what it meant

941
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,690
to wear a ring on her left ring finger...

942
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,190
Her being naive makes her even more attractive.

943
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,190
Come to think of it, I didn't tell her

944
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,460
what that ring means yet.

945
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,960
Oh, well...

946
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,320
Next Conan's Hint:

947
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,800
"Take-out delivery service".

948
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,020
In the next episode, a famous person will appear.

949
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,580
A friend of ours is a celebrity!
