Ms. Kobayashi!

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:12,502
You talked things over with everybody after the hearing, right?

4
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:15,102
Yes, all of the lay judges

5
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,602
get together and discuss the case.

6
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:20,602
How is it? Is the defendant guilty after all?

7
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:23,602
Which decision was greater, guilty or not guilty?

8
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:26,005
Of course I can't tell you that!

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,802
Who cares? We'll keep it a secret.

10
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:32,002
I said no, and I mean no!

11
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,502
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi!

12
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,302
-Wait! -Tell us!

13
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,602
What about the picture that

14
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:40,002
Ms. Kobayashi asked a question about?

15
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:42,902
Just like she said, the picture was upside down.

16
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,402
And who could've done that?

17
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:46,602
If that's figured out,

18
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:49,502
I think we'll also be able to solve the case.

19
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:50,802
I guess so.

20
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,033
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

21
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,302
Tears are the start of all dramas.

22
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:58,037
The truth of the case that the flower vase leads to.

23
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:00,602
The courtroom is shaken by the surprising sentence that is passed.

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,302
He sees through the one and only truth.

No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,549
Ms. Kobayashi is chosen as a lay judge.

28
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,449
The one who's going to be working for the defendant is

29
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,849
Ran's mother, Attorney At Law Kisaki.

30
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:02,161
Confronting her is Madonna Prosecutor Kujo.

31
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,749
Although the defendant has a lot of evidence against him,

32
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:07,349
Attorney at Law Kisaki manages to get around,

33
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,449
and the hearing is a tie for the two women for now.

34
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:16,175
The upside down picture that Ms. Kobayashi was concerned about,

35
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,177
also concerned me.

36
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,181
The picture was verified at the scene of the crime,

37
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,185
and an IOU agreement signed by the defendant was found.

38
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:29,649
What an unexpected surprise evidence this was.

39
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:32,549
However, the housekeeper,

40
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,849
Hara at the victim's residence is also acting strange.

41
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,349
What on earth is the outcome of the hearing going to be?

42

44

"Toshio Iwamatsu (35)" -What? My IOU was in the back of the picture?

45
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,449
Why did you hide the fact

46
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,349
that you borrowed money from Mr. Ishigaki?

47
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:02,949
Just because I borrowed money from that guy,

48
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,849
I was on the verge of losing my store

49
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,225
in exchange for paying off my debts.

50
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,549
But if I told you what I thought,

51
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,231
I'd be even more suspected.

52
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,449
That's why...

53
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,549
The prosecution is thinking of using the evidence

54
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,949
as your motive for killing the victim.

55
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,243
No, I just went to get the IOU back!

56
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,849
You really haven't touched the picture?

57
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,549
No, because this is the first time

58
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,649
I'm hearing that it was hidden behind the picture.

59
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,349
Please believe me!

60
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,949
It's not whether I believe you or not,

61
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,949
but rather, whether we can convince the lay judges or not.

62
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,949
At any rate, I'll try to find a way out

63
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,749
of this crisis by the next hearing.

64
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:53,649
That's right, didn't you see a flower vase in that room?

65
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,275
What? A flower vase?

66
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:58,749
Yeah.

67
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,049
I saw a flower vase!

68
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,749
So, it was there.

Ran, you're here.

74
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,849
I came here together with Conan after school

75
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,309
because he says he wants to talk to you, mom.

76
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,749
You mean about the flower vase

77
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,313
you wanted me to ask the defendant about?

78
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,315
Yes, and what did he say?

79
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,317
Just as you said,

80
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,049
there seems to have been a flower vase in that room, Conan.

81
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,449
There is no mention of a flower vase

82
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,549
on the report of the scene made by the police.

83
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:48,649
It could be that someone walked off with it.

84
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,349
Does the vase have something to do with the case?

85
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:53,849
The only thing that disappeared

86
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,049
from the site was not only the murder weapon.

87
00:05:56,049 --> 00:06:00,339
When the defendant saw the flower vase, where was it?

88
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,949
Give me a minute.

89
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:08,049
It fell from this shelf and rolled to about here, it seems.

90
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,749
Near the door...

91
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:16,849
Yes, this is Kisaki Law Office.

92
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,149
What?

93
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,361
Yes, she's here.

94
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,649
Who is it?

95
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,449
It's from Prosecutor Kujo.

96
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,049
This is Kisaki.

97
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,149
What? The murder weapon's been found?

98
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,549
The pool cleaners found it at the bottom of the pool

99
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:41,949
located in a pool at 3-Mizushima-cho.

100
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,383
And as a result of forensic examination,

101
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,449
"Reiko Kujo (33)" -it was found to have been

102
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,349
used to commit the murder.

103
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:53,449
How nice of you to go out of your way to tell me about it.

104
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,149
But, isn't Mizushima-cho located some distance away

105
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,549
from the culprit's escape route?

106
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:03,249
The time the crime was committed seems to

107
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,649
have been 15 minutes earlier than what we estimated.

108
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,407
Around that time, we got a new eye-witness report

109
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,149
a figure that looked to be Iwamatsu

110
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:13,049
was in the vicinity of the Ishigaki residence.

111
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,749
This may be the first time Ms. Kisaki

112
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:21,949
who's had a successions of victories will experience losing a case.

113
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:22,949
See you then.

114
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,749
You can look forward to tomorrow's hearing.

115
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,949
Have they found the murder weapon?

116
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,949
It seems that only evidence

117
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,749
working against the defendant comes up.

118
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,249
The IOU and all, are fatal evidence.

119
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,449
No use brooding.

120
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,149
Once we take on a client,

121
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,349
it's our job to do our best for the defendant.

122
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,849
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,455
Things are starting to get kind of tough.

124
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,949
I guess I'll go a bit out of my way for the sake of Ran's mom!

Yes.

129
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,949

is going to help capture the real culprit of the incident

131
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:20,149
that occurred here so we came to check the place out.

and is going through a hearing now.

134
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:28,487
He's not the real culprit.

135
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,549
What? Who said so?

136
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:35,049
Like we just said, the great detective Kogoro Mouri!

137
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,449
The culprit is another person

138
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:39,949
who broke into the house and killed the president

139
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:44,503
-to steal an expensive vase... -That can't be! That vase is...

140
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:49,149
Come on, I don't know if he's a great detective or what

141
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,509
but the trial is in progress right now.

142
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,149
The culprit's going through a hearing.

143
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:57,749
Are you sure she said, "That vase"?

144
00:08:57,749 --> 00:08:59,149
No mistake about it!

145
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,349
Come on, it's about time you tell us.

146
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,849
Did that lady steal the vase?

147
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:06,249

who committed the crime?

You'll learn about it soon.

150
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,049
I'm sure that the lady will tell us about the vase

during the previous hearing.

an IOU in the amount of three million yen.

00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,613
And the murder weapon that

167
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,049
could not be found was also discovered.

168
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,049
The blood that was found on it

169
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,619
matched the blood of the victim.

170
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,249
I know nothing of it! I don't know of that knife!

171
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,625
Darn it!

172
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:50,049
-Do you want to turn me into a murderer? -Mr. Iwamoto, please calm down!

173
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,449
Darn it!

174
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,633
-Order in the court! -Let me go!

175
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:58,249
The defendant must refrain from using unruly language.

176
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,645
Things look in favor of Madonna.

177
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,049
What about the vase?

178
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,649
This is just the beginning.

179
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:11,849
What?

180
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:15,549
Does the defense have any objections

181
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,349
about using the new evidence submitted by the prosecution?

182
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:21,149
No objection, your honor.

183
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,661
However, I'd like to request cross-examination

184
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:26,665
of housekeeper Hara once again.

185
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,667
What is she up to calling her out

186
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,049
to the witness stand again at this point?

187
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,675
Does the witness have any recollection

188
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,549
of seeing this flower vase?

189
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:44,049
Yes. It's the flower vase that was in Mr. Ishigaki's study.

190
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,685
When did you see it?

191
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,689
I'm sure it was there on the day of the incident.

192
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,691
Before I went to clean the second floor,

193
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,149
I cleaned the study room.

194
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,049
So, I'm sure about it.

195
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,049
What's going on?

196
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,049
There was no flower vase

197
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:03,349
among the things left behind at the scene.

198
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:07,649
When is the next time you saw this flower vase and where?

199
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,149
The following day after the incident...

200
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:12,149
in the trash dump.

201
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,713
I headed for the residence like always to start my work day,

202
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,715
but the house was closed off.

203
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,717
So having no other choice,

204
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,849
I decided to go back home...

205
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,723
and found this flower vase in the trash dump.

206
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:25,849
"Whoever dumped this, please take it back."

207
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,249
"We are not collecting nonflammable garbage today."

208
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:30,729
I wonder why it was in a place like that.

209
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,549
So, you took it with you?

210
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:38,737
I just took it with me temporarily. It's true.

211
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:42,741
If nobody noticed, I'll bet you wanted to steal it.

212
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:43,949
Objection!

213
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,249
We are here to adjudicate a homicide case.

214
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,249
The questions by the defense pertain to the suspected theft

215
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,149
of the witness, and is clearly a tactic to buy time.

216
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,049
Will the defense explain to the court,

217
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,749
the nature of the question?

218
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,449
I would like to call to the stand a man who was present

219
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,149
when this vase was discovered,

220
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,949
a new witness, Kogoro Mouri.

221
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,769
Showtime, dad!

222
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,549
How dare she introduce me as if I was just a part of the evidence

223
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:13,649
left behind at the crime scene.

224
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,249
-Pops, there dust on your suit! -What?

225
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,449
Okay, off I go!

226
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,783
We're counting on you, Pops!

227
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:38,285
Please explain the connection of this flower vase to the case.

228
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:43,185
Why did the vase disappear?

229
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:47,085
Because the culprit hid the murder weapon knife inside it

230
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:50,085
to remove it from the study room, the scene of the crime!

231
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,811
Objection! He's only assuming.

232
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:57,685
Can you see the soiled part on the inside of the vase?

233
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,585
The brownish part...

234
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,823
Don't tell me it's blood!

235
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:08,285
When I got this back from the housekeeper

236
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:14,185
an inspiration flashed through my grayish brain cells!

237
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:18,085
Don't tell me that you were trying to steal this vase,

238
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:19,385
but the victim found you, so you stabbed him.

239
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:21,185
No way!

240
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:24,585
I didn't do such a thing!

241
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:28,485
The stain on the inside of the vase looks like blood.

242
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:29,785
What?

243
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:35,485
No doubt, it's blood!

244
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,185
There're stains on the bottom of the vase too!

245
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:43,485
If you doubt my perfect deduction,

246
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:46,485
try comparing the blood that is left on this vase

247
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,867
to that of the victim's.

248
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,885
Even so, you can't tell if they're blood stains

249
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:52,485
from the murder weapon.

250
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:55,985
After stabbing the victim, the culprit hid this knife

251
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:59,785
inside the vase and took it out of the study room.

252
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,985
The culprit left the vase behind in the trash dump,

253
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,197
took only the knife and fled!

254
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,018
Why did the culprit do something as troublesome as that

255
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:09,618
when the culprit could've fled

256
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,889
along with the murder weapon to begin with?

257
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,918
No, so like I was saying...

258
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,518
if the blood on the knife got on his clothes,

259
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:15,818
it would leave stains behind...

260
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:18,118
When the defendant was arrested,

261
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:22,318
the blood of the victim was found on his shirt sleeve and slacks.

262
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:23,618
I wonder if he would've bothered

263
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,018
to think about getting blood stains on himself?

264
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:28,907
No, so...

265
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:32,418
Hey! Didn't you figure out the truth?

266
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,913
Well, you see...

267
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,418
Pops, I'll take care of things from here!

268
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,318
What on earth is happening?

269
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,925
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

270
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,218
What?

271
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:51,418
The victim was stabbed to death

272
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,018
before the defendant snuck into the house.

273
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:59,418
Most probably when housekeeper Hara was vacuuming the room upstairs.

274
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:03,418
She testified that she thought she heard noise downstairs,

275
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:07,618
at that time, the victim was probably

276
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:12,018
killed by the culprit in the first floor study.

277
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,418
The culprit probably took the picture off the wall

278
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,418
and took what he was looking for away

279
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:18,518
from behind the frame of the picture.

280
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:22,961
However, the culprit heard a strange sound just then...

281
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,718
The culprit was probably in more than in a great hurry

282
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,118
because he didn't even realize

283
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:29,818
he hung the picture back on upside down.

284
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:33,818
And the person who came sneaking in

285
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:37,518
was the defendant who came to look for his IOU.

286
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:41,718
Then, he found President Ishigaki's corpse.

287
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,618
And then there...

288
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:59,918
Are you back?

289
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,318
Mr. Ishigaki?

290
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:08,218
Back then, the culprit hid the knife

291
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,718
in the flower vase that was nearby

292
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:12,818
and came back in as if he just got there.

293
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:16,018
As if he just got back?

294
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,918
Then the real culprit is...

295
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,318
Right.

296
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,718
The one who appeared in the in the study right after Ms. Hara.

297
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,025
What's wrong, Ms. Hara?

298
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,818
Yes.

299
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:32,018
The culprit is you, Mr. Tsukamoto!

300
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:41,039
What do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

301
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,318
Mr. Tsukamoto, I know everything.

302
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:47,818
At the time the corpse was found,

303
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,047
you probably touched it

304
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,518
because you wanted to distract attention

305
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,818
from the blood that was already on your clothes from killing the victim...

306
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,818
You made Ms. Hara go and call an ambulance

307
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,518
and during that time...

308
00:17:58,518 --> 00:18:01,718
you took the vase that you hid the knife inside,

309
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:04,518
out of the study and took it with you,

310
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:09,518
leaving it at the trash dump that is behind the house.

311
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:12,418
After finishing interrogation at the police station,

312
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:16,018
on your way home, you took the knife and gloves out of the vase,

313
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:17,818
and took it home with you.

314
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:20,618
The flower vase was supposed to be collected

315
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,518
along with the trash the following day.

316
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,083
However,

317
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,087
unfortunately, it wasn't inflammable trash collection day.

318
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,089
So, the flower vase that was left at the trash dump

319
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:34,418
was taken home by Ms. Hara.

320
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:38,418
Moreover, since the question of the missing murder weapon

321
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,218
was brought up during the first hearing,

322
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:43,718
you rushed over to the pool in the park and disposed of it there.

323
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:45,518
You were hoping that it would be found when they drain the water

324
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:46,818
in order to clean the pool.

325
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:49,107
That's enough!

326
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:52,218
Why would I have to kill my brother-in-law?

327
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:56,618
As to that, Attorney at Law Kisaki should've checked on it.

328
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,518
We have testimony that as chief manager, you,

329
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:01,418
Mr. Tsukamoto embezzled money from the company

330
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:04,318
and was on bad terms with the victim.

331
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:08,518
That's only a rumor! Where's the proof?

332
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:10,218
Did you find my fingerprints on the frame

333
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,518
of the picture or something?

334
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,818
I'm sure not...

335
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:17,135
because you would've been wearing gloves when committing the crime.

336
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,718
See.

337
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:21,418
Lay judges, please make sure that

338
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,718
you take that part into consideration!

339
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,518
Mr. Mouri.

340
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:31,618
But, what about when you took the gloves

341
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,018
and knife out of the flower vase?

342
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:37,718
The gloves were inside the flower vase,

343
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,157
so I'm sure when you were taking them out,

344
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,159
you did it with bare hands.

345
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,718
I checked the inside of the flower vase just to be sure,

346
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:45,918
and...

347
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,718
just as I expected, there was...

348
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:57,818
a bloody fingerprints.

349
00:19:57,818 --> 00:19:59,818
When you took out the gloves and knife,

350
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:02,018
blood smeared on your fingertips.

351
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:04,618
That's what you left behind.

352
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:08,418
But, since you wanted to get out of there as soon as possible,

353
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:10,418
it didn't cross your mind.

354
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,218
Besides, you obviously figured that

355
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:16,618
the trash would be collected the following day anyway.

356
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:19,197
The one who could move the flower vase

357
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,418
that was at the scene of the crime, and move it to the trash dump.

358
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:25,203
And the owner of the blood smeared fingerprints

359
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:29,207
left on the vase is indeed the real killer!

360
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,518
I would like to formally submit this flower vase as evidence,

361
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:37,018
Prosecution. Any objections?

362
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,218
We will take the flower vase immediately to forensics

363
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,219
and have them check the traces of blood

364
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,518
as well as the fingerprints on it.

365
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:48,218
He's the one to blame. That greedy guy...

366
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:51,818
He took away the deed for land that my older sister left me,

367
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:57,235
saying it was in return for the money I embezzled!

368
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,818
That's why that day when he wasn't home, I...

369
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,118
I recalled hearing about a picture

370
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:06,018
from my older sister in the past.

371
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,618
Ishiga, what do you think you're doing?

372
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,251
Ishiga, what're you doing acting like a petty thief?

373
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,118
I tried to overlook things because you're my brother-in-law,

374
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:18,318
and you go and embezzled money from the company.

375
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,818
This time, you're robbing me?

376
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:25,818
Please! That land is what my older sister gave me.

377
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,265
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,818
You're not getting a cent from me!

379
00:21:29,818 --> 00:21:33,271
I could just turn you into the police, you know.

380
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,618
If you don't want me to do that,

381
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:37,275
don't you ever show your face to me again!

382
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:44,418
I didn't want to give my older sister's land to him no matter what.

383
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:48,018
Not that land!

384
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:54,918
Regarding the murder charges against suspect Toru Tsukano,

385
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,718
I would like to make preparations to press charges against him.

386
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,318
Please stand beside the great Detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

387
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,718
How do you feel about having asked a question

388
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,389
that lead to solving the case?

389
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,718
I was honestly really surprised,

390
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:37,395
but I am delighted that I contributed to solving the case!

391
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,818
Ms. Kobayashi's become a hero.

392
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,918
Not a hero but a heroine.

393
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:45,118
No wonder she's advisor for the Youth Detective Squad!

394
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:48,318
And all she said was, "the picture is upside down".

395
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:50,918
If there is any other need to attend a hearing,

396
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:53,118
I will gladly take the job, so call me.

397
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:55,918
I don't think that'll ever happen again.

398
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,120
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,700
"Sour".

400
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,770
What comes to mind when you say, bitter sweet?

401
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,048
-The taste of a kiss. -A kiss? How did you know?

402
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,180
-Just kidding -What?
