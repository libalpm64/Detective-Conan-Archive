1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,450
While flourishing as a high-school detective,

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,410
I was shrunken into a child by the Black Organization

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,310
with their mysterious drug.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,610
Hailing from an immoral criminal syndicate,

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,310
they placed little weight on the lives of others.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,320
"The Black Organization"

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,990
As such, the war between myself and the Black Organization

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,390
has continued day after day.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,090
Yes. The war fought as Detective Conan Edogawa.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,200
"Ai Haibara"

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,500
The codename for that drug is APOPTOXIN 4869 (APTX 4869).

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,200
It's something I developed for the Black Organization.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,010
However, it remains in prototype testing.

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,310
Ai Haibara.

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,410
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,610
In the Organization, she was known as Sherry.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,980
I began to distrust the Black Organization

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,990
and escaped by taking the drug.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,090
That's after my elder sister was murdered.

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,990
By him.

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,990
Gin.

22
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,900
"Gin"

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
This man was precisely the scoundrel

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,700
who is responsible for changing me into this state.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
"Vodka"

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,700
Along with his partner Vodka,

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,310
it's likely they've been involved in numerous crimes.

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,110
By chance, we once ran across Gin's car in the middle of town.

29
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,410
We tried to tail them

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,080
but Haibara was soon captured by their compatriots.

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,290
Haibara, you're in danger!

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,390
They're coming!

33
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,500
I instructed Haibara to drink Paikar,

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,600
an alcohol that would temporarily revert her body to normal.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
And tried to aid her escape.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
But...

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,710
Gin had been lying in wait there.

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,610
Hurry into the chimney!

39
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,320
It was exceedingly dangerous,

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,080
but somehow, I managed to retrieve Haibara from them.

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,190
The FBI agents, Jodie and Akai,

42
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,990
began their investigation in secret.

43
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,400
Those two were after...

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,900
"Vermouth" -Vermouth.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,200
Vermouth disguised herself as the school physician,

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,100
Dr. Araide, while searching for Sherry.

47
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,710
And eventually, she found us.

48
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,010
I inadvertently requested a house call without suspecting anything

49
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,480
since Ai's cold had become severe.

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,590
Our cover was blown.

51
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,090
Both Haibara's and mine.

52
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,890
My apologies for being so last minute,

53
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,990
but would it be all right to take you there now?

54
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,200
I disguised myself as Haibara and accepted Vermouth's invitation.

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,600
The FBI also set up a trap.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Vermouth, the FBI and I.

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
It became a spectacular battle between us three.

58
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,910
Vermouth's plan of targeting Haibara went astray.

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,290
From this incident, we acquired some information on the Organization.

60
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,490
Right. It turns out the dial tone for their boss's e-mail address

61
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,090
resembles the "Seven Kids" melody.

62
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,790
"Seven Kids"

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,000
And tonight, along with this "Seven Kids" melody,

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,300
an assassination plot will soon be put into motion.

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Just who is their target?

66
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,620
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

67
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,390
We're proudly presenting you, the next vice president,

68
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,090
candidate for the whole town, Kevin Brown.

69
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,890
Please give a big hand.

70
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:12,910
-Kevin... -Kevin...

71
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,400
I did it!

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,300
500 yards.

73
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,410
Cleared.

74
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,910
It's your turn next!

75
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,310
Just as expected!

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,700
600 yards, cleared!

77
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,800
Kevin Brown dies three times!

78
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,210
Four times.

79
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,710
They're pretty good.

80
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,090
Too bad!

81
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,890
If I clear this one...

82
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,790
It's my win!

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,900
I got this.

84
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,010
It seems 600 yards is as far as they can go.

85
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,010
That's it...

86
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,010
Gin!

87
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,810
Wait! Let me try once more!

88
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,920
There's no need to.

89
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,790
Our prey this time will be only 200 or 300 yards away at most.

90
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,690
That means...

91
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,490
Chianti.

92
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,300
Korn.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,700
You got work to do.

94
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,080
I don't have all day!

95
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,190
I'm sorry!

96
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,310
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

97
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,110
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

98
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,810
Finally, a confrontation with the Black Organization!

99
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,010
Dire straits comes one after another and ultimately the target of terror!

100
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,410
He sees through the one and only truth.

101
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,120
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

102
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,080
His name is Detective Conan!

103
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,710
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out"

104
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:24,230
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out"

105
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,470
How was it?

106
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,280
That concludes our "Yoko Okino's Four-Minute Cooking".

107
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,450
Today's guest was Detective Kogoro Mouri.

108
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,650
All right, then!

109
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,650
See all at the same time next week!

110
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,450
Great, okay!

111
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,550
That's all for today!

112
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,860
That's right!

113
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,060
You were great, Dad!

114
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,360
Really! It was a live broadcast

115
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,660
but you were so calm and just great!

116
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,170
No... It wasn't all that great.

117
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,570
Yoko, you're way too beautiful that the noodles have gotten too hot

118
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,040
and excited that the Yoko's Soy Sauce Ramen that I made,

119
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,550
as you can see, have become soggy and soft.

120
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,850
It's knocked out.

121
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,650
You're the one who's soft with women.

122
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,260
We're lucky though!

123
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,660
Since "Morning Live Seven" was filmed on a holiday,

124
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,360
we got to come and watch the program being shot live!

125
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,860
Yep.

126
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,770
Come to think of it, we didn't have breakfast yet.

127
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,970
If it's okay with you,

128
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,470
why don't we have breakfast at the restaurant at this TV station?

129
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,080
That sounds good!

130
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,740
Then, please go ahead and wait for me there!

131
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,050
I have someone I want you to meet, Mr. Mouri.

132
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,050
So I'll make a call now.

133
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,260
Sorry for the call, this is Okino. Were you sleeping?

134
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,860
What's the matter, Conan?

135
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,670
No, it's nothing.

136
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,270
This is bad.

137
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,370
Whenever I see somebody using the cell phone,

138
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,970
it immediately brings back memories of Vermouth.

139
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,440
The e-mail address of the of the boss of the Black Organization

140
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,250
who shrunk my body with a drug.

141
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,050
That melody, "Seven Kids"...

142
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,860
That e-mail address is one that you should never open

143
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,660
since it's Pandora's box.

144
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,760
Yes... I know.

145
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,260
Really?

146
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,870
Maybe I should've made Japanese omelette rice.

147
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,870
Mr. Mouri!

148
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,470
Thank you for waiting!

149
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,670
Yes...

150
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,640
Huh? If I remember correctly,

151
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,250
you're usually sitting on the side of the screen

152
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,150
on the "Sunday Night News".

153
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,350
Yes! She's Announcer, Rena Mizunashi!

154
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,850
Nice meeting you.

155
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,460
I'm the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri!

156
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,260
I'm his daughter, Ran.

157
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,760
This is Conan.

158
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,170
Hello!

159
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,670
Pleased to meet you.

160
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,970
Come on!

161
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,970
Hey, Yoko?

162
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,380
Are you serious about discussing something like that

163
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,250
to a famed detective?

164
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,650
Don't worry!

165
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will be able to work something out!

166
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,950
But...

167
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,650
Is something bothering you?

168
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,060
Yes.

169
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,160
Come on, Yoko...

170
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,860
Ring... Ring the bell and run away?

171
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,160
Are you asking me to catch the one who is doing that for you?

172
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,370
See... It's rude to ask him something like that, after all!

173
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,570
But it doesn't seem to be just a simple prank.

174
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,070
What do you mean?

175
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,270
Well...

176
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,440
The person rings the bell only early in the morning on Saturdays.

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,150
I was waiting again today in hopes of finding out who was doing it

178
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,750
but when I opened the door...

179
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,550
as soon as I heard the doorbell rang,

180
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,060
there was no one in sight anywhere.

181
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,860
-No way! -I've been afraid to open the door since then.

182
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,070
You mean it happened where you live?

183
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,670
Yes. At my condominium in Haido-cho.

184
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,770
If it's okay with you,

185
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,670
why don't you have Mr. Mouri go over to your place

186
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,380
and check things out?

187
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,950
I can't go because I have work after this but...

188
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,150
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

189
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,250
What?

190
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,760
There's nowhere for people to hide near the door.

191
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Yeah.

192
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,160
Why don't we try ringing the doorbell then?

193
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,670
Are you ready?

194
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,470
Then, I'm going to ring the doorbell.

195
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,950
Dad?

196
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,550
Are you all right?

197
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,650
Yes, sort of...

198
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,760
But now we know that there's practically no time to hide.

199
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,260
Yeah. Could you tell me more about it inside?

200
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,860
Sure. Please come in.

201
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,270
Sorry for intruding.

202
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,970
Let me get you slippers.

203
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,670
I don't need slippers. Thank you.

204
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,770
Of course, there're no slippers for kid!

205
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,680
Thank you!

206
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,540
This way, please.

207
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,950
Sorry for intruding.

208
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,050
You sure have a lot of locks, don't you?

209
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,160
Really. You got four locks all together.

210
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,760
Living alone as a woman could be a bit dangerous.

211
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Well, I guess so.

212
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,460
Would you like something to drink?

213
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,160
Coffee, please.

214
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,170
I'll help you!

215
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,270
Okay!

216
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,470
I guess I'll set a wiretap to pick up the sound at the front entrance

217
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,940
when the doorbell rings.

218
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,550
I'll set it up on the wall outside the door.

219
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,950
If I put it here, I can easily retrieve it later.

220
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,860
Just in case it peels off and gets lost,

221
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,960
I'll wrap this transmitter in the chewing gum too.

222
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,870
Okay, all set!

223
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,870
Just now...

224
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,240
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

225
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,950
Conan?

226
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,650
Will juice be okay?

227
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,950
Oh, yep!

228
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,250
Is anything the matter?

229
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,350
No, it's nothing.

230
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,760
Okay then, juice for you.

231
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,960
Is it just my imagination?

232
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,060
Or...

233
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,970
So somebody's been ringing your doorbell from two months ago.

234
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,750
Yes. It happens every Saturday at around 6:30 am since then.

235
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,350
Did something happen two months ago?

236
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,950
The only thing I remember is that,

237
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,850
I was shifted from the program "Morning Live Seven"

238
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,660
to "Sunday Night News".

239
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,360
Although I'm not the main announcer for either program.

240
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,160
You got to know Ms. Yoko doing "Morning Live Seven", then?

241
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,170
Yes. We were both working the program

242
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,270
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

243
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,670
If so, the prank could've started being played on you

244
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,270
since two months ago.

245
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,640
Yes. Because when I was still doing "Morning Live seven",

246
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,250
I used to leave for work at 4 am on Saturday.

247
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,950
Is the prank being played on you throughout the two months?

248
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,550
It is. Every Saturday.

249
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,350
Oh! But there was just one time that nothing happened.

250
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,960
I was abroad the week before last from Monday to Friday to cover news.

251
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,070
On the Saturday, a day after I came home, nothing happened.

252
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,370
It could be that I was tired and couldn't hear the doorbell, though.

253
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,470
And on the Tuesday after the three day holiday in October,

254
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,980
the same prank was played.

255
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,250
That was the only day the prank was played on Tuesday, though.

256
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,150
And just once there was something weird outside the door.

257
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,050
Something weird?

258
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,260
A bottle with some drug inside was found outside the door.

259
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,860
I had a doctor acquaintance check it after that

260
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,260
and found out that it was a sleeping drug.

261
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,060
Sleeping drug?

262
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,970
It's a stalker.

263
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,770
It's probably a warning that he's planning to put you to sleep

264
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,270
and do evil things to you.

265
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,470
No way.

266
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,570
Did you notice anything else left by the door?

267
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,580
Besides the sleeping drug.

268
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,240
Something else?

269
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,250
What is it?

270
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,750
Around three nights ago,

271
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,650
it seems that someone was in the house next door

272
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,550
that is supposedly vacant.

273
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,750
What?

274
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,660
Three nights ago is Tuesday, right?

275
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,260
Yes. At a little before midnight,

276
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,960
I finished taking a bath and was relaxing on the bed.

277
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,040
I thought next door was supposed to be vacant

278
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,850
so I take a look from the veranda.

279
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,950
It was pitch dark next door,

280
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,860
so I thought that the sound came from outside.

281
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,970
So I called the management company in the morning

282
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,870
but I was told, "You must've been dreaming".

283
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,340
There's a high chance that the man is a stalker.

284
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,050
That man had the spare key to the house next door.

285
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,050
Not only three nights ago,

286
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,260
but especially on Friday nights he slept in the house next door.

287
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,860
And the following day, he rang your doorbell.

288
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,860
I see. If it's the house next door,

289
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,060
he can hide right after ringing the doorbell.

290
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,970
That's why you couldn't find the culprit.

291
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,470
Since when was the house next door vacant?

292
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,640
Probably from about six months ago, I think.

293
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,750
Just as I thought, it's locked.

294
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,460
We may be able to get clues on the man if we go inside.

295
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,060
Why don't we call the management company and have them open the door?

296
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,260
But from the feeling I got last time,

297
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
I don't think that they'll help at all.

298
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,050
No good.

299
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,350
"Ki-Mi-Wa"

300
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,050
"Ki-Mi-Wa"?

301
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,040
"Ki-Bi-Wa".

302
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,350
What's this supposed to mean?

303
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,950
I wonder what "Ki-Bi-Wa" means?

304
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,950
"Bi"?

305
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,950
What? I wonder why I read the kanji character as "Mi"?

306
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,450
"Ki-Bi-Wa".

307
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,760
Thursday. (Same kanji character as Thursday)

308
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,860
Beauty. (Same kanji character as beauty)

309
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,060
Japanese cuisine. (Same kanji character as Japanese cuisine)

310
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,660
What is it?

311
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,760
Ms. Rena.

312
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,970
Haven't you done a TV program having key words like those?

313
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,240
No.

314
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,140
Rather, maybe it's somebody's name?

315
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Somebody's...

316
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,540
Somebody's name?

317
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,550
Yes, First Investigation Division.

318
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,350
Megure speaking...

319
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,650
Conan!

320
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,150
Yeah. I think he's here.

321
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,660
Hold on a second.

322
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,760
Let's see, the hold button...

323
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,660
So, that's the story.

324
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,160
Takagi, your extension is ringing.

325
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,660
Yeah.

326
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,860
Yes! Takagi here.

327
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,870
Officer Takagi!

328
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,070
What?

329
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,640
Inspector, didn't I teach you already?

330
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,740
About extension number...

331
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,040
Well, no big deal!

332
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,940
Oh yeah. Never mind that. Officer Takagi, from Conan on number one.

333
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,550
What? From Conan?

334
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,550
I wonder what he wants.

335
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,250
From Conan?

336
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,150
Yes. This is Takagi.

337
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,150
Oh, Officer Takagi?

338
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,260
There's something I'd like to ask you.

339
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,860
Three nights ago,

340
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,660
didn't you go inside unit 305 of a condominium Haido-cho?

341
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,060
Yeah.

342
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,830
I did.

343
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,840
The reason?

344
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,140
So, this vehicle was under...

345
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,640
I can't really tell you why...

346
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,140
Were you by any chance, Officer Takagi,

347
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,050
on a stake out the house of the condominium the other side?

348
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,050
-What? -What?

349
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,250
What?

350
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,050
Is anything the matter?

351
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,350
No, not really. It's nothing.

352
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,560
I wonder what's going on.

353
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,860
To be honest with you, that's right.

354
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,260
I stake out in the condominium unit

355
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,060
where I can see the house across from the window.

356
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,070
The ex-fiancee of a crime suspect lives in that condominium

357
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,140
and since there is a possibility of that suspect making contact with her,

358
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,440
we got permission from the management company and were staking out.

359
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,840
Just as I thought.

360
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,940
Just as you thought?

361
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,550
In the end, the suspect was arrested in Toriya-cho.

362
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,350
The stake out was cancelled at around midnight.

363
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,850
But since we're still investigating on the case

364
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,860
so the management company was told not to say anything.

365
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,560
And yet, how did you know I was staking out?

366
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,160
Officer Takagi.

367
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,770
While you're staking out,

368
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,840
didn't you doodle on the glass door?

369
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,040
You wrote "Miwako Takagi".

370
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
What is it, Officer Takagi?

371
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,240
Officer Takagi.

372
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,450
What's with him?

373
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,650
-I'm sorry! -He sure is acting jittery.

374
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,250
Conan, please don't tell her about this.

375
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,450
Okay?

376
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,760
Okay. I understand.

377
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,260
But Ran and Pops are here too!

378
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,370
No way!

379
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,270
Takagi!

380
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,040
Which means that while Officer Takagi

381
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,540
were staking out the ex-fiance of the suspect,

382
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,540
he was reminded of Officer Sato.

383
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,240
And as he was fantasizing marrying her,

384
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,950
he wrote that name on the glass door.

385
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,750
Right after that, he got a call from Inspector Megure

386
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,860
telling him that the suspect was caught.

387
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,460
As he left in a hurry,

388
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,960
so he forgot to erase the name on the glass door.

389
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,160
I see!

390
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,870
So as three days went by, the first two words of his last name

391
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,230
and the last word of Officer Sato's first name disappeared.

392
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,940
Come on. What a nuisance!

393
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,440
I'm sorry!

394
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,140
But it's just like him and kind of nice.

395
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,950
Really. That's so much unlike an officer and sort of cute.

396
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,050
I know, right?

397
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,350
But now we're back to where we started.

398
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,050
Yes..

399
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,560
And tomorrow is already the Saturday in question.

400
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,960
The only thing we can do now is to arrest the culprit in the act.

401
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,670
Ms. Rena!

402
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,540
Yes?

403
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Please let us spend the night here today!

404
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:22,840
I, Kogoro Mouri, will nab that lowly and dirty guy tomorrow!

405
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,260
Shall I help you clean up?

406
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,560
Don't worry about it.

407
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,760
Tomorrow is recyclable trash day.

408
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,060
So all I'm doing is getting together magazines and newspapers

409
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,270
and tying them together.

410
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,940
I'm required read a lot of newspapers and magazines on the job so...

411
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,540
You're cleaning up?

412
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,640
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

413
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,350
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

414
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,850
How nostalgic.

415
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,250
I read it during my junior high school days and was really scared.

416
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,960
Conan, do you know this story?

417
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Yep...

418
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,160
Dr. Henry Jekyll, who has a peaceful personality,

419
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,660
drinks the drug that he invented

420
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,670
and becomes Mr. Edward Hyde, a man with an evil personality.

421
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,030
A story about dual personality, right?

422
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,840
You really know a lot.

423
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,640
You brat!

424
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,040
This brat knows a lot about weird things.

425
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm really sorry.

426
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,260
Not at all.

427
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,460
Here.

428
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,360
Do you always leave it out here?

429
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
Yes.

430
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,270
If I leave it out here,

431
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,240
I can take them out as I go out in the morning.

432
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I see.

433
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,640
Besides, this is a corner unit,

434
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,440
so it won't get in anyone's way if it's just for a night.

435
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,150
Is Tuesday also a trash day?

436
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,650
Yes. For combustible trash.

437
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,050
I leave the trash for Tuesday out here on the day before too.

438
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,550
I see.

439
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,760
So that's the story.

440
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,660
Hey. Even if we figure out who the culprit is,

441
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,160
will you promise not to get too angry?

442
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,170
I'm sure he's a great fan of yours!

443
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm sure he is!

444
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,340
After all, he's a stalker.

445
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,800
Wake up, Pops.

446
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
Pops!

447
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,710
Pops. It's almost time.

448
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,810
Here it comes?

449
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,910
Please stay where you are, Ms. Rena!

450
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,380
Just you wait!

451
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,880
You rat.

452
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,890
I'm going to nab you right now.

453
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,390
And teach you a lesson!

454
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,590
What?

455
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,490
Dad?

456
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,600
Nobody's here.

457
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
No way!

458
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,300
You gotta be kidding?

459
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,800
How can it be?

460
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,810
I don't believe it!

461
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,210
It can't be! How?

462
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,710
How's it possible, Dad?

463
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,610
How should I know?

464
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,680
Right here.

465
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,180
He's here.

466
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,590
You said he's there?

467
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,390
Those are magazines!

468
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,090
Conan...

469
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,090
I mean, behind here.

470
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,300
Idiot! How can an adult be hiding in a place like that?

471
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
A...

472
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,800
A child?

473
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,300
You brat!

474
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,310
Was it you?

475
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,610
So you're the one who's been pushing the doorbell and running away!

476
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,110
I see! He wasn't found because he was a child.

477
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,180
I didn't think that someone would be hiding in a place like that.

478
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,890
I see.

479
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,090
You didn't do anything the Saturday the week before last week

480
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,990
because there were no stacks of magazines in front of the door, right?

481
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,900
That week Ms. Rena was out on a business trip and wasn't home,

482
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,100
and probably didn't have that many magazines to recycle!

483
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Hey, what were you doing?

484
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,600
Why did you do what you did for?

485
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
You're an elementary school student, aren't you?

486
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,510
Well, if you don't want to tell us about it, it can't be helped.

487
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,310
Let's go to the police, your parents and all

488
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,380
and get a good teaching there.

489
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,590
I think he rung the doorbell to wake her up.

490
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,590
So that Rena would make it in time for "Morning Live Seven".

491
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,100
I'm sure he thought that Ms. Rena isn't on "Morning Live Seven"

492
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,600
because she can't get up in the morning.

493
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,400
That's why he used to ring the doorbell at 6:30 am on Saturdays!

494
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,510
Since there's no school on Saturdays,

495
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,310
if he rushes home right after he rings the doorbell,

496
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,010
he can also confirm whether she's on the program or not!

497
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,780
But somebody pushed the doorbell on just one Tuesday too, right?

498
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,490
Don't tell me that you skipped school and...

499
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,590
I think there was no school.

500
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,090
There are consecutive days off in October, that is, the second Monday

501
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,390
because it's sports day.

502
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,300
If field day is held on that Monday,

503
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,400
usually, there is no school for grade school kids

504
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,100
on the following Tuesday.

505
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,910
Which means that he placed the sleeping pills there,

506
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,610
so Rena could sleep well and get up early in the morning.

507
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,710
Yep.

508
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,110
Because mother used to drink it saying she could sleep very well.

509
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,410
I see.

510
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,590
But why?

511
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,590
Why do you do so much for me?

512
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,600
Because you look like her.

513
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,100
You look like my mother.

514
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,310
My mother died last year of a traffic accident.

515
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,410
What?

516
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,510
That's why...

517
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,610
Sonny.

518
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,790
I understand that you're lonely because your mother's gone.

519
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,390
But if you keep clinging onto to your mother,

520
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,690
you'll only worry your mother who is in the heaven.

521
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,190
You're a boy,

522
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,500
so you got to be strong and let your mother rest in peace.

523
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
So, you shouldn't come here anymore.

524
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
For your mother's sake.

525
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,100
For your own sake too.

526
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,010
Understand?

527
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,810
Yep.

528
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,810
Bye, miss!

529
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,780
Bye.

530
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,990
It just...

531
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,800
I had a little brother about his age too back then.

532
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,300
Rather than that,

533
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,610
I have to pay you for detective fees.

534
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,110
Oh, no need for that!

535
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,810
We had dinner here too.

536
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,210
But...

537
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,910
Let me pay you at least as a token of my appreciation.

538
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,980
Oh, really?

539
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,090
Then I'll mail my bank account number to you later.

540
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,590
So can you give me your email address?

541
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,390
Hey...

542
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,790
Geez...

543
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,000
What a stale case it was...

544
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
But I'm glad that it turned out well.

545
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,100
It wasn't a weird stalker or anything.

546
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
Rain.

547
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,000
This is bad. I didn't retrieve the transmitter!

548
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
What's wrong, Conan?

549
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,710
I seem to have forgot something in Ms. Rena's house earlier.

550
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,710
What? Seriously.

551
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,310
Dad, you can go on ahead.

552
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,310
I'll go with Conan.

553
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,010
I'll go get it right away.

554
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,580
What? Conan.

555
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,890
Then we'll be waiting for you in the parking lot then!

556
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,290
Footsteps? Which means that...

557
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,100
Ms. Mizunashi stepped on it.

558
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,600
The sound of a cell phone being switched on.

559
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,980
"Seven Kids"!

560
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,390
Don't tell me...

561
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,190
Don't tell me that she...

562
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,900
Yes.

563
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

564
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,300
I had a bit of a problem and had my cell phone switched off.

565
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,600
It's all right.

566
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,710
It was no big thing.

567
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,110
I reported it to the person concerned by e-mail just now.

568
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,010
Don't tell me...

569
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,580
Yes. No problem.

570
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,780
Let's meet as we were scheduled to at 10 am.

571
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,590
Gin.

572
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,590
What?

573
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,590
Why?

574
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,460
What?

575
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,660
What did you just say?

576
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,460
Are you serious, Shinichi?

577
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,760
Yeah. No doubt about it!

578
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,370
I found a member of the Black Organization

579
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,970
after a chain of unusually coincidental events!

580
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,240
This is bad. The movement of the transmitter's becoming faster!

581
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
She's using a car.

582
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,350
Dr. Agasa! Rush over here!

583
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,050
Come pick me up with your Beetle!

584
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,050
Make sure that Haibara doesn't find out about this.

585
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,950
What?

586
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,750
Okay...

587
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,360
And Shinichi.

588
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,660
Yeah. I'm at Haido-cho's...

589
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,340
You're not getting away!

590
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,550
Conan?

591
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,450
Did you find what you were looking for?

592
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,650
What? What's up?

593
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,060
Conan says that he coincidentally ran into Dr. Agasa

594
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,260
and they're heading off to Tropical Land from now.

595
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,460
Come off it... It's raining.

596
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,260
What's with those two?

597
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,370
I'll call you again when I'm ready to go home!

598
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,470
Hey, wait...

599
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,850
I see...

600
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,050
You coincidentally became acquainted with an announcer,

601
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,360
who asked you to take on a job and went to her condominium,

602
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,960
where for investigation purposes,

603
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,460
you used chewing gum to stick on a transmitter and wiretap to the wall.

604
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,170
But the chewing gum came off and stuck to the sole of her shoe.

605
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,270
And that woman, again for some reason,

606
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,070
coincidentally turns out to be one of them.

607
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,340
Is that right?

608
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,140
Hey, Dr. Agasa?

609
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,840
I thought I told you not to bring her along!

610
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,550
Well, but you see...

611
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,150
So? Are you sure that

612
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,660
the announcer called Rena Mizunashi is one of them?

613
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah. She was sending mail to the mail address of their boss.

614
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
She also addressed the one who called her after that as...

615
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,260
Gin!

616
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,370
So, you see!

617
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,670
But you're sure lucky.

618
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,940
You got a clue to who they are thanks to a string of coincidences.

619
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,640
Rather, it's just the opposite.

620
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,740
It's the opposite. Really bad.

621
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,250
Think about it carefully.

622
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,650
If the transmitter and wiretap are found by them,

623
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,750
they'll naturally try to figure out who set it up.

624
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,150
And, the first person to be suspected would be the one

625
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,860
who was at that announcer's place until just a while ago,

626
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,960
Detective Kogoro Mouri!

627
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,860
Hey, don't tell me that...

628
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,960
Yeah.

629
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,370
Even if Pops were to have set them up

630
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,270
to investigate the case she asked him to take on.

631
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,940
The chance that he may have heard their conversation cannot be denied.

632
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,440
If this happens, those guys would most likely...

633
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,250
Get to work trying to shut him up.

634
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,150
Not only Kogoro Mouri.

635
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,550
But if need be, every single person around him.

636
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,960
No way...

637
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,360
In other words, the more information comes through the transmitter,

638
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,570
the more the necks of both Pops and I are being choked.

639
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,370
Then, we have to retrieve them

640
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,570
as soon as possible before those guys find them.

641
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,940
But I just don't get it.

642
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,740
That announcer asked Detective Mouri

643
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,650
to nab the one who was ringing her doorbell and running away, right?

644
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,350
Moreover, the culprit turned out to be a kid.

645
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,150
If she were one of them, she would never...

646
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,250
Yeah.

647
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,450
That's the part that bugs me too.

648
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,660
The movement of the transmitter has slowed down.

649
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,340
Besides the sound of the engine is echoing.

650
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,540
Which means...

651
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,840
She went into an indoor parking lot somewhere.

652
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,550
Which means that she'll be meeting those guys in that building somewhere.

653
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,750
She's approaching something...

654
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,850
Is it a car?

655
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,660
This unique uneven sound of idling...

656
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,670
And...

657
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,240
The sound of the engine revving is that of a horizontally opposed engine.

658
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,640
Hey, don't tell me that...

659
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,940
Yeah...

660
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
The only cars equipped with this engine

661
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,340
are either Volkswagens, Subaru or...

662
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,950
that guy's beloved vehicle.

663
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,050
Porsche. That's all.

664
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,970
What's up, Kir?

665
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,740
You promised to be here at 10 am.

666
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,040
Gin!

667
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,540
I'm sorry.

668
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,850
A car seems to have been tailing me

669
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,050
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

670
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,350
Don't tell me that she's referring to our car?

671
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,760
No, because we kept more than 600 m away from her car.

672
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,360
It couldn't be us.

673
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,560
Are you sure you're not in trouble?

674
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,060
Yes. I was just being too overly concerned.

675
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,870
So, will you put that Beretta that you're aiming out the window

676
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,570
back into it's case?

677
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,240
If you shoot me because you don't trust me...

678
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
You won't be able to kill DJ, right?

679
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,050
DJ...

680
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,050
What does that mean?

681
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,850
Okay.

682
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:18,750
We have 500 m of all the four directions of this building covered.

683
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,060
If an unwanted car approaches,

684
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,360
we'll know right of the bat.

685
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,460
Dr. Agasa.

686
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,560
Will you pull the car over slowly to the shoulder of the road.

687
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,570
What?

688
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,270
After stopping wear your hood and go outside.

689
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,270
Then, pretend that you're checking the car.

690
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,740
Quick!

691
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,840
Okay.

692
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,150
Here goes the final confirmation.

693
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,760
Go ahead.

694
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,160
Time is 13:00.

695
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,960
Place is Edie P...

696
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,270
I, as the interviewer, will guide DJ to the designated place.

697
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,470
Yes...

698
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,170
We'll be waiting for you, Kir.

699
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,240
Shove the prey right into the center of my scope

700
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,340
and excite me.

701
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,850
My, Chianti...

702
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,550
Korn's with you too, isn't he?

703
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,750
How encouraging.

704
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,550
Kir, Chianti, Korn.

705
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,060
How many of them are they, anyway?

706
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,460
I'm counting on you all.

707
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,860
Our achievements will never see the light.

708
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,970
But when we fail, the word goes around really quickly.

709
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:42,840
Whether we succeed or not, nobody will know about it.

710
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,340
That's how the organization works.

711
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,940
Yeah. That's right.

712
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,550
Okay. It's almost time.

713
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,350
Hurry and finish what you have to.

714
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,450
Will you work it out

715
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,450
so that I don't have to do anything?

716
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,560
Vermouth!

717
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,760
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

718
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,060
How come?

719
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,960
Why is this lady here?

720
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,460
Nobody told me!

721
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,870
How come this lady who took Calvados out on his own and left him to die

722
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,070
is included in this project!

723
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,870
Go back to the car, Chianti.

724
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,740
We're keeping her here just in case.

725
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,740
But...

726
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,650
This is his order too, you know?

727
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,560
The place is Edie P.

728
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,360
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

729
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
What?

730
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,170
What do you mean by that?

731
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,240
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

732
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
Yeah.

733
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,640
What's more of a problem is the rain.

734
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,250
Don't worry.

735
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:00,350
It'll clear up before noon. The weather forecast...

736
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,850
Darn it! It's raining so hard

737
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,460
that the sound's...

738
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,060
Haibara, do you know?

739
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,560
Who's DJ?

740
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,760
Where's this Edie P that they're talking about?

741
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,360
They mention about that just now!

742
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,170
It's a code or something, right?

743
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,070
Well...

744
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,070
I don't know who is DJ

745
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,870
but if Edie P is a place,

746
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,840
P probably stands for a parking lot or a park.

747
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,240
Then, do you know who Kir, Chianti and Korn are?

748
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,550
I don't remember Kir.

749
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,250
But I've heard of Chianti and Korn.

750
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,050
They're supposed to be competent snipers.

751
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,050
Which means that they're going to assassinate somebody after all.

752
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,760
Hey, what's going on?

753
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,960
Don't tell me that the two are there too?

754
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,260
Darn it, I don't have enough information.

755
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,960
I've to get closer!

756
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,170
The transmitter is 580 m northeast from here.

757
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,340
Probably at the basement parking of that building over there.

758
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,250
Haibara, wait here together with the Dr. Agasa!

759
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,750
Hey, just where do you think you're going?

760
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,850
Never mind that! Just wait here!

761
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,150
That's as far as you go.

762
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,040
Kudo!

763
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,240
Shinichi?

764
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,420
Hi!

765
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,420
Cool Kid.

766
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,530
Ms. Jodie?

767
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,130
Hi!

768
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
What brings you here?

769
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,540
We, FBI agents, have been tailing her.

770
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,410
Ever since Vermouth disguised as Dr. Araide,

771
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,810
that announcer, Rena Mizunashi,

772
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,520
has been frequenting his clinic.

773
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,220
But it really shocked me,

774
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,220
when we were staking her out and...

775
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,730
Detective Mouri went into her place.

776
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,830
Then...

777
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,240
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

778
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,040
That was...

779
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,740
Yes! That was me!

780
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,510
And I found out that she had asked Kogoro

781
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,410
to investigate the prank that was being played by the child.

782
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,020
Just when I thought she was innocent

783
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,720
and about to quit staking her out...

784
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,920
I saw you running with a dreadfully serious look on your face.

785
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,020
Cool kid?

786
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,730
I figured there had to be something going on.

787
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,830
So, I continued to pursue her.

788
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,840
I knew she was trying to throw me off track,

789
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,640
so I didn't gone all the way and dropped pursuing her altogether.

790
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,810
I see.

791
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,610
So the car she was referring to was...

792
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,220
I'm sorry.

793
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,520
A car seems to have been tailing me

794
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,320
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

795
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,320
The car she was talking about was Ms. Jodie's car.

796
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,930
You people lost track of her car too, didn't you?

797
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,630
Leave the rest to the F.B.I and go on home!

798
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,740
"You", you said? Do you mean you have a clue?

799
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,940
I can't give you the details,

800
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,840
but it seems she going to be interviewing three people today.

801
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,740
I'm thinking that maybe there is a person among the three,

802
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,310
who's being manipulated by them

803
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,810
and that some sort of transaction

804
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,620
or information exchange will be carried out.

805
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,720
No, it's no transaction!

806
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,020
Those guys are planning to kill one of the three

807
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,520
at 1 pm in the afternoon today!

808
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,930
What?

809
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,530
How do you know?

810
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,430
The transmitter coincidentally got stuck to the sole of her shoe.

811
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,930
So I've been pursuing her with my pursuit glasses...

812
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,340
This is bad! It's coming closer!

813
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,240
-Get in! -What?

814
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,440
Dr. Agasa, you too! Get in quickly!

815
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,940
Yeah.

816
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,320
Jodie here.

817
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,220
Our target is heading southward on Toriyakaido!

818
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,420
Please pursue.

819
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,730
Gin's car is taking a different route...

820
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,030
Are we pursuing them too?

821
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:34,930
No. All we'll end up doing just pursuing them blindly is go in circles.

822
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,940
Besides, we're finished if they find out that we're tailing them

823
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,740
But we have to do something or someone's going to be killed, right?

824
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,740
In other words, we have no choice

825
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,340
but to figure out who DJ is

826
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,610
and figure out the place called Edie P

827
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,520
and get to both before they do.

828
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,820
Yeah.

829
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,520
So, will you tell me in detail

830
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,020
about the three people

831
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,820
that the announcer is scheduled to interview today?

832
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,930
The three people she'll be interviewing are

833
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,030
the candidates who are running for the House of Representatives

834
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,830
for the first time.

835
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,630
The first person is a professor

836
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,030
of the pharmaceutical department of Teito University,

837
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:13,940
who has researched and developed many new drugs, Eisaku Tokiwa.

838
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,440
The second person is a famous actor from a distinguished family.

839
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,040
Moreover, if he wins, he will be a second generation Dietman.

840
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,710
Junji Sendou.

841
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,520
The third person is the son of the former official of the Defense Agency,

842
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,820
who he himself served as a higher up in the Self Defense Force,

843
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,520
Yasuteru Domon.

844
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,720
But we weren't able to get information on what time,

845
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,030
where and who she would be interviewing.

846
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,630
We were told that it was all up to her and the TV crew.

847
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:42,930
Maybe she's going to be holding a no appointment interview.

848
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,940
If so, high chances that the TV crew is also one of them.

849
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,840
But all three of them do not have the initials DJ.

850
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,010
Eisaku Tokiwa is ET.

851
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,520
Junji Sendou is JS.

852
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,320
Yasuteru Domon is YD.

853
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,420
If we can at least figure out the place.

854
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,930
There are so many parking lots and parks.

855
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,230
DJ usually stands for Disc Jockey, doesn't it?

856
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,030
The etymology is disc...

857
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,540
In other words, records are changed one after the other

858
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,440
to play a variety of songs.

859
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,140
This was deemed analogous to one riding records,

860
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,540
that is, to a jockey who rides horses

861
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,010
We have no information that any of the three

862
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,620
is into music or hooked on gambling either.

863
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,720
Gambling?

864
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,020
What's on your mind?

865
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,620
It's about time that...

866
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,220
Gambling.

867
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,530
It's about time that we go after her

868
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,830
or we'll really lose track of her...

869
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:50,130
No. We're not pursuing her.

870
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,640
Let's call the election offices.

871
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,740
And ask what the candidate is scheduled to do around 13:00.

872
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,340
Don't tell me that you figured something out?

873
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:05,920
Yeah. One of the three is their target DJ!

874
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,420
The clue is the Jack of Diamonds.

875
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,220
The Jack of Diamonds?

876
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,630
Are you saying that's what DJ stands for?

877
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,630
Yeah.

878
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:23,730
They always referred to their targets using playing cards!

879
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,840
If so, diamonds symbolize material possessions and financial wealth.

880
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,540
DJ is comes from a rich, distinguished family

881
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,540
and will become a second generation Dietman if elected...

882
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,410
He's Junji Sendou.

883
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,610
Wrong.

884
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,310
In playing cards, The Jack of Diamonds symbolizes

885
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,720
the one who serves the Court,

886
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,520
either a retainer or a soldier who has be appointed as an official.

887
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,920
It doesn't have the meaning of Prince or son.

888
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
What?

889
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,120
But...

890
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,730
He's the only rich one around.

891
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,330
It's true that diamonds symbolize money,

892
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,930
But in astrology it symbolizes other qualities.

893
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:58,240
In other words, a former self defense executive,

894
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,240
with a name that describes the character Earth in his name, which means

895
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,540
Yasuteru Domon.

896
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,640
He's their target!

897
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,710
Yasuteru Domon.

898
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,910
He has a strong sense of justice

899
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,420
and made repeated radical comments regarding violence

900
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,720
and crimes on TV and in the papers.

901
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,920
He also has a great number of supporters.

902
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,030
Therefore, he had snipers being sent out after him

903
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,130
by crime related organizations,

904
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,930
but he's a super tough guy who beat them all up instead.

905
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:31,540
It seems that he doesn't need us to protect him though.

906
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,240
No. The one who is after him is The Black Organization.

907
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,940
They can't be taken lightly.

908
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,840
I got it.

909
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,610
The telephone number to his election campaign office.

910
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:47,020
It says on the website that he is scheduled to play golf this afternoon

911
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,620
but it doesn't say where.

912
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,020
So, the parking lot of the golf range

913
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,930
is where Mr. Domon is going to be shot.

914
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,930
At any rate, I think it's fastest to call this office and ask.

915
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,330
Here.

916
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,130
Ms. Jodie, here's the number.

917
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,340
Okay!

918
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,540
There. Okay.

919
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,610
What?

920
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,620
No. I just thought you changed.

921
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,720
What?

922
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,320
Because when any of them were involved before,

923
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,520
"Stop it!"

924
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,520
"It's dangerous!"

925
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,320
"You'd better run!"

926
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,730
That's all you used to say!

927
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,230
Most naturally.

928
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:35,330
This time the transmitter and wiretap that you carelessly set up

929
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:40,040
is stuck on the sole of the shoe of one of the members.

930
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,640
If they find the devices,

931
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,840
not only you, but all the people around you,

932
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,940
in other words, all of us as well may be dunked into hot water.

933
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,310
That's true, but...

934
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,720
Besides...

935
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,920
I...

936
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,720
I'll go see him after all.

937
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,820
If I see the culprit close by, I may be able to recognize him.

938
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,330
No! I already explained to you that

939
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,430
if the culprit is not caught,

940
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,130
there's a possibility that you'll get into big trouble.

941
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,230
But...

942
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,140
Not only you,

943
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,640
but there is a possibility that all the people who helped you

944
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,440
will end up being their target.

945
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,610
I understand your feeling of wanting to punish evil.

946
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,510
But to hold yourself back,

947
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,820
endure and back off is also a type of courage.

948
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,820
But...

949
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,520
But I...

950
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,220
I don't want to run!

951
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,730
I can never win if I keep on running away!

952
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,230
Never!

953
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,930
Besides... What?

954
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,470
What? You don't know?

955
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,670
What do you mean?

956
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,470
Wasn't he scheduled to go golfing?

957
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:11,670
Well.

958
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,670
He cancelled it yesterday.

959
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,180
Something about he suddenly promised to meet someone.

960
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,880
Then, contact him quickly!

961
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,680
And tell him not to meet anyone

962
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,380
because his life is in danger!

963
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,190
We get a lot of calls like yours.

964
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,690
But no need to worry.

965
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:34,290
Mr. Domon is strong and he has two bodyguards accompanying him.

966
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,990
Please don't worry.

967
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,300
Please excuse me because I've other things to attend to.

968
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,000
Hey, wait!

969
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,170
It seems he took your call to be a prank.

970
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:46,470
-No way! -Well, it really can't be helped, though...

971
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,770
Darn it.

972
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:53,380
We've to locate Edie P which is the other hint we have.

973
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:57,880
That announcer who's supposed to be interviewing Mr. Domon.

974
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,580
Where is she now?

975
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,590
About 18 km southeast from here.

976
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,890
That's just around Nichiuri TV station in Shiodome.

977
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,400
She's probably going to join the crew there and go with them.

978
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,170
A phone call?

979
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,870
What's up?

980
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,870
Just confirming.

981
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,480
I have a very wary and persistent personality.

982
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,980
Don't worry.

983
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,880
Everything's fine.

984
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,280
I'm going to join the crew

985
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,490
and head for Edie P on the TV station wagon now.

986
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,190
The rain has cleared.

987
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,390
And it's turned out to be a great day for hunting.

988
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:40,790
Kir.

989
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,590
I've been thinking from this morning,

990
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:46,000
Your phone's very static.

991
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,270
Yeah. Maybe because I'm in the basement?

992
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,370
I answered the phone in the basement this morning too.

993
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,970
Okay, Gin.

994
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,970
We'll go on ahead then!

995
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,380
Hey, Chianti!

996
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,880
Good luck.

997
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,690
I'll kill her!

998
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,390
I'll kill!

999
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,090
I'll kill her for sure!

1000
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,500
I hate Vermouth too.

1001
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Calvados used to love her.

1002
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,870
She used him to her advantage.

1003
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,470
That's why I hate her.

1004
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,670
Yes. I would've killed her long ago if I had my way.

1005
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,980
And that woman was not our boss' favorite.

1006
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,790
Darn it!

1007
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,990
We have less than 30 minutes to go

1008
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:48,190
before the assassination time that they mentioned!

1009
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,200
Edie P...

1010
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,600
Where on earth is it?

1011
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,070
Edie P!

1012
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:59,570
I think we should head over to the TV station too, don't you?

1013
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,170
Yes, I agree.

1014
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,780
We're not getting anywhere wasting our time here.

1015
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,180
Even if we were to locate their hunting ground.

1016
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,780
If we're too far away from the TV station wagon,

1017
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,380
we can't possibly beat them to it.

1018
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,390
Hunting ground.

1019
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,790
Come to think of it, Vermouth was saying.

1020
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:26,700
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

1021
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,270
What? What do you mean?

1022
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,770
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

1023
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,580
History.

1024
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,880
Oh, a phone call?

1025
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,980
It's mine.

1026
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,480
Well...

1027
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,080
This sound is...

1028
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,680
Conan's cell phone.

1029
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,890
Hello?

1030
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,590
What do you mean, hello?

1031
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,690
Gosh. How dare you hang up on me like that?

1032
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:58,000
I'm sorry, Ran.

1033
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,300
If this horse comes, it'll be a big win!

1034
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,670
Please put Dr. Agasa on the phone!

1035
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,370
It's already our turn to ride the Ferris Wheel!

1036
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,870
So I'll call you again later!

1037
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,970
Hey, Conan!

1038
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,670
Geez!

1039
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,580
Oh, cool kid!

1040
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,580
It's like you have dual personality!

1041
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,380
Dual personality?

1042
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,680
Wait a second.

1043
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,880
Hunting ground.

1044
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,080
History.

1045
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,390
Park.

1046
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:22,790
Dual personality!

1047
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,790
You're cleaning up?

1048
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,890
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

1049
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,600
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

1050
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,700
How nostalgic.

1051
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,170
I see! Dr. Agasa!

1052
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,270
Take a left at that traffic light over there and get on the freeway!

1053
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,970
The freeway?

1054
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,570
If we go on the freeway,

1055
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:47,080
we'll be driving away from Nichiuri TV, you know?

1056
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,880
It's okay.

1057
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,580
Because we're beating them to the hunting ground.

1058
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,180
Beat them to it?

1059
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,690
Don't tell me that...

1060
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,990
Yeah.

1061
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,190
I finally figured it out!

1062
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:02,790
The location Edie P that they're planning to assassinate Mr. Domon is...

1063
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,200
Haido Park!

1064
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,900
Haido Park?

1065
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,570
But what makes you think Edie P is?

1066
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:14,770
It flashed upon me when Ms. Jodie said "dual personality" a while ago.

1067
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:19,080
That Eddie is the short form of Edward!

1068
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,180
I see.

1069
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,480
Edward Hyde.

1070
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,580
Edward is the first name of a character

1071
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,680
that appears in Stevenson's bizarre novel,

1072
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,990
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".

1073
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:32,990
Which means, Edie P stands for Haido Park!

1074
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:37,090
I'm sure there was a parking space in that park, though.

1075
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:38,200
No.

1076
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,570
They mentioned that there was no better place for hunting.

1077
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,570
In the real Hyde Park in London,

1078
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:48,770
until around the 16th Century, deer and wolves existed

1079
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,180
and it used to be the hunting ground of the nobles.

1080
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,180
That's the hunting ground!

1081
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,380
There's no mistake about it!

1082
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,480
This is bad.

1083
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,580
If we go as is, the TV station wagon will be there before us.

1084
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,690
Dr. Agasa! Hurry!

1085
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:02,990
Okay!

1086
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,500
Hey, Gin.

1087
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,770
Isn't Kir here yet?

1088
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,470
I'm dying of boredom.

1089
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:22,070
Hold it. She's on her way there while bringing DJ along with her.

1090
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:26,380
Don't you dare hunt some other prey to get rid of your boredom now.

1091
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,880
The same goes for Korn.

1092
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,790
That boy.

1093
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:46,400
And FBI agents!

1094
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,870
Why?

1095
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,970
Listen.

1096
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,770
Only Ms. Jodie and me are going!

1097
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,670
Both of you don't come out of the car, no matter what!

1098
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,870
Okay.

1099
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,870
Ms. Jodie!

1100
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,780
We don't have time!

1101
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,880
Where is it?

1102
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,490
Sorry for all the trouble.

1103
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:12,690
Thank you so very much for agreeing to our scoop interview.

1104
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,890
No problem. Anytime.

1105
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,190
Was this the place the interview is to be held?

1106
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,300
Yes.

1107
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,870
It's a wonderful park.

1108
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:24,070
It's my usual jogging course.

1109
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,170
Well, at that time, my two bodyguards here

1110
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:29,270
end up running with me though.

1111
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:31,680
I wonder what's taking her so long.

1112
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,280
Kir.

1113
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,380
By the way, about the, you know what...

1114
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,180
In place of my accepting this interview,

1115
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,490
you'll approve of the condition I set forth too, won't you?

1116
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:45,090
Yes. Of course.

1117
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,590
I appreciate it.

1118
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,290
Okay, Kir.

1119
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:53,500
Guide DJ to the designated place.

1120
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,670
This is going to be some heavy film.

1121
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,870
Too bad it's not live broadcast.

1122
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,770
90 m more!

1123
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,670
Please make it in time!

1124
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,880
We shouldn't just stand and talk.

1125
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,780
Let's go some place where we can relax and talk.

1126
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,980
True.

1127
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,780
Well...

1128
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,580
How about sitting on that bench over there?

1129
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,490
Bench?

1130
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,590
Great.

1131
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,090
Good. That's right.

1132
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:22,690
Let's get it over with as soon as possible, Mr. Domon.

1133
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,900
What? Isn't that Mr. Domon?

1134
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,000
What?

1135
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,570
Amazing, he's for real!

1136
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,370
Please shake hands with me!

1137
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,970
It's fine.

1138
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,170
I support you!

1139
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,070
Please change Japan!

1140
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:38,980
Oh, thank you!

1141
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,780
I got him.

1142
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,580
Can I shoot him?

1143
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,480
Not yet, Korn.

1144
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,390
There're too many sheep in the way.

1145
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,990
Wait until DJ sits down on the bench.

1146
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,600
There he is!

1147
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,270
Hey. Isn't he Mr. Domon that appears a lot on TV?

1148
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,370
For real?

1149
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,570
But where's the snipers?

1150
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,780
They were concerned about the rain.

1151
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,880
So they're probably...

1152
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,180
On the roof of a building!

1153
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,780
Over there?

1154
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,380
And the other one.

1155
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,590
It's under the water tank.

1156
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:24,390
I'll go save Mr. Domon.

1157
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,390
So you go ahead and take the others to a safe place.

1158
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,390
No.

1159
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,290
If I carelessly charge in there and he fires at random,

1160
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,000
he may hit the spectators in the area!

1161
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,870
In order to prevent them from shooting.

1162
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,570
In order to make them give the whole thing up.

1163
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,470
Umbrella?

1164
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,770
Well...

1165
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:45,180
Let's shake hands after the interview.

1166
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,380
How annoying.

1167
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,880
Hold your horses

1168
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,380
and wait.

1169
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,390
There!

1170
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,590
Sprinkler?

1171
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,690
Hey, Ms. Jodie.

1172
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,400
Do you have a gun?

1173
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,440
Mr.Domon!

1174
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,040
Thank you...

1175
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,540
A gun?

1176
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,010
Well, yes.

1177
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,610
What about a silencer?

1178
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:24,620
Yeah.

1179
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,320
Then, will you shoot what I tell to shoot at?

1180
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,320
But do it so no one notices!

1181
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,520
So, like I said, let's shake hands later.

1182
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,230
Mr. Domon!

1183
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:36,930
I support you!

1184
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,830
So please do your best!

1185
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,930
Yeah.

1186
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,430
Thank you!

1187
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Will films like this come in handy later during the election?

1188
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,640
Yes, of course.

1189
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,920
Understand, Korn?

1190
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,820
I shoot his head!

1191
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,120
And you shoot his back.

1192
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:11,230
I want to shoot his head.

1193
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,730
Okay! Suit yourself!

1194
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,740
What's up, Kir?

1195
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,840
Hurry and make DJ sit down!

1196
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,040
Kir?

1197
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,210
Mr. Domon?

1198
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,720
It's about time we get the interview going.

1199
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,020
Yes, I guess so.

1200
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,430
Excuse me.

1201
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,430
Will you all back off a bit?

1202
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,630
We'd like to film the interview.

1203
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,440
Sprinkler?

1204
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,510
Rain?

1205
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,030
Hey, come on. Give me a break.

1206
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,430
Seriously?

1207
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,640
Come on, and sit down.

1208
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,740
Quickly!

1209
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,940
Thanks.

1210
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,120
DJ has a navy blue umbrella.

1211
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,320
Can I shoot him?

1212
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,620
Wait.

1213
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,130
Shooting him through the umbrella will reduce accuracy.

1214
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:23,330
But how strange.

1215
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,430
It's not raining on this side.

1216
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,210
It's begun raining on this side too.

1217
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,020
It's really started raining.

1218
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,730
Blessed rain.

1219
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,740
Chianti.

1220
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,640
Kir, Korn.

1221
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,640
Withdraw for now!

1222
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,110
I'll be waiting for you at the place in an hour.

1223
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:18,520
Then...

1224
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,620
Will you tell me?

1225
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:27,220
The synopsis of the second part of the assassination scheme is?

1226
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,730
We have no choice.

1227
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,230
Let's continue the interview at the summerhouse within this park.

1228
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,230
Yes.

1229
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,730
Shall we get going then?

1230
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,540
Excuse me. May we go with you too?

1231
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,840
Yes, of course!

1232
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,940
-Then, me too! -Same here!

1233
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,320
Chance!

1234
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,620
-Hurry up... -Wait...

1235
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,820
I'd better get the transmitter and wiretap

1236
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,020
that on the sole of her shoe now!

1237
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,330
Okay! It's mine now!

1238
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,930
Sonny?

1239
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,240
I found it!

1240
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,230
Don't tell me that you followed me here?

1241
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,430
No. I didn't.

1242
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,130
It's just a coincidence.

1243
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,640
I see.

1244
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,540
Thank you.

1245
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,610
For picking my shoe up for me.

1246
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,030
Thank you very much.

1247
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,530
Director!

1248
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:20,340
Could you substitute someone in my place to hold the interview?

1249
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,340
-What? -I'm sorry.

1250
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,440
I'm having trouble with my shoe since earlier.

1251
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,240
Hey...

1252
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,330
Gin.

1253
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,340
The announcer found you?

1254
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,840
No way!

1255
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,840
Don't tell me she found out that we were tailing her.

1256
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,110
No, I think I pulled through okay on that one.

1257
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,220
She hasn't noticed the transmitter and wiretap either.

1258
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:09,220
Then, why didn't you retrieve them?

1259
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,420
All you had to do was tell her that

1260
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,220
something was on the back of her shoe and take them.

1261
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,730
Yeah. I thought of doing so too,

1262
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:20,230
but she...

1263
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,930
Thank you very much.

1264
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,240
I sort of felt strange.

1265
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:32,140
But thanks to you, we can pursue going after them!

1266
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:36,310
Besides, there seems to be more to their assassination scheme.

1267
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,610
Yeah.

1268
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,620
Is it okay to leave things as they are?

1269
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:45,420
The TV crew, that she brought along with her, are with him, aren't they?

1270
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,720
The crew aren't involved in this!

1271
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,230
She deliberately tried to find a reason

1272
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:53,130
for acting on her own without the crew.

1273
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,430
So my guess is...

1274
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,930
Those guys are probably going to get together somewhere.

1275
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,440
And get on with their next plan.

1276
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:04,540
Well, leave the rest to us, FBI agents,

1277
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,640
and you people get on going home with the Beetle.

1278
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,020
I'm going to keep him with me for a while, though!

1279
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,620
Then, how do you intend to pursue them without a car?

1280
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,220
No problem.

1281
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:25,230
My boss offered of his own initiative to be my driver.

1282
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,120
Then, Dr. Agasa.

1283
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,320
Smooth things out with Pops and Ran for me.

1284
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,130
Invite them over to your place and make sure they don't find out anything.

1285
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:57,530
Okay!

1286
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,830
Just to be on the safe side,

1287
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:02,230
we'll have two or three of our members stay on guard too.

1288
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,030
Then, I'm counting on you!

1289
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,840
Hey!

1290
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,540
I'm sure you already know.

1291
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:15,410
But your prime purpose is to retrieve the transmitter and wiretap!

1292
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,820
If you hesitate because of curiosity or a sense of justice,

1293
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,120
you may end up losing everything!

1294
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,420
Yeah, I know.

1295
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:36,630
You shot the sprinkler and broke it

1296
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,430
to make them think that it started to rain,

1297
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,330
and prevented those guys from going through with their plan

1298
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,730
by making the crowd as well as the target to use their umbrellas.

1299
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,310
It's no wonder you respect this boy.

1300
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:54,210
I'd like to scout him to the bureau myself.

1301
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:00,720
He's James!

1302
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,920
You've met him once before, haven't you?

1303
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,920
Conan.

1304
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,720
The last I saw you was that Panda car incident?

1305
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,630
You were a life saver then!

1306
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,830
Panda?

1307
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:14,330
What?

1308
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,430
It's true!

1309
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:17,630
James left behind for us.

1310
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:22,100
I'm telling you that the code "P&A" means police car!

1311
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,010
So, why does "P&A" mean police car?

1312
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:30,410
Try changing the "&" in "P&A" into the alphabet!

1313
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:32,110
Let's see.

1314
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:34,820
P&A.

1315
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,120
P and a, n, d and a.

1316
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,620
Panda?

1317
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,220
I see! Panda!

1318
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,530
I see.

1319
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,830
The color of a police car is black and white

1320
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,030
Hey! Hurry!

1321
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:50,130
Use the hostage as a shield and run for it!

1322
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,430
Okay!

1323
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:56,200
Help!

1324
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,610
What the...

1325
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,310
Officer!

1326
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:01,210
Please help us!

1327
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:06,720
Excuse me!

1328
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,420
I'm Officer Takagi from headquarters!

1329
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,520
Please help us arrest the kidnapper!

1330
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,020
Darn it, that almost scared me.

1331
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:17,930
Okay, after keeping them company for a while, take a side road!

1332
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:22,130
Okay, got them!

1333
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,630
Okay. It's about time we take a side road.

1334
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,800
If there's no road to the left, take the right!

1335
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,710
But...

1336
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:34,910
There's another police car to the right too!

1337
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,410
Then, reverse!

1338
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,310
Slow down and reverse.

1339
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,220
There's a police car behind too.

1340
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,320
What?

1341
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,120
Hey, we're completely...

1342
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,620
surrounded by cops!

1343
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:58,730
So, this James guy is also an FBI agent.

1344
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:04,810
But why are they going after Yasuteru Domon who's not even a Dietman?

1345
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,010
Probably because his father used to be a famous government official,

1346
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:09,610
he's well known in the world of politics.

1347
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,410
He's got charisma

1348
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:15,420
and is a solid clump of righteousness.

1349
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:19,320
Rumor already has it that he's a candidate for the future Prime Minister.

1350
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,420
I see.

1351
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,920
They want to get rid of anyone that is bound to resist against them

1352
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,930
while still a bud.

1353
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:29,030
That's how they work.

1354
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:31,130
Besides, if they kill him now,

1355
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:34,200
they can make it look like Kiriko Busujima did it.

1356
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,700
Kiriko Busujima?

1357
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:40,610
Yes. A woman executive of the Deisan Organization

1358
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:44,910
that is suspected of having sent out a sniper to kill him.

1359
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:46,410
I see.

1360
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,720
Take a left at the next intersection.

1361
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,620
Well? Anything from them?

1362
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,830
No. Still too early for anything.

1363
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,530
By the way,

1364
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,930
do you know where Shuichi is?

1365
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:09,400
Yeah. I'm looking for him too.

1366
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,410
You explained this to him, didn't you?

1367
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:13,610
Yes.

1368
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:17,410
Including info about the transmitter and wiretap that this boy set up.

1369
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:19,810
This is what he said over the phone.

1370
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,620
I see.

1371
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,320
That's it.

1372
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,920
I haven't heard a word from him since.

1373
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,730
Ever since he lost his girlfriend,

1374
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:35,330
it seems he's got a tendency to close up like a clam.

1375
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:38,630
Not that he had an open heart to begin with, though.

1376
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,300
I hear him.

1377
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,400
This voice is...

1378
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:50,510
At about 16:00, DJ will pass over and cross a bridge.

1379
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:53,010
That's where he's going to be assassinated.

1380
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,420
Gin!

1381
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:04,240
Chianti and Korn, you both go around to support this time.

1382
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,340
What? Support?

1383
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,840
I want to shoot.

1384
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,350
Well, think about it.

1385
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:14,350
He's riding a specially ordered bulletproof car.

1386
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,850
It's not the same as killing him in the park.

1387
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,350
But...

1388
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:21,460
Besides, he's tightly guarded on both sides by bodyguards

1389
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,960
who have been trained in the Self-Defense Force.

1390
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,830
The 7.62 mm bullet may pierce though the thinnest part of the car.

1391
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:31,930
Though the thinnest side window.

1392
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:34,740
But will not reach DJ.

1393
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:37,140
Then, how do you intend to kill him?

1394
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:41,540
Do you might me to stand on the bridge stark naked and hitchhike,

1395
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,950
then get myself in his car or something?

1396
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,950
My, Chianti. That's pretty good thinking.

1397
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,550
Vermouth?

1398
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,550
I'm going to ride this motorbike

1399
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,550
and fall right in front of DJ's car and stop him.

1400
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,960
When he comes out of the car,

1401
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,860
I'll come from behind

1402
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,630
and get him.

1403
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:06,630
The job of you both is to get rid of the two bodyguards

1404
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,040
that come out of the car together with DJ.

1405
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:15,840
But I wonder if that cautious man will come out of the car that easily.

1406
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,550
Don't worry.

1407
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,350
If a woman bleeds from her head

1408
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:23,750
after her helmet flies off and is lying on the ground.

1409
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,850
A man of justice such as he is will probably come dashing over, no?

1410
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,960
What?

1411
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,760
Cut out the joke!

1412
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,230
There are going to be other cars on the bridge too.

1413
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,430
If a famous actress like you expose your face.

1414
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,830
Idiot.

1415
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,740
I'm going to be exposing...

1416
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,240
This face!

1417
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,040
Kiriko Busujima of the Deisan Organization!

1418
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,640
Just as would be expected of you, Vermouth.

1419
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,550
You're a complete duplicate.

1420
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,850
I see.

1421
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:57,250
That's why you've come out front.

1422
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,550
Where's the place?

1423
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,750
Gin.

1424
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,760
We're going to kill DJ at Vane B.

1425
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,630
Bein B?

1426
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,040
Bein B?

1427
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,240
Is that the next assassination site?

1428
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,850
Yeah. The time is 16:00.

1429
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,550
It seems that they're going to kill Mr. Domon

1430
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:30,950
when his car passes over a bridge somewhere.

1431
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:35,660
In other words, the "B" of Bein B means bridge?

1432
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:38,760
But if we can't specify which bridge it is,

1433
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,160
we can't stop the assassination.

1434
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,930
Quiet!

1435
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:45,430
They're checking the map now.

1436
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:48,240
Maybe they'll say the name of the place.

1437
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,040
Korn, you position yourself here.

1438
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,940
Chianti, you go here.

1439
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,740
We're counting on you both!

1440
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,850
Where's my motorbike?

1441
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,950
Oh, yes.

1442
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,150
Behind that container.

1443
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,150
Thank you.

1444
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:07,850
Let's get together in the foreground of Vane B.

1445
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,860
Hey, Kir.

1446
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,160
Don't tell me that you...

1447
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,330
I hope you're not. Are you?

1448
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,340
Idiot.

1449
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,240
Of course not.

1450
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,840
What is it?

1451
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:35,650
Well, I'll go on ahead.

1452
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:39,250
Make sure you back me up if something comes up.

1453
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,350
I have a bad feeling

1454
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,260
about this assassination scheme.

1455
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,860
Leave it to me.

1456
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,530
If things start looking bad and you're in danger of falling in their hands,

1457
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:53,230
I won't hesitate firing a bullet right through your head.

1458
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:57,440
Yes. If such time comes, make sure you aim at my face, okay?

1459
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,640
You don't want the world to know that

1460
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,540
I was part of the assassination scheme, do you?

1461
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,240
Things will turn out badly, right?

1462
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,850
Is there something bothering you, Vermouth?

1463
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:08,950
No.

1464
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,550
It's just this feeling I have.

1465
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:12,950
Don't worry about it.

1466
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:22,430
Okay.

1467
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,930
Let's get going too.

1468
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:32,440
Okay, I don't know how much you know.

1469
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,140
But I wonder if you can stop me?

1470
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,650
My dearest...

1471
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:42,050
Silver Bullet?

1472
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:47,550
So, we don't know where the location is.

1473
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:48,660
Yeah.

1474
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,160
The sound is getting worse from a while ago.

1475
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,730
The only clue we have is that it's on a bridge somewhere.

1476
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:59,530
Maybe we can find out by calling Mr. Domon's election office

1477
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:01,430
and asking them

1478
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,640
where he's headed for now

1479
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,840
and what bridge he'll be crossing.

1480
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,940
I called them several times but...

1481
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,040
They won't tell me.

1482
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,550
Since I was quite persistent,

1483
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:14,250
they seem to suspect me of being up to no good.

1484
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,450
Well...

1485
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:18,350
Unless we find out what the "Bein" of Bein B is.

1486
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,150
This bad direction of the wind won't change.

1487
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,760
Direction of the wind?

1488
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,360
Bein sounds a lot like V. A. I. N.

1489
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:31,030
Which means useless, worthless, and conceited.

1490
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:34,630
I wonder if there was a place with that sort of name in Tokyo?

1491
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,340
No, that's not it.

1492
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,640
It's not V. A. I. N.

1493
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,340
But V. A. N. E. As in Vane!

1494
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,350
What? You mean the vane as in weathervane or a windmill?

1495
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,450
Yeah.

1496
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:50,450
A word that at the same time means the arrow feather of a bow.

1497
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:53,550
The name of a place around here that suggests an arrow feather is.

1498
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:54,850
Toriya-cho!

1499
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,660
In other words, Vane B is Toriya Bridge!

1500
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:59,760
That is Toriya Grand Bridge!

1501
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,330
That's good news!

1502
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,030
We still have two hours till 16:00,

1503
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,930
the scheduled time of the assassination!

1504
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:08,940
We finally get to take the lead!

1505
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,840
There are a total of six of them,

1506
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,240
three women and three men!

1507
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,740
The two women will be riding motorbikes

1508
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,450
and the remaining four will come on two different cars.

1509
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:20,750
One of which is a Porsche 365A.

1510
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:25,350
Let's send the investigator's vehicle to the bridge on the double

1511
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:29,160
and block off all the roads leading to the bridge for now.

1512
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,160
We're going to round them up, right?

1513
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,930
No, we're going to stay low and sneak up from behind.

1514
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:37,830
And make sure we fish them all without fail, one by one.

1515
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,340
Geez!

1516
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,540
Why do I, the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri,

1517
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:50,440
have to play a TV game at your house, Dr. Agasa?

1518
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,350
Well, no big thing, is it?

1519
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,050
You didn't have anything to do anyway, did you?

1520
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,550
Besides, that's a deduction game

1521
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,750
that I developed that I'm quite confident of!

1522
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:03,360
And there's no one else than you to be the first to try it out.

1523
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,360
This game is filled with a lot of cases, isn't it?

1524
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,230
This is already the third case.

1525
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,030
Who cares?

1526
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:12,530
Nobody's dying for real.

1527
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,930
And if a bit of the painful feeling is felt by the player,

1528
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,540
it's served its purpose.

1529
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:20,640
Well, I wish people would keep homicides confined

1530
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,840
to games and TV dramas.

1531
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,450
The grief that one goes through when someone really dies

1532
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:28,950
can't be compared to the one felt through games and TV dramas.

1533
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:31,250
By the way, where's Conan?

1534
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,850
Wasn't he with you, Dr. Agasa?

1535
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:35,260
Oh, yes.

1536
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,160
He went on home before us.

1537
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,860
Because it started raining quite heavily.

1538
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,130
I guess I'll start heading on home too, then.

1539
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:46,130
I don't want Conan to be starving.

1540
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,130
Well...

1541
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:49,640
Don't go home!

1542
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,940
Edogawa will be fine.

1543
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,640
Don't worry about him.

1544
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,850
So, don't go! Please!

1545
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:09,260
-Ai. -Ai.

1546
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,930
Okay, if you say so.

1547
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,330
Then I'll stay.

1548
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:31,790
Well, let's take a look back at the Black Organization.

1549
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,810
How about where you are, Korn?

1550
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:42,010
Clear view.

1551
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:46,710
Yes.

1552
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:48,810
I'm already in position.

1553
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:51,820
Okay! All we need to wait for is Kir.

1554
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,920
Hey, Vodka.

1555
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,620
I keep hearing static on your side.

1556
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,930
No.

1557
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:03,930
It's nothing.

1558
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:17,610
Yes. Only a few minutes until we get there.

1559
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:20,710
Let us know when you get there, Kir.

1560
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:21,810
Roger!

1561
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,100
Excuse me.

1562
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,510
I'd like to ask you something.

1563
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:53,910
Will you please stop your motorbike?

1564
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,000
That is bad!

1565
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:02,110
She's still breathing!

1566
01:31:02,110 --> 01:31:03,520
Rush her to the hospital!

1567
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,720
Okay!

1568
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,630
Rena Mizunashi?

1569
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:16,430
What's Rena Mizunashi doing here?

1570
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:18,900
According to your story,

1571
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,000
wasn't the woman riding this motorbike

1572
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,400
supposed to be Vermouth in disguise?

1573
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,900
I thought so

1574
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,610
because she was quite some distance away from the transmitter.

1575
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:29,110
I thought for sure that was the case, but...

1576
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:32,510
She changed into leather overalls and boots somewhere.

1577
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:37,120
The transmitter and wiretap that are on her loafers are probably there.

1578
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,120
But where did she change?

1579
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:43,920
Not yet?

1580
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,220
Gin.

1581
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,730
Men who keep people waiting are not liked!

1582
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:49,630
Hold your horses, Chianti.

1583
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,800
We haven't got word from Kir yet.

1584
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,500
Besides, DJ's car is still...

1585
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,900
This might not mean anything

1586
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:00,010
but I can't hear a thing because your voice is full of static!

1587
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,310
Static?

1588
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,310
What's up?

1589
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,710
Quiet.

1590
01:32:24,030 --> 01:32:25,500
What?

1591
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,100
You're playing the game, Ran?

1592
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,300
Yes.

1593
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:31,200
And I don't see Mouri around.

1594
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:35,610
Oh. He went home saying that

1595
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:37,510
the main derby is going to start pretty soon.

1596
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:43,020
What's the matter?

1597
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,820
The transmitter switched off.

1598
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:48,020
How? About the noise?

1599
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,520
I can hear something faintly.

1600
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,730
But the sound is muffled.

1601
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:54,730
What?

1602
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:56,230
Cancelled?

1603
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,900
You telling us to quit after coming this far?

1604
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:02,600
Yeah. I got boss' approval just now too.

1605
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,900
To change the target.

1606
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,910
Change?

1607
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:10,310
Change the target?

1608
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:11,910
And, where is it?

1609
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:16,120
The next target.

1610
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:20,120
The place is Beika-cho, Gochome.

1611
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,120
Mouri Detective Agency.

1612
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,920
Mouri Detective Agency?

1613
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,430
The horses have turned the fourth corner

1614
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:31,700
and are running the straight course!

1615
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:34,000
What's this?

1616
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,200
I'm hitting the bull's eye left and right today!

1617
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,710
What? Two black cars together?

1618
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:44,010
They are pulling away from Toriya Grand Bridge?

1619
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:47,510
Are those cars really theirs?

1620
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:50,720
Yes! One of it is a Porsche 356A.

1621
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,520
And the other one is a Viper!

1622
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,720
The Harley was abandoned.

1623
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,720
So that who was riding the motorbike is probably also in the car.

1624
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,030
It can't be!

1625
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:01,030
I mean...

1626
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:03,830
The car that Mr. Domon, their target is on,

1627
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:08,200
is speeding right before our eyes at this moment.

1628
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,300
It's not even on the bridge yet.

1629
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:16,210
In which direction did the two cars head for?

1630
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:18,010
Where are those cars headed?

1631
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:22,820
They turned left on the intersection of Toriya Yonchome

1632
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:25,220
and headed towards Haido-cho?

1633
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,420
Strange.

1634
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,320
They're headed back to where they failed to assassinate their target?

1635
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:34,330
No. Those guys are probably headed for Beika-cho!

1636
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,330
What?

1637
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:38,800
They found the transmitter and wiretap!

1638
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,100
Leave Mr. Domon's car up to the FBI agents car pursuing from behind,

1639
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,000
and head for Beika-cho!

1640
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,500
Pops is in danger!

1641
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,010
What's going on with the car behind?

1642
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:56,010
I was thinking it strange that they were tailing us close for some time.

1643
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,320
Let them be!

1644
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,520
If you get too nervous,

1645
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,920
you won't be able to handle things when you'll really need to.

1646
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,320
I'm really grateful for all you're doing for me.

1647
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:09,030
Well, I, myself have become a man worthy of being protected by you two,

1648
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:11,500
and overcome the fix that I'm in now too.

1649
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,000
A fix?

1650
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I just got word about that.

1651
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,700
It's bad news.

1652
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:22,410
But is it really true?

1653
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:23,710
But is that story about Kogoro Mouri

1654
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:28,710
setting a transmitter and wiretap on the sole of Kir's shoe true?

1655
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:30,720
Yeah, no doubt about it.

1656
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,920
According to the info we got,

1657
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:36,420
the one that Kir was in touch with before meeting us today

1658
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,720
was that guy.

1659
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,630
But that's not enough to suspect him.

1660
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:42,630
I don't know what he set it there for but...

1661
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,700
He's the one that did it.

1662
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,800
If it had been set some days ago, even more so.

1663
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,300
Kir would've realized.

1664
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,600
If it was that famed detective.

1665
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,610
Are you saying that Kir disappeared because of that detective?

1666
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:59,210
Keep your voice down.

1667
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:01,110
The wiretap is still going.

1668
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:04,420
What? Didn't you crush it along with the transmitter?

1669
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:08,020
I have it hidden in my coat, wrapped heavily in cloth

1670
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,320
so that it won't pick up what we say.

1671
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,230
This way, we can throw him off a bit too.

1672
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:16,330
I have something I want to ask that detective

1673
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:20,200
while he's still here in this world with us.

1674
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,100
What? Pops went home?

1675
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,900
Right.

1676
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,710
Ran's still here,

1677
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:29,910
but Mouri left the minute we took our eyes of him.

1678
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,710
Would you like me to go his detective agency

1679
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:33,310
and bring him back here again?

1680
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:36,220
No! Don't!

1681
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:40,820
It seems that he left before the FBI arrived at Dr. Agasa's place!

1682
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:42,320
What's up?

1683
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,720
I'll explain later!

1684
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,220
And until I contact you,

1685
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,330
don't step an inch out of the house until you hear from me!

1686
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:50,930
Please, Pops.

1687
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:52,300
Please...

1688
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,000
Please be okay!

1689
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,990
This... This is scary.

1690
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,490
Too scary.

1691
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:06,900
I've already won 11 races in a row from the first race!

1692
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:10,770
The God of Horse Races must've finally descended upon me?

1693
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,970
Hey. Come on...

1694
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,170
Darn it! This clunker of a TV!

1695
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,770
This always happens at the wrong time!

1696
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,480
Geez!

1697
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,090
Hey! Pops?

1698
01:37:30,090 --> 01:37:31,090
Pops?

1699
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:32,490
Gosh!

1700
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:37,090
I've a 12 races straight win on my shoulders now!

1701
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:39,190
Now for the odds of the final race...

1702
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:41,960
I can't be answering the phone at a time like this!

1703
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,160
Seriously!

1704
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:47,370
What a simpleton.

1705
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:51,170
I blew up the TV antenna and he shows his face.

1706
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:53,170
His ear. He got...

1707
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:56,080
Something and...

1708
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,980
He's probably just listening to the wiretap that he set up

1709
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,480
with all his might.

1710
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:06,590
Then, let's make him hear our voices just as he wishes.

1711
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:09,790
Do you hear me, Kogoro Mouri?

1712
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:10,790
Gin!

1713
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:12,190
Don't you dare to move.

1714
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:14,760
We've target locked your back.

1715
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,570
I have something I'd like to ask you before we open a ventilation hole in your suit.

1716
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:21,070
The relationship between you and Sherry.

1717
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:23,870
The transmitter and wiretap that you set up.

1718
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:27,580
Looks a lot like the ones that woman set up previously.

1719
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:30,780
I won't take coincidence for an answer.

1720
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,580
I'll give you 10 seconds.

1721
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,480
If you decide to answer,

1722
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:38,390
take your left hand away from your earphone and raise it up.

1723
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,790
Earphone.

1724
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:42,690
If the horse makes it, it'll be my win!

1725
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:43,890
I see!

1726
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,790
Pops is listening to the horse races on the radio.

1727
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,070
There, I see it!

1728
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:53,470
Mouri Detective Agency!

1729
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,470
Ten.

1730
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:57,170
Nine.

1731
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:58,570
Eight.

1732
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:00,480
The roof of the car! Quick!

1733
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,180
Seven.

1734
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,580
Six.

1735
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,680
Five.

1736
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,180
Four.

1737
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,780
Three.

1738
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:12,890
Two.

1739
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:14,890
One! Go for it!

1740
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:26,570
A soccer ball?

1741
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:29,470
Hey! Who the heck are you?

1742
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:33,070
I'm sorry, I kicked the ball a little too hard!

1743
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:34,680
Why you...

1744
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,480
By the way, how did the horse race go?

1745
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,280
You were listening to it through the earphone, right?

1746
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,580
Horse race?

1747
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:45,290
Thanks to you, I goofed it!

1748
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:49,790
It seems that he had nothing to do with this.

1749
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:52,190
Get rid both of them.

1750
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:54,500
Okay!

1751
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,670
Punish when in doubt, right?

1752
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:59,470
Wait!

1753
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,970
We don't even conclusive proof,

1754
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,270
and yet if we kill this man who has deep connections with the police...

1755
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:08,280
Enough, Vermouth!

1756
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,380
Gin.

1757
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:19,190
Do you have something going with that detective?

1758
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:20,390
So?

1759
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:22,290
What if I do?

1760
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:24,990
Never mind.

1761
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:29,160
The one who set this up seems to have carelessly left fingerprints behind.

1762
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,370
After we get rid of him,

1763
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,470
if we check his surroundings

1764
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,670
we'll eventually be able to figure out who set it up.

1765
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:40,280
What?

1766
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,280
Behind you at 8 o'clock.

1767
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,980
It's from that building!

1768
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:51,990
It can't be! It's 700 yards away.

1769
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:52,990
Give it to me!

1770
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,970
Shuichi Akai?

1771
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:13,680
We've finally met.

1772
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,480
My dear and dearest arch-enemy.

1773
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,780
My dear.

1774
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:24,590
The FBI. So that's the story.

1775
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:26,090
Gin.

1776
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,190
We're splitting!

1777
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:29,590
But what about the detective and kid?

1778
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:30,590
Never mind!

1779
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:31,790
Get out of here, quick!

1780
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:44,670
Their car is headed west from Beika-cho Gochome.

1781
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,970
Please pursue.

1782
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:49,580
Well, they may throw you off track part way, though.

1783
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:59,090
That gun fire a while ago was shot by an FBI agent?

1784
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:02,590
Yeah, we fell into their trap.

1785
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:07,000
If they didn't know that we were going there from some time ago,

1786
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,660
they couldn't have positioned themselves on that building.

1787
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:13,270
Then, you mean that Kogoro Mouri and the FBI joined hands and...

1788
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:15,070
I don't think so.

1789
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:20,680
To the FBI, he's no more than just a bait to lure us out.

1790
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:25,080
I wonder if they would risk the life of one of their comrades.

1791
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:31,690
They probably got info that he was going to have contact with Kir,

1792
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:33,390
and after the two parted,

1793
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:39,090
the FBI probably set the transmitter and wiretap onto Kir's shoe.

1794
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:42,060
That way, just in case we all get caught,

1795
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:45,270
we would all suspect him because of it.

1796
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:49,370
Let's say that's what happened.

1797
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:53,370
Kogoro Mouri seems to be your favorite detective after all.

1798
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,280
Thank you.

1799
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,180
The problem for now is Kir.

1800
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:01,080
Don't tell me, the FBI...

1801
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,280
Yeah.

1802
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:05,290
There's probably no doubt that she fell into their hands.

1803
01:43:05,290 --> 01:43:09,390
Well, but I don't think Kir is the type to spit things easily.

1804
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:12,690
I'll search her out no matter what it takes.

1805
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:15,560
Do you have an idea where she is?

1806
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,870
Hints are everywhere.

1807
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:21,270
It's not that I believe that Kogoro Mouri

1808
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:23,970
is completely innocent yet, either.

1809
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,180
Did you see the TV program on this morning?

1810
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:35,180
Yeah. The news about Mr. Domon passing up

1811
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:38,290
being a candidate for election this time, right?

1812
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:41,490
The reason is suspicion of his father, a government official,

1813
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:43,090
having an extra-marital affair.

1814
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:45,190
Which was 20 years ago.

1815
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:48,960
Mr. Domon seems to have agreed to a special interview with Nichiuri TV,

1816
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,770
under the condition that they keep this affair thing a secret,

1817
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:55,970
but it was found that Rena Mizunashi had made up on her own.

1818
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:59,670
Which means she was not commuting to work to the TV station.

1819
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:04,180
Well, if they had known that he was such a righteous guy

1820
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:06,880
that would give up candidacy for something like that.

1821
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,080
They wouldn't have had to go through all the trouble.

1822
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:15,090
Only if we could arrest two or three of those guys.

1823
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:17,690
I could've blown off his leg,

1824
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:21,860
but I fired through his bullet proof jacket and left it at that.

1825
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,460
I didn't want to stop them carelessly

1826
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:25,770
and start a gunfire battle in the middle of town

1827
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:29,070
while risking the general public falling prey to bullets.

1828
01:44:29,070 --> 01:44:30,170
Besides, in this case,

1829
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,970
it was our top priority to make them think that

1830
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:36,280
it was the FBI who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

1831
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:38,080
Right?

1832
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,580
That's true, but...

1833
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:41,880
Besides, it's not only that.

1834
01:44:44,490 --> 01:44:46,290
All ties have been severed with them either.

1835
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:49,590
Although her life is not in danger,

1836
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:52,390
she seems to be still unconscious.

1837
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:55,060
I guess all we can do is wait for her to recover.

1838
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:58,670
I've asked them to keep the fact that she's been hospitalized hidden.

1839
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:01,770
But if an announcer suddenly disappears,

1840
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:06,670
the TV station will not overlook it, will they?

1841
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,780
That boy said don't worry.

1842
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:11,580
He'd work something out.

1843
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,880
That boy again.

1844
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,480
Who is he, anyway?

1845
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,090
A detective.

1846
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,290
He's my favorite.

1847
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:22,690
Personnel manager?

1848
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:24,290
This is Rena Mizunashi!

1849
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:26,390
I'm very sorry to say this,

1850
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:28,260
but I'd like to take time off for a while.

1851
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,590
How lucky you are.

1852
01:46:57,590 --> 01:47:00,990
Detective Mouri who was hanging around you was suspected,

1853
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,590
and escape being killed by them by a hairsbreadth.

1854
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:05,990
But he was saved at the very last moment.

1855
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:10,470
That guy foresaw what was going to happen and ambushed them

1856
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:14,870
to make those guys think that it was the FBI who schemed all this.

1857
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:17,770
Well, you'd better thank that Akai guy.

1858
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:20,370
Yeah, I really appreciate what he did.

1859
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:24,280
As well as Dr. Agasa and you for sheltering Ran at Dr. Agasa's place.

1860
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,380
By the way, is everything all right?

1861
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:30,380
It seems that nobody's keeping guard over Detective Mouri since then.

1862
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:32,390
It's safer not to have anybody guard him

1863
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:34,890
so I refused the FBI's offer to guard him.

1864
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:36,990
I mean this is the chance to show them that

1865
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:39,690
Pops has nothing to do with the FBI.

1866
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:41,600
If I carelessly ask the FBI to guard him,

1867
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,670
and they suspect that Pops is involved after all.

1868
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:46,670
That would be more dangerous.

1869
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:48,170
True, but...

1870
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:53,070
Besides, we got a card that they left behind for us.

1871
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:56,680
Announcer Rena Mizunashi, right?

1872
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,880
I hear she's unconscious and in the hospital.

1873
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,280
Yeah. I hear that the FBI are on guard around the clock

1874
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:06,090
waiting for her to get up.

1875
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:09,490
But if those guys find the hospital...

1876
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:10,690
Don't worry!

1877
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:13,090
I called the TV station using her voice and told them that

1878
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:15,360
she'll be going on a long leave of absence.

1879
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:19,170
So, I'm sure those guys won't think that she's in the hospital either.

1880
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:21,870
At any rate, always keep on your guard.

1881
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,870
I'm sure that those guys are frantically looking for

1882
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,280
her whereabouts right now, too.

1883
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:32,880
Yeah. Those guy would do anything to achieve their purpose.
