1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,080
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,180
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,680
Today's stage is a jam packed stadium.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,680
Fear closes in on the cheers of the audience.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,180
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,380
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,790
I'm a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

9
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,890
I went with an old friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

10
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,590
to an amusement park.

11
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,290
where I witnessed a suspicious deal with a man dressed in black.

12
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,990
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

13
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,290
that I didn't notice a second man sneak up from behind me.

14
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,190
He beat me up and forced me to take a poison,

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,890
and when I woke up...

16
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,390
My body had shrunk!

17
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,790
If they learned Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

18
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,190
people around me would be in danger.

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,390
Per Dr. Agasa's advice, I decided to conceal my identity.

20
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,590
When Ran asked my name,

21
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,990
I quickly answered "Conan Edogawa".

22
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,690
To get information on the men,

23
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,990
I wound up living with Ran and her detective father.

24
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,290
"Indiscriminate Murder Threat at the Stadium (Part 1)"

25
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,290
Hey, don't you think that

26
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,390
the dancing lion looks like Inspector Megure?

27
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,990
Huh?

28
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,890
Just what do you think you're doing, Takagi?

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,690
Very true!

30
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,290
It does, doesn't it?

31
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,290
It also looks like Genta.

32
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,290
What are you saying?

33
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,790
See, you look just like it!

34
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,290
How dare you!

35
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,590
Stop right there!

36
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,290
Hey! We'd better hurry, or the game will start!

37
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,790
Yeah, I know.

38
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,790
-Let's go, Mitsuhiko. -Okay.

39
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,290
Hey, Ran. One more serving!

40
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,890
What? Another serving?

41
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,790
This is your sixth serving.

42
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,690
What's the big deal?

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,290
After all, it's New Year's Day. Let me drink all I like.

44
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,190
You're always drinking all you like anyway.

45
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,990
Where is the little one?

46
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,490
Conan went to watch a soccer game.

47
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,890
He said it's the Emperor Cup Finals.

48
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,290
What's the fun of going out

49
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,890
to watch a soccer game on New Year's Day?

50
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,290
What better way is there to spend New Year's Day

51
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,790
than to watch Yoko on TV while drinking sake.

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,990
Here goes!

53
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,690
Treat me...

54
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,990
Stone, paper, scissors squad!

55
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,990
What's this program about?

56
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,090
A special New Year's program, maybe?

57
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,790
Besides, I don't think Yoko's coming on today

58
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,690
until the Afternoon Drama Special.

59
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,890
What? She's not coming on until this afternoon?

60
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,790
What bummers!

61
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,090
I guess I'll take a snooze,

62
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,890
so wake me up when the drama starts.

63
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,790
Hey, Dad! You'll catch a cold.

64
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,290
"January 1st, National Stadium, Emperor's Cup Finals"

65
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,690
"Big Osaka, Tokyo Spirits"

66
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,290
Who's the one that just scored? What's his name?

67
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,290
Hide of the Spirits.

68
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,890
Hide struck a heading at Naoki's centering.

69
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,590
-Just as expected of Hide! -Yes!

70
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,890
If it were not for his wound, he would have surely been chosen

71
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,890
as one of the players on the Japan team.

72
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,390
Talking about the Japan team,

73
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,190
it's too bad they couldn't win the World Cup.

74
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,390
To think that they couldn't win even one game is so vexing.

75
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,390
I wonder all the adults were so excited about it too?

76
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,390
Dad said that it's like a dream that Japan got to play.

77
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,690
It seems to be a super fantastic match.

78
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,490
-You idiots. -Huh?

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,590
The World Cup is one of the world's greatest events

80
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,990
in which nations all over the world,

81
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,290
compete with their entire heart and soul.

82
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,290
It's no wonder that the Japanese are making a big thing of it.

83
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,690
Well, but I'm sure vexed that Japan couldn't win even one game.

84
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,590
But it only goes to show that the walls of the world are not easy to break through.

85
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,790
How can you be so reserved?

86
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,490
You're the one who looked the most vexed

87
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,090
after we finished watching TV.

88
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,590
Exactly, exactly.

89
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,190
You were having a fit on the table of Dr. Agasa's home.

90
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,090
I couldn't help it

91
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,990
because participating in the World Cup

92
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,890
was my dream since I was a kid.

93
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,990
What do you mean "Since you were a kid", Conan?

94
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,490
You're still a kid, Conan.

95
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,090
When on earth did you begin watching soccer, anyway?

96
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,590
Well, that is, you see...

97
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,090
What's so funny, Haibara?

98
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,690
Mr. Renown Detective, you turn into a mere child

99
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,190
when it comes to soccer, don't you?

100
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,490
Leave me alone.

101
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,390
Didn't you come here to watch the game?

102
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,690
I just came here because you all did.

103
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,190
They know what I used to look like when I was a child, you know.

104
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,690
If I were to be seen on the TV screen,

105
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,090
they'll find me on the spot.

106
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,190
If that happens, would it put you into a fix too?

107
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,190
That's why I wasn't really up to coming...

108
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,790
Hey!

109
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,790
How's that? This way, it wouldn't matter

110
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,090
if you're were to be seen on camera, right?

111
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,290
Come on!

112
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,390
Forget about them for now,

113
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,890
and let's watch the game.

114
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,990
Soccer games are best seen live.

115
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,390
All right! Go!

116
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,090
Shinichi.

117
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,590
I'll bet it hasn't even crossed your mind

118
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,690
that you are already deeply involved in a secret project

119
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,090
that our organization has been working on since half a century ago.

120
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,390
Switch from camera 2 to camera 1.

121
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,190
Camera 1 don't miss the goal scene.

122
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,290
Camera 4, what are you doing?

123
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,190
Mr. Kaneko.

124
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,990
What is it, at a busy time like this?

125
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,890
Will you please take this call?

126
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,290
The call? Is it for me?

127
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,390
Yes. He's been repeatedly saying

128
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,390
that you'd regret if you don't take the call.

129
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,090
Shoots. What a nuisance.

130
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,990
Yes, this is Director Kaneko.

131
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,190
Hello? Who are you?

132
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,790
I'll say this only once so listen close.

133
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,490
Look at the boy in the front row

134
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,490
who is leaning out against the railing, right up ahead to the right side of the bleachers.

135
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,190
What?

136
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,690
Hey, camera 13 is open now, isn't it?

137
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,490
Will you zoom the bleachers to the right?

138
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,890
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,690
Hey, camera 13!

140
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,190
Very composed.

141
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,990
People watching such an interesting game

142
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,590
would normally react like that.

143
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,290
Go, Hide!

144
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,190
-Hang in there! -Right there, Ramus!

145
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,790
Doesn't your heart ever skip a beat, or don't you ever get excited?

146
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,690
Don't you have such emotions?

147
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,490
I wonder, maybe if you look around, you'll find them.

148
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,690
Even when you came to class the first day.

149
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,490
I would normally be embarrassing to study among kids,

150
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,690
but you didn't seem to mind at all.

151
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,690
Most naturally.

152
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,790
-You were there. -What?

153
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,790
I remained composed because you were in that class.

154
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,790
You, who are in the same predicament as I.

155
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,490
Yeah, I see them, 5 kids.

156
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,090
The boy on the left edge wearing the blue cap?

157
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,790
Yeah. What about that kid?

158
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,290
Can I ask you one question?

159
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,490
What?

160
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,790
How old are you anyway?

161
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,290
-48 years old. -What?

162
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,590
I'm just kidding.

163
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,990
I'm actually...

164
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,590
-What is it? -What's the matter?

165
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,990
The ball suddenly bounced and...

166
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,490
Conan!

167
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,990
Hey!

168
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,490
There are two holes in the ball.

169
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,590
Don't tell me that...

170
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,690
You shouldn't be in here.

171
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,590
But I dropped my cap.

172
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,390
Your cap?

173
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,890
If so, it should be left somewhere on this rubber court.

174
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,490
Here it is! This is it!

175
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,390
Here you go, sonny.

176
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,190
The cap that you dropped.

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,790
Hey, sonny! Just what do you think you're doing?

178
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,690
Hey!

179
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,390
What's your problem, sonny?

180
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,590
This is a 7.62 millimeter bullet.

181
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,390
A full metal jacket.

182
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,990
It's a gun! A gun!

183
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,490
Somebody in this stadium fired a gun, Inspector Megure.

184
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,690
And, where is the victim who was shot?

185
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,590
Nobody was shot, just a soccer ball was.

186
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,190
A soccer ball?

187
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,790
I did as I was told by the man who called

188
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,890
and was looking at the ball that rolled right below the boy

189
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,490
in the front row wearing a blue cap with monitor.

190
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,790
Then, the ball suddenly...

191
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,190
bounced and the air leaked out of the ball.

192
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,790
I'm sure the ball was shot by a gun.

193
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,990
But maybe it was a prank where an air gun was used.

194
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,990
It's most likely a Tocaref.

195
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,190
Huh?

196
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,990
Conan?

197
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,290
The Youth Detective Squad at your service...

198
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,090
Come off it, you guys.

199
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,290
You guys were here, too.

200
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,490
It's her, right?

201
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,490
The child with the blue cap that you were looking at?

202
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,490
What? Yeah, right.

203
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,090
Which means that you guys were watching the whole thing too?

204
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,790
Yes. The ball suddenly bounced and air leaked out of it.

205
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,790
So, I went down into the field right away and found this.

206
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,990
A bullet that pierced through the rubber court.

207
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,890
What?

208
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,590
7.62 millimeter bullet. Russian made.

209
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,290
A Russian gun that can be loaded with this bullet

210
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,490
would be one that is frequently smuggled via China into Japan,

211
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,090
most probably a Tocaref.

212
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,190
It is extremely deadly

213
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,390
and has a high capability of killing its target.

214
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,590
Gun fire was not heard,

215
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,690
so the killer probably used a silencer.

216
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,690
Why are you so knowledgeable?

217
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,790
Of course Pops told me all of this.

218
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,490
Gosh. What's with him teaching a kid something like this?

219
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,090
The game's off! Off!

220
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,990
Stop the game right this minute

221
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,690
and evacuate the spectators as well as the players.

222
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,690
Yes, sir...

223
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,190
No!

224
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,990
The man who called said,

225
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,790
if we do anything funny like stop the game

226
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,590
or let the spectators go,

227
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,290
he'd shoot indiscriminately throughout the stadium!

228
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,890
What?

229
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,890
And, what does the criminal want?

230
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,690
He says to have 50,000,000 yen put into a bag

231
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,390
and ready by half-time.

232
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,390
As to where to take it, he said he'd call back later.

233
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,290
Did he demand that of you people?

234
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,490
Yes, to Nichiuri TV.

235
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,890
Could it be someone who has a grudge against Nichiuri TV?

236
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,290
Or, could it be a terrorist?

237
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,690
Do you have any idea as to the voice of the man?

238
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,590
The thing is,

239
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,590
his voice is muffled and hard to make out.

240
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,190
He probably had a cloth over the receiver

241
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,390
or was wearing a mask.

242
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,190
And, did you get the 50,000,000 yen ready?

243
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,590
Yes, it's on its way here.

244
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:38,390
Okay! Scatter plain clothes officers through the audience!

245
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,690
Our chance is when the criminal calls.

246
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,390
The moment he calls,

247
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,390
nab everyone who is using the phone.

248
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,690
Yes, sir...

249
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,490
It's dangerous here.

250
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,390
-You folks go on home. -Okay.

251
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,590
Hey. Is that kid wearing the blue cap a girl?

252
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,290
How rude. Can't you tell by looking at her?

253
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,690
Strange. The man who called said,

254
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,190
the boy in the blue cap to the extreme left of all the 5 kids.

255
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,690
Please wait, Inspector Megure!

256
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,790
It's not a good idea to nab the criminal just like that.

257
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,690
What do you mean?

258
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,290
The ball was right below us,

259
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,390
which means that the criminal shot from nearby us, right?

260
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,290
Yeah. He shot from a range that is not difficult to shoot from.

261
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,290
Besides, it'll be no laughing matter if he missed.

262
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,090
If the criminal is nearby, why did he mistake her for a boy?

263
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,790
Looking at her clothes, anybody can see that she's a girl.

264
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,590
Maybe he couldn't see her skirt because of a wall or something.

265
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,690
If the wall blocked his view,

266
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,190
it would mean that he was at the back stand right opposite us.

267
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,190
In other words, the person who told us

268
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,790
about the gun going off over the phone,

269
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,290
and the person who actually fired are different people.

270
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,990
There are at least more than two people involved, right?

271
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,790
Hey! Inform all the officers by radio,

272
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,390
and tell them not to move until I order them to.

273
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,590
Yes, sir!

274
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,390
What are they going to do?

275
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,590
Can they find the criminals with what little clue there is?

276
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,990
How do we find him in this stadium

277
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,090
packed with 56,000 people?

278
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,280
To all officers scattered among the audience.

279
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,580
There are more than two criminals.

280
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,380
And one of them is most likely armed with a Tocaref.

281
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,780
Don't do anything even if you see somebody suspicious.

282
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,480
Just keep on watch until further orders.

283
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,980
We can't be sure what the criminals will do

284
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,780
to save their companions.

285
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,180
Listen. Don't you ever let them suspect that you're officers.

286
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,980
Be very careful

287
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,480
and exert your entire efforts into nabbing the criminals.

288
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,080
The next time the criminal will make his move is when he calls

289
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,980
to designate where to pick up the ransom he demanded.

290
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,180
Check each and every person in this stadium

291
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,680
who is using the phone at that time.

292
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,380
-And check also for binoculars. -Huh?

293
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,080
I said before just a while ago, didn't I?

294
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,780
That the criminal was watching us

295
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,780
from the back stand right opposite us.

296
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,680
He could see that there were 5 of us,

297
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,880
as well as that there was one kid wearing a blue cap, from so far away.

298
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,480
He couldn't have possibly seen that the ball

299
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,180
was right below that kid with his bare eyes.

300
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,080
Besides the cellular phone,

301
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,480
the criminal probably has binoculars, or...

302
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880
-Opera glasses! -A telescope.

303
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,780
A mobile video camera.

304
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,080
A camera with zoom lenses should also be checked.

305
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,180
True.

306
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,680
There is a high probability that one of the criminals

307
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,980
have something that will help him view quite a distance away.

308
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Please keep that in mind.

309
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,580
Inspector! The phone!

310
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,180
I wonder if it's from the criminal?

311
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,280
Stay calm.

312
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,580
Okay, the phone is ringing. It could be the criminal.

313
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,280
All of you go and check on anybody

314
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,380
and inform me of his location.

315
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,580
If it's from the criminal,

316
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,280
try to do everything you can to prolong the conversation, understand?

317
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,380
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,880
Hello? This is Kaneko, the director.

319
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,480
Hello?

320
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,980
Why didn't you answer the phone right away?

321
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,580
Don't tell me you contacted the police?

322
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,880
No way. I just had some problems picking up the phone.

323
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,180
It's from the criminal. Find him.

324
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,680
Well, never mind. Is the money ready?

325
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,080
Yeah.

326
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,180
Put the money at the exit of Gate 18.

327
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,580
Place it there during the loss time of the first half of the game.

328
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,480
Don't goof.

329
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,580
Hey, wait! Hello?

330
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,080
He hung up. How about it? Did you find him?

331
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,580
This is sector "E".

332
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,580
An elderly man was using the phone till just a while ago.

333
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,880
This is sector "K".

334
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
There is one person here on the phone,

335
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,280
but he is still using it so I don't think he's the criminal.

336
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,380
He may be contacting the others in his group.

337
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Keep your eyes on him.

338
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,880
Hey, Takagi! How about your side?

339
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
The ones who were on the phone at that time

340
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,180
are the 8 people here.

341
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,780
Were you also watching the aisles

342
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,080
and dressing rooms of this building?

343
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,380
Yes. Officers were also watching over the restrooms,

344
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,380
but nobody was on the phone.

345
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,880
And of course nobody left the stadium either.

346
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
I had the cameras that were open, check the audience too,

347
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,680
but it seems that only these 8 people were using the phone.

348
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,280
There seems to be no mistake

349
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,180
that one of the criminals is among the eight.

350
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,580
But, Inspector.

351
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,880
I wonder if the criminal is really going to come get the money?

352
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,480
Well, I don't think he'll come just like that.

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Don't take your eyes off the eight in question.

354
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,980
We'll have to nab them all

355
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,980
before they realize that we are here.

356
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,580
Where's my wireless radio?

357
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Oh, this?

358
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Yes, that's it.

359
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,180
-Here you go. -Thank you, Conan.

360
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Okay, now all of you who are checking the building...

361
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,280
What did you set up on that wireless radio?

362
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,480
Yeah, a wire tap.

363
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,380
I want to at least be aware of what the police is doing.

364
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,780
Do you know where Genta and the others are?

365
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,680
They ran off delightedly

366
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,880
when I told them that they could come back in

367
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,180
with half of the ticket that they had.

368
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,680
Delightedly...

369
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,580
Don't tell me they...

370
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,180
This is Genta. Genta here.

371
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,080
Did you find any suspicious looking guy? Over.

372
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,780
Mitsuhiko here.

373
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,880
No, no one suspicious. Over.

374
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,380
Ayumi! How's it going over there?

375
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,380
Nope, nothing's happening here.

376
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Yes, this is Ayumi.

377
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,180
What do you mean, "this is Ayumi"?

378
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,880
Just what do you think you guys are doing?

379
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,780
The criminal is armed with a gun, you know!

380
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,080
Let me and the police handle the criminals

381
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,680
and you kids hurry on out of here.

382
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,480
No way!

383
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,580
You're a kid too, aren't you?

384
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,880
We want to help arrest the criminals, too.

385
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,980
We're all members of the Youth Detective Squad, aren't we?

386
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,580
All right.

387
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,980
Don't you dare move on your own

388
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,580
even if you find somebody suspicious then.

389
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,180
Contact me, understand?

390
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,080
Okay...

391
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,580
Gosh.

392
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,180
They may come in quite handy.

393
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm sure it wouldn't dawn on the criminals to suspect children.

394
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,080
That's true, but...

395
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,580
Oh, no. It's already loss time.

396
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,580
It's time to put the bag with the cash at gate number 18.

397
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,080
Sato here. The bag is still intact.

398
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Tamiya here. Nobody is approaching the bag yet.

399
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,380
He's come, Inspector!

400
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,480
He's a man wearing sunglasses, dressed in a gray coat

401
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,180
and wearing a white mask.

402
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,880
The man just picked up the bag.

403
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,980
Is there anybody else around?

404
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,480
-No, he's alone. -Okay.

405
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,380
Nab him!

406
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,580
The gun! Look for the gun!

407
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,880
It's nowhere!

408
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,980
Talk! Where is it? Where's the gun?

409
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,480
Don't touch!

410
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Don't touch my partner!

411
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,780
I'll shoot at the audience!

412
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,680
Get away from him!

413
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,180
Partner?

414
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,480
So the police were snooping around after all.

415
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,280
Hey, what's this all about?

416
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,680
Mr. Kaneko of Nichiuri TV.

417
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,880
Well, that's...

418
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,980
Taking me lightly, huh?

419
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,480
I guess one person will have to die to set an example!

420
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,880
Hey, wait!

421
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,480
We're in a fix.

422
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,680
Well, I wonder who I should kill?

423
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,380
I've gotta whole load of targets to choose from.

424
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,880
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
"TV Camera"

426
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
In the next episode, the case and game is settled.

427
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,080
Goal! To the criminal!
