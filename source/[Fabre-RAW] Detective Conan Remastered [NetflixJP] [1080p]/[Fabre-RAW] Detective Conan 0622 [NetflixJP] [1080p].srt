1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:04,291
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,691
You must be true to yourself.

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,191
A sound echoes from a vacant building.

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,691
The rhythmic pattern is the signal of a crime.

5
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,291
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,391
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:03,017
"Emergency 252 (Part 1)"

9
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,517
Are serious, Conan?

10
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:13,217
You found the culprit at the Wimbledon Center and nabbed him?

11
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,217
Sort of...

12
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,117
What kind of case was it?

13
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,117
Yeah...

14
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,717
he was a vicious culprit who caused fear throughout London.

15
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,117
He blew up two hospitals!

16
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,917
Just as would be expected of the Grass Court Queen.

17
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:37,617
Nice centering to right in front of the goal!

18
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:46,217
My God...

19
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:48,217
You're really something!

20
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:50,617
I'll bet it made the news.

21
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:53,117
Not yet,

22
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:55,717
it seems a young boy from Japan shouted out loud

23
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,417
and the match was postponed it says...

24
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,317
Was that you?

25
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:04,017
Yeah, I did it inevitably to nab the culprit.

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,117
Well, I guess you can't really expose what happened, can you?

27
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:11,417
Because Conan Edogawa is a boy who can't enter Great Britain.

28
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,917
Yeah. Dad smoothly deceived everyone for me.

29
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,717
Oh! Kamen Yaiba!

30
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:19,517
Really!

31
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:24,317
This is the new figurine that is selling from today!

32
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:27,017
Yaiba is super awesome after all!

33
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,517
Really, it's so well made!

34
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,017
I want it, I really want it!

35
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:35,717
-There's the Laser Police over here too! -And? How was it?

36
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:36,817
I wish Ma would buy it for me...

37
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,317
You broke your promise with me, drank the antidote,

38
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,717
returned to Shinichi Kudo's body

39
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:45,817
and met the girl from the detective agency in London, didn't you?

40
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:50,617
Oh, yeah, thanks for the spare drug.

41
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:54,117
Don't tell me that you got carried away

42
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,117
and gave yourself away?

43
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,217
Huh?

44
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,217
No. Let me go!

45
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,717
You're such a nuisance!

46
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,217
Huh?

47
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:12,317
You're a nuisance of a difficult case to solve!

48
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:14,817
You've got so many extra emotions mixed up

49
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,817
that I wouldn't be able to make things out even if I were Holmes!

50
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,317
Especially when it comes accurately making out

51
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:24,417
what's going on inside the heart of the girl I love!

52
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,117
Let me tell you again,

53
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,417
that you have a body

54
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:43,717
that is capable of returning to normal only temporarily.

55
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,817
Under such conditions, what do you think will happen

56
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,217
if you give yourself away to her who's been waiting for you for so long?

57
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:52,017
You, yourself said so yourself sometime in the past, didn't you?

58
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,617
That she would miss you even more,

59
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:57,817
and that it would end up making her sadder.

60
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:01,417
I couldn't help it, could I? I couldn't stop it...

61
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,117
Don't forget, okay?

62
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:06,617
You're an existence that's prohibited from exposing yourself to the public!

63
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:11,017
You've got to stay hidden, until the time comes, understand?

64
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:14,317
What's this? Are you going to play hide-and-seek?

65
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:16,317
Let's play kick the can, then!

66
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,817
I've got the juice can that Genta just finished drinking up too.

67
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:23,017
Okay, then I know a good place to play!

68
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:25,317
Let's go...

69
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,417
Let's go!

70
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,717
See, it's this building, over here!

71
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:37,517
The other day, I came and went inside through the space between the shutter

72
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:40,517
and found no one inside.

73
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:43,517
It's amazing you found a place like this, Genta.

74
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,217
It'll be lots of fun playing kick the can here!

75
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:47,617
Yes!

76
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:52,517
If I remember correctly, this building is scheduled to come down next week.

77
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:56,517
But, how careless of them to keep the shutter open.

78
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:58,817
It's true!

79
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,917
The inside is practically all empty!

80
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:03,917
-See! -This is just the place!

81
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:16,117
Come on everybody who wants to play hide-and-seek whatevers...

82
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:20,517
Okay, hide!

83
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:21,917
Okay!

84
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,017
One,

85
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:30,217
two,

86
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,617
three,

87
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:33,017
four,

88
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,317
five,

89
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:35,917
six,

90
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,317
seven,

91
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,917
eight,

92
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,317
nine,

93
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,717
ten.

94
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:46,017
Geez. So, I end up being it after all.

95
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,117
Well, I did warn them to let me know right away

96
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,317
if they find anyone or anything suspicious,

97
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:51,017
so I guess I don't need to worry.

98
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:54,417
Playing once would probably satisfy them besides...

99
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,317
I guess I'll get it over with quickly then!

100
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,517
There! Found you!

101
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,717
He already found you, Ai?

102
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,317
Sorry.

103
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,917
Well, it can't be helped

104
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:13,317
because after all, the one who's It, has an almost devilish talent

105
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:17,817
for smoking out people who are desperately trying to hide themselves.

106
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,117
What a rude way to put it.

107
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:23,517
-I didn't mean to be. -The only one left is Genta.

108
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,817
It's just a matter of time.

109
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:29,017
The only places I didn't look are the third and fourth floors.

110
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,417
Genta is on one of those floors.

111
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,717
Hey, Conan.

112
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,417
It's Genta's voice.

113
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,217
Can you hear me, Conan?

114
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:39,417
What's up, Genta?

115
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,317
There's someone in this building!

116
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,417
Huh? What do you mean?

117
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,517
I heard a sound a while ago!

118
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:48,017
Like the wall being pounded or something.

119
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,117
Oh, there, again!

120
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,417
Hey, Genta?

121
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:59,317
There's the sound again!

122
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:01,117
Somebody is here after all!

123
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,917
Are you sure, Genta?

124
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,117
Yeah!

125
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:09,017
It sounds like somebody's pounding on the wall in the distance.

126
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,317
Do you hear that sound even now?

127
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,917
I don't hear it now, but...

128
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:17,017
First, I heard it twice, then next five times,

129
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:20,017
I heard two times again, and then it stopped.

130
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,117
252!

131
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,017
Someone is in need of rescue!

132
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:27,917
Isn't that the call code for the Tokyo Fire Department?

133
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,817
Big sis told me so the other day.

134
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:34,617
She said that if I remembered it, it may come in handy one day.

135
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:36,017
252 is the code used to notify that

136
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,217
there is someone who didn't escape in time,

137
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,917
or that someone is in need of rescue.

138
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,917
254 is a code that tells you to wait where you are.

139
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:47,817
If the sound that Genta heard was 252,

140
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:50,317
somebody must be calling for help.

141
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:52,417
No way.

142
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,117
At any rate, let's go to where Genta is.

143
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:57,517
We'll think things out after that!

144
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:58,917
Yes!

145
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:18,117
It was quiet?

146
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:21,917
You mean you heard nothing while we were coming here?

147
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,117
No.

148
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:27,017
I guess we'll just have to look into each room then.

149
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:30,317
Where did the sound come from?

150
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:32,217
Over that side.

151
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:37,317
Was it this sound?

152
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,117
Yeah.

153
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,417
But, it's not 252.

154
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,417
I guess we'll just have to check it out.

155
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,117
The sound's coming from the floor above.

156
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,217
It's coming from this room.

157
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:03,917
You guys stay back!

158
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:07,217
We can't be sure how things are inside.

159
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,717
What're you kids doing here?

160
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,917
No, no! You can't come into this building without permission!

161
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,917
What're you doing, sir?

162
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,517
We're going to be bringing this building down,

163
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,217
so we're checking on how strong the walls are by pounding on them!

164
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:43,217
Rhythmically, like so!

165
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:47,817
He always gets carried away and pounds in time to music.

166
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:51,117
Work seriously now,

167
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,217
because we've still got a lot of rooms to check yet.

168
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:56,417
Yes, sir.

169
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:00,717
Then, what about the 252 that Genta heard?

170
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:04,717
The rhythm of the music must've coincidentally been 252.

171
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,317
Gee whiz.

172
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,917
Say...

173
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,517
Are there only the two of you?

174
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,517
Yeah.

175
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,117
Right.

176
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:17,617
But aren't these the left-overs of the convenience store lunch boxes

177
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,317
you bought today for lunch?

178
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,817
There are three lunch box containers here, though?

179
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:26,417
Oh, he eats two lunches all by himself!

180
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,617
Yeah! I can eat for two just like that.

181
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:31,917
Hey, kids, this place is off limits, you know!

182
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,317
That's right, so get out of here quickly.

183
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,517
Okay!

184
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,217
Will do!

185
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:39,317
Hurry on home, and do your homework!

186
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,117
You can play after you're done!

187
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,117
Okay!

188
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,017
Let's go home, then!

189
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:46,317
Don't work too hard!

190
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,217
Oh, that's right,

191
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,817
may I just ask you one last question?

192
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:56,917
How much explosives are going to be used to bring this building down?

193
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,417
Beats me...

194
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,617
because we haven't finished checking yet, can't tell.

195
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:03,917
This building is pretty big,

196
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,317
so I guess quite a lot would be used.

197
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:09,817
I see! Then, it'll be a pretty big boom!

198
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,117
Yeah!

199
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:12,717
Come watch!

200
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,417
Okay, bye!

201
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,417
It turned out to be nothing after all.

202
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:23,817
Yeah, and I was expecting it to be a criminal case or something.

203
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:26,717
Well, let's come to watch,

204
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,017
all of us together when they bring down this building!

205
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,017
Yeah, let's watch!

206
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,017
It sounds great, doesn't it?

207
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,317
No.

208
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,817
I don't think they have such a thing

209
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:36,417
as bringing down the building using explosives.

210
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,017
When it comes to bringing building down,

211
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,517
the usual procedure would be to lift a heavy duty machine

212
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:42,117
on the top of the building start destroying the building

213
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:44,917
from the top or the side.

214
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,017
Even more so, when it comes to destroying buildings in the city.

215
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,617
But, I've seen on TV.

216
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,417
When they blew up a big building...

217
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,017
There's a big bang

218
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:56,351
and the building comes collapsing down really nicely, right?

219
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,051
That's an image of what they do abroad.

220
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,451
In Japan, there are only a few cases

221
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,751
where they blow buildings up and destroy them.

222
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:07,251
But, the Haido Museum was brought down Doc's bomb, right?

223
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:09,551
Yes, tropical rainbow!

224
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:19,951
It was really pretty, wasn't it?

225
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:20,951
Yes!

226
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,251
It was super awesome!

227
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:24,451
That method was allowed on that building

228
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:25,851
because it was combined with a special event and also

229
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:31,951
because there were only dilapidated vacant buildings in the vicinity!

230
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,851
All Doc did was rig the bomb

231
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:39,651
so that it emitted seven colors when the bomb exploded though.

232
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,751
And besides, that museum was much larger than this,

233
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:45,351
so if it were to be brought down by something other than using explosives,

234
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:49,151
they say the cost would've been too high.

235
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,151
Well, in Japan where the regulations

236
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:54,551
for handling explosives are so strict,

237
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:58,651
and being that there is an occupied building right next door,

238
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,251
it's utterly unthinkable

239
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,951
that this building would be brought down by blowing it up.

240
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:03,551
The amount of explosives to be used

241
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,351
would have to be measured precisely while checking it over

242
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,951
with the blue print of the framework of the building,

243
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,451
it's not the kind of work you can do

244
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,251
without bringing anything but a hammer along!

245
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,951
Then, who were those people?

246
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,151
People who were disguised as workers

247
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,151
who confined somebody in this building.

248
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:24,451
In other words, bad guys.

249
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:26,151
-What? -What?

250
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,751
Confined?

251
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,651
Yeah, because there were three lunch boxes.

252
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:33,751
So, there's no doubt that they're hiding there's one more person here.

253
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:38,751
But, they said that the fat man ate two lunches.

254
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:42,551
There were three used wooden chopsticks left.

255
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,651
If one person ate up two lunches,

256
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,951
he wouldn't open another set of chopsticks, would he?

257
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:51,551
Then the sound 252 that Genta heard was?

258
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:55,551
Probably someone who heard our voices playing Kick the Can,

259
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,351
and tried to send out an SOS by pounding on the wall.

260
00:14:58,351 --> 00:15:00,851
The someone who's confined...

261
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:04,451
In other words, inside this building there's a "252"...

262
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,351
a person who needs to be rescued.

263
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:10,951
There's somebody in here that we've got to save!

264
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,820
In other words, inside this building there's a "252"...

265
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,920
a person who needs to be rescued.

266
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,520
There's somebody in here that we've got to save!

267
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,520
But, it's unbelievable that

268
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,820
the two would confine somebody in here.

269
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,520
They were both wearing the same kind of clothes, weren't they?

270
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,120
Can you get something like that ready right away?

271
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,220
They were wearing the same overalls to begin with.

272
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,120
So, that even if someone saw them come inside,

273
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
they wouldn't be suspected.

274
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,820
That way they'd look like workers of some kind, you see!

275
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,820
But, if the person who is caught is sending out "252", asking for help,

276
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,220
why not shout it out?

277
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Probably because both his hands and feet are tied,

278
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,520
and his mouth is gagged.

279
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,920
If under those circumstances,

280
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,220
the most you can do is kick something and make a sound, right?

281
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,920
Then, since that sound can't be heard anymore, don't tell me that...

282
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,520
Don't worry! He's still alive!

283
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
If they killed the hostage,

284
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,820
they would've fled before we got to see their faces.

285
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,620
This is probably a kidnap case,

286
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,620
so it would be too risky to kill the hostage before the deal is settled.

287
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,020
I'm sure they probably knocked him out and locked him in somewhere.

288
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,820
Kidnap?

289
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,020
Well, don't worry yourself too much.

290
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,120
All we have to do is report this to the police, and the case is closed!

291
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,620
I guess we should call Officer Takagi who can understand things right away.

292
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,920
Huh?

293
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,620
Conan, your cell phone standby display is

294
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,020
the man at the detective agency!

295
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,920
Yeah, when Pops came back drunk the other day,

296
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,020
he fooled around with this and the standby display's been this way since.

297
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,620
Mine is of me doing sparklers!

298
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,720
I've got it in my school bag, so I'll show it to you later.

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
Mine is Kamen Yaiba!

300
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
How about you, Ai?

301
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
Doc's sleeping face.

302
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,120
Mine is of a stray cat living in the neighborhood

303
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,620
but I seem to have dropped it while playing kick the can.

304
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,120
-Oh, no! -Really!

305
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Be quiet!

306
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,220
I'm going to call the police now.

307
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,720
Where did you say you were going to call?

308
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
What a brat.

309
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,220
He talks to us just for a short while

310
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,620
and sees through the fact that we're not real workers.

311
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,420
Yeah, we were on the verge of being taken in.

312
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,320
You can say that again.

313
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,920
We came here to talk to you in person in order to collect proof.

314
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,120
We've already contacted the police.

315
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,020
We already reported that somebody is confined here!

316
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,920
Right, Officer Takagi?

317
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,020
What?

318
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,420
Oh, come on.

319
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,720
There's no one there!

320
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,720
-Darn it! -They split!

321
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,320
Okay then, we'll just have to catch them one by one!

322
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,520
Yeah, before they contact the police!

323
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,220
Hey, brat, where the heck are you?

324
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,020
Come out here you!

325
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,320
What makes you think they'll come out saying something like that?

326
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,720
If they're not there, they're in another room!

327
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,520
We better hurry, before they get us in trouble!

328
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,720
Yeah.

329
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,820
When in a fix, there's no place better than behind the door.

330
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,120
Now, hurry!

331
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,220
Okay, I'll call the police now.

332
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Oh, no!

333
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,620
You guys go down the stairs and flee outside!

334
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,720
I'll be right behind you!

335
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
Okay!

336
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,720
You brat! Found you!

337
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
Before that...

338
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,620
First, I'll get this one!

339
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Where's the brat?

340
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,620
What was that?

341
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,520
The door's dented.

342
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,220
Hey, look.

343
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,620
The brat's passed out.

344
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,120
I don't know what's happening but we're sure in luck.

345
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,020
Let's tie him up with masking tape and lock him up some place.

346
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,420
Yeah!

347
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,320
This brat seemed to be the smartest

348
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,920
and the one we would've had a tough time with.

349
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,820
Hey! The shutter's closed!

350
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,520
It won't open!

351
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
No joke!

352
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,320
It seems that the two kept in mind

353
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,320
the fact that we may flee before they came to get us and prepared for it.

354
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,520
Where's Conan?

355
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,020
He said he'd be right behind us, and yet...

356
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Maybe Conan fell prey to the hands of the two men.

357
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,520
-What? -What?

358
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,220
We would inevitably have to come down

359
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,620
to the first floor here to get outside.

360
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,620
It's for sure that they'll be coming after us in a matter of time.

361
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,620
Let's hurry and call the police then.

362
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,520
I could call them, but...

363
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
before we finish explaining what's going on,

364
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,420
they may come and take the cell phone away.

365
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,920
Then, they'll explain to the police

366
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,620
that they were playing a police game or something and hang up.

367
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,720
In order to contact the police calmly,

368
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,020
we would have to pass them by one more time.

369
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,820
But, how?

370
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,220
Let's crack the window and go outside!

371
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,520
Impossible.

372
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
The windows are all blocked off

373
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,220
and the glass all have steel wires in them

374
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
and we couldn't possibly crack them.

375
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,020
Then, just what do we do?

376
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,220
Well, how about this?

377
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Hey. Maybe we've already been reported?

378
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Don't worry!

379
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
We can talk them out of whatever the kid said.

380
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,020
The bad people are here!

381
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,620
Don't dare come out everybody!

382
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,720
Does she think she's hiding or what?

383
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,620
I'll catch that brown-haired girl!

384
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,020
You go get the kids behind the pillar!

385
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,120
Yeah!

386
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
No, stay away!

387
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,720
Stay still!

388
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,120
Hey!

389
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Hey! Only the school bags are here!

390
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:50,853
Don't tell me that brat used herself and the school bags as decoys

391
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:54,153
and let the other brats who were hiding elsewhere get away.

392
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:01,753
Darn!

393
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,653
If they flee upwards, it'll be tough looking for them!

394
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:06,653
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

395
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:09,153
-Call the police, the police! -Hurry!

396
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,453
It's calling now...

397
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:14,853
Hey brats! Can you hear me?

398
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:17,253
If you dare call the police,

399
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:22,353
the brown-haired girl and boy with glasses are going to die! You get that?

400
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,553
What?

401
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,953
Yes! 911...

402
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:29,153
"Calling" -Is something wrong? Is it an accident?

403
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:32,953
Hello?

404
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,553
What on earth am I supposed to do?

405
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,860
Next Conans Hint:

406
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,800
"Standby display of a cell phone"

407
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,460
I will protect you, Ai!

408
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,980
Unlike someone else I know, you're so courageous.
