1
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:07,502
So, you like tennis?

2
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:10,902
Oh, yes! It's quite thrilling!

3
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:13,993
Thrilling you say? Lucky you.

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,302
Well, you can expect a greater thrill soon.

5
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,602
What?

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,502
A person is about to be murdered,

7
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:26,005
somewhere in London...

8
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,802
Right before your eyes.

9
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,702
Tell Scotland Yard

10
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:35,302
that's my revelation.

11
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:40,702
If it doesn't make sense, go to Holmes.

12
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:44,023
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

13
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,025
You must be true to yourself.

14
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:48,027
Conan Edogawa is cornered.

15
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,029
Ran can't find out about this!

16
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,702
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,602
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:56,035
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,229
We end up going to London

20
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,141
because of a coincidental encounter with

21
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:45,329
an English woman called Diana, who invites us over.

22
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,329
Of course I can't leave the country as Conan Edogawa,

23
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,129
so I returned to being Shinichi Kudo temporarily

24
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,929
using the drug that Ai gave me,

25
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,729
and headed for London separate from Ran and Pops.

26
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,161
The sanctuary of Sherlock Holmes, the one I adore.

27
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,829
I've got so many places I want to go to that I'm in a fix!

28
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,929
But, waiting for us there

29
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,929
was the premonition of a gravely serious crime.

30
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:17,429
Apollo, the little brother of a famous tennis player, Minerva Grass

31
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,177
was given a piece of paper with a mysterious code

32
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,529
written on it by a suspicious man.

33
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:23,829
Along with the words, "Someone will die right before your eyes"...

34
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:31,029
on the piece of paper were mysterious coded sentences.

35
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,929
"I will awake at the loud sound of the ringing bell."

36
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:39,829
"I'm a long nosed wizard that lives in a castle."

37
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,529
"I fill myself up with boiled eggs as cold as a corpse."

38
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:48,729
"All I need to do now is bite on a whole pickle."

39
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:53,229
"That's right, I have to order a cake for celebration."

40
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,729
"The sound of the bell stirs up hate in me."

41
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,529
"Finish everything off,"

42
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,229
"stab and pierce the white back with two swords."

43
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:05,929
What is the man trying to relay, anyway?

44
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,629
I went on behalf of Apollo

45
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,829
and delivered the piece of paper to Scotland Yard.

46
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,929
There we found out that a lot of other children

47
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,129
had also received the same coded sentences.

48
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:21,429
Somebody's going to die in front of all these children.

49
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,629
Don't tell me

50
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,929
this is a coded advanced warning of a massacre?

51
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:34,253
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Love is 0)"

52
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,129
The Great Britain Museum.

53
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,629
The Buckingham Palace.

54
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,229
Hyde Park.

55
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,029
Well...

56
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,281
We tried going to places where a crowd of people would gather, but...

57
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,029
There were no suspicious places.

58
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,029
There was no person passing out strange leaflets either.

59
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,529
Well, it was good that we could take a city tour of London, though.

60
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,329
Don't be silly!

61
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,929
I was concentrating on finding suspicious characters

62
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:19,329
that I didn't enjoy touring at all!

63
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,629
My God.

64
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:23,529
I'll go get us something to drink, so you wait here!

65
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,929
Okay.

66
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,846
A code...

67
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:33,562
I tried taking a picture of it with my cell phone too, but...

68
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:37,362
It's all Greek to me.

69
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,162
But I'm sure that Shinichi would be able to solve it.

70
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,762
I'd like to call him and ask him for advice,

71
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,325
but I wonder if I should.

72
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:49,962
What's with you, Shinichi, you punk!

73
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:54,333
I hung up on him after shouting at him.

74
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,077
But...

75
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:58,796
I guess it's understandable that he would be in a bad mood.

76
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:00,996
I'm sure it sounded like I was bragging

77
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:02,341
about coming to the land that he adores

78
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,896
all by myself without him.

79
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,896
How stupid of me.

80
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,096
To get carried away all by myself...

81
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,896
I went as far as to check something like this

82
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,353
on the net and made it, and yet...

83
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,296
I'm really... stupid.

84
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,296
Love hurts, doesn't it?

85
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:31,796
Doesn't it?

86
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:33,896
Well, no...

87
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:37,196
Yes, something like that.

88
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,996
You can't ask him for advice, then.

89
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:44,383
He's not an expert in that field, I'm afraid.

90
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,796
-Who is he? -Up there.

91
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:56,096
Sherlock Holmes!

92
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:58,397
I see!

93
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:02,401
I came back to Baker Street again without being aware.

94
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:05,396
Oh, you're Japanese?

95
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,996
Yes.

96
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:11,596
-Right. -How nostalgic, the Japanese language.

97
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:14,796
I used to live in Japan, too.

98
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,696
Because my mother underwent eye surgery in Japan,

99
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:21,496
and was hospitalized there for a while.

100
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:24,423
Are you by any chance...

101
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,896
Ms. Minerva Grass?

102
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:28,696
The tennis player!

103
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:29,896
If people start making a fuss,

104
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,796
I won't be able to come here anymore!

105
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,896
Do you come here often?

106
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,096
Yes.

107
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:45,096
For sure before competing in the Wimbledon finals.

108
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:47,096
In order to draw on Holmes' powers of observation

109
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:50,449
and discernment to lead me to victory.

110
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,451
You like Holmes, don't you?

111
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:55,996
Well, I guess I was strongly influenced by my mother.

112
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:59,796
My father is German, but my mother is English.

113
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:02,461
She's a Sherlockian through and through.

114
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,463
My mother lost her vision,

115
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:08,467
so now she can only read Conan Doyle in Braille, though.

116
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,196
And 8 years ago,

117
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,496
my father died in a traffic accident

118
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:15,196
along with my sister who was 6 years younger than me.

119
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,396
Minerva!

120
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:20,896
When my father died,

121
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:23,596
the one who was in my mother's stomach was Apollo, over there!

122
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:27,996
So, at present, I'm the breadwinner for the Grass family!

123
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:30,489
I thought he was still around here

124
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,491
because he hadn't called.

125
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,296
But he isn't.

126
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,896
Oh, that's too bad.

127
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:40,796
He really a disciple of Holmes!

128
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,501
Wait.

129
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:45,596
How did you know?

130
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:48,796
That I was troubled over love?

131
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:54,513
Because you had the same look on your face

132
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:59,296
that I saw in the mirror of myself some time ago.

133
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,521
Which means, that you're also troubled over love?

134
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,796
But I'm not troubled anymore.

135
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,596
Like Holmes also says,

136
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:10,529
love is an emotional thing.

137
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,296
It is does not go hand in hand with calm, logical thinking,

138
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,796
that I respect above all things.

139
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:21,296
You know, the same goes for tennis.

140
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:24,296
Love is 0 (Zero).

141
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,545
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

142
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
the end result is miserable defeat.

143
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:36,555
Wrong!

144
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:39,296
This isn't the place!

145
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,796
This isn't it, either!

146
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:44,563
Darn it!

147
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:49,196
There is no place near a castle where there are two clock shops,

148
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,996
a food shop and cake shop,

149
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:54,573
along with a shop that sells weapons cluttered together!

150
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:58,577
Hey, hey. It's already 8:00 at night!

151
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,596
Just what're you talking about?

152
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:02,581
It's still this bright.

153
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,596
I see!

154
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:06,596
At this time of season, the vicinity of London

155
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:09,696
doesn't get dark until after 9:00 at night.

156
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,596
Ran, what's up?

157
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,896
What do you mean, what's up?

158
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:21,496
I told you that we were going to have dinner

159
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,196
at the hotel restaurant at 8:00, didn't I?

160
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:27,996
I'm sorry, Doc and I were absorbed

161
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,996
in trying to decipher the code, so...

162
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,296
We've already started eating, you know!

163
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:36,296
Then, Doc and I'll pass up the dinner.

164
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:38,896
We can go get some fish and chips around here.

165
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,096
Hey, hey.

166
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:42,196
Hey, where are you anyway?

167
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:44,896
I wonder where this is.

168
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,896
Isn't there any landmarks or something nearby?

169
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,996
Let's see...

170
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:52,631
There's a big Ferris Wheel right nearby!

171
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,196
The London Eye!

172
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,096
So, that's the story.

173
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,496
Wait...

174
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,696
London Eye, my foot!

175
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:08,647
We're near the Big Ben!

176
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,649
I had no choice, did I?

177
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,896
If she comes to get us,

178
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:15,196
we'll have to quit investigating on this dangerous code.

179
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:18,657
But I think Ran will be worried.

180
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,596
Don't worry! We'll be back at the hotel

181
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,296
about the time they finish having dinner!

182
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,096
May I be excused?

183
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,696
I'll call my company.

184
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:32,396
Oh, you will.

185
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:36,096
Wait here! I'll go get the two and bring them here!

186
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,677
What?

187
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,096
Hey!

188
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:46,296
Now, can I ask about your successful adventures?

189
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,396
Mr. Sleeping Detective.

190
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:53,196
What speaking now?

191
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:58,196
As you can see, I've brought a party of friends tonight.

192
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:02,096
Since I learned you're a famous detective in Japan...

193
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,596
Now, start your story, okay?

194
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:08,196
Okay.

195
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,711
The London Eye...

196
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,196
It's quite a distance away.

197
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,715
I've got no choice.

198
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,196
I'll run over there.

199
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,719
It's not far enough to take a cab besides.

200
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,723
I tell you, that Conan,

201
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,396
to be absorbed in making deductions

202
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,096
to the point of forgetting that he's hungry.

203
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,696
He just like...

204
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:34,196
He's just like...

205
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:36,196
Holmes said,

206
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:39,796
that your brain works better on an empty stomach!

207
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:48,296
I guess I'll try calling Shinichi after all.

208
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:52,296
It really looks like an urgent code in need of deciphering.

209
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:55,896
But I just can't make myself call him.

210
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:59,296
But...

211
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:01,496
In other words,

212
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:04,763
a lot of people may be killed at once, right?

213
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:12,771
This code may not be

214
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:17,596
indicating a store that's selling things.

215
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,777
Yeah.

216
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,779
The first line says,

217
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:24,783
"I will awake with the sound of the bell ringing."

218
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:25,996
The next goes,

219
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:29,496
"I am a long nosed wizard that lives in a castle."

220
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:34,793
"I fill my stomach up with boiled eggs as cold as a corpse."

221
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:40,596
"All I have to do is bite on a whole pickle to finish it off."

222
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:46,096
"That's right, I've got to order a cake for celebration."

223
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:50,296
"The sound of the bell ringing stirs up hate in me."

224
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:55,396
And finally, it says, "Finish everything off.

225
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:58,817
Stab and pierce the white back with two swords."

226
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:01,996
It all sounds totally Greek to me.

227
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:04,823
If I can only decipher the first line

228
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,196
that reads, "The sound of the ringing bell",

229
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,296
then maybe it would serve as a clue.

230
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,496
It's Ran again.

231
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:17,796
Let me concentrate on the code.

232
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,096
Hello?

233
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,896
Sorry, Shinichi?

234
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:23,796
It's me.

235
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,845
Oh no! It's Shinichi's cell phone!

236
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,396
You were still sleeping, weren't you?

237
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:31,196
Since it's 5:00 in the morning yet in Japan, right?

238
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:33,696
No, I was awake.

239
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,496
I was thinking something over.

240
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,855
I'm sorry about a while ago

241
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:40,396
for shouting at you and hanging up the phone.

242
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,496
I'm here in the land that you always wanted to come to

243
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,896
and got carried away all by myself.

244
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,996
It sounded as if I was just bragging.

245
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:50,296
It didn't really bother me!

246
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,871
My hands were really tied back then.

247
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:56,096
I see. I'm sorry!

248
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:00,096
I have a code that I'd like you to decipher.

249
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:05,596
If it's that code, Conan the kid forwarded it to me.

250
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,896
The fact is, I stayed up all night thinking about that code.

251
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:15,396
But I'm stuck at the part, "The ringing bell..."

252
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,896
The ringing!

253
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,596
Sound of the bell.

254
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,328
I get it. It's Big Ben! Big Ben!

255
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:50,328
-Huh? -You can hear it, can't you?

256
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:52,928
The chime of this Big Ben.

257
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:56,328
This is what the ringing sound of the bell is indicating!

258
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:58,528
This Big Ben...

259
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:03,328
Hey, Shinichi, just what is the meaning of this?

260
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,628
Well...

261
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:06,945
Don't tell me you're here? In London?

262
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:12,428
On TV, there's a live broadcast of London airing just now.

263
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:15,528
You're here, aren't you?

264
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:19,228
Well, another call's coming in! See you then!

265
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:26,728
I see.

266
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:29,328
That's why he acted so indifferent

267
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:30,428
and wanted to hang up right away acting as if

268
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:32,971
I got him at the wrong time when I called him last.

269
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,628
It was because he's here in London!

270
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,983
Oh no! Ran's coming!

271
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:50,028
Hey, we're supposed to be near the London Eye, you know?

272
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:53,328
At any rate...

273
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,628
Let's get out of here.

274
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:56,995
I guess so!

275
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,828
Well, that's the way I threw the culprit over

276
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:08,028
using the Judo technique of one arm shoulder throw.

277
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,828
Oh, baritsu!

278
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,728
Baritsu? No, no. Judo!

279
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,628
That's baritsu.

280
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:19,017
Which Holmes performed on Professor Moriarty when they fell!

281
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,728
Mastering baritsu means you're a brilliant detective!

282
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:25,023
I don't know what's going on.

283
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:29,828
Oh, yes! I am strong detective!

284
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,328
I thought it was funny

285
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:39,037
that Shinichi didn't sound envious!

286
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,039
I won't let him get away, never!

287
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,128
Excuse me.

288
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:50,028
Have you seen a Japanese boy?

289
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,528
Yes, I have!

290
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,528
I do believe he was rushing to the bridge over there.

291
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:59,628
No joke. You mean the bridge I just crossed?

292
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,928
He crossed the other side on the opposite side.

293
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,067
Shinichi!

294
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,128
Oh no!

295
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:13,528
We've got to spend time somewhere

296
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:15,073
or she'll catch up with us!

297
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,075
Two Japanese together will stand out!

298
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,077
Once we cross the bridge, let's split up and flee!

299
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,079
I guess so!

300
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,528
Hey. Are you okay?

301
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,728
That hurts.

302
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:32,028
The lid for this drain came off.

303
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,128
There're some words beside the drainage.

304
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:41,099
The Valley of Fear.

305
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,128
It's one of the titles of Holmes' story.

306
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,728
Come on, hurry!

307
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,328
Yeah.

308
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,528
Why was it in a place like that?

309
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:03,628
Did you see a Japanese boy?

310
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:06,528
Yes, I did. I saw him running over there!

311
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,129
Excuse me!

312
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:13,528
Excuse me!

313
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,128
Excuse me!

314
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,528
I just passed him.

315
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,628
Excuse me!

316
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:26,928
Have you seen a Japanese boy?

317
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,147
That boy has...

318
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,628
run into a phone booth just now.

319
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:34,928
Thanks.

320
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:36,928
Oh no!

321
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,528
If she finds me now,

322
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:42,128
she'll find out that I'm Shinichi!

323
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:50,828
Darn it! I've got no choice but to!

324
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,528
Shinichi.

325
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:01,179
You can't run away from me anymore.

326
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,828
You'd better have a good explanation.

327
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,828
Shinichi!

328
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:32,228
Explanation, nothing.

329
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:35,228
It just so happened I came here to London too.

330
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,728
Hey, hey. Don't tell me you drank the antidote

331
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,828
that you were going to drink upon departure?

332
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,928
Then, why'd you run away?

333
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:47,228
That's well...

334
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:51,528
I missed the chance to tell you about it,

335
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:53,928
so I felt sort of uncomfortable.

336
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:56,528
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:59,228
You had a lot of chances to tell me, didn't you?

338
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:00,828
So that's...

339
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:03,028
So stupid.

340
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,728
How stupid of me.

341
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,028
Getting carried away all by myself.

342
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:10,228
I checked on a lot of things

343
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,528
and worried more than I could handle.

344
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:16,028
I feel so stupid!

345
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:20,628
It's just like she said.

346
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:22,528
Love is 0.

347
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,928
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

348
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:25,828
the result is miserable defeat.

349
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,328
Just what're you talking about?

350
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,269
Minerva Grass said so!

351
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,271
Minerva Grass, you mean...

352
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,128
You met the Grass Queen?

353
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,828
I met her! On Baker Street!

354
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:39,928
Does it bug you?

355
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,628
Baker Street?

356
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:44,628
Wasn't there a child nearby then?

357
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,928
Yes, there was.

358
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:48,228
She said he was her younger brother.

359
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:50,928
He... Didn't that boy say anything?

360
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:53,628
Like, he remembered something so he came back?

361
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,828
Hey, cool head.

362
00:21:57,828 --> 00:22:00,228
Cool head?

363
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:02,128
Don't you get it?

364
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:04,628
You're a detective, aren't you?

365
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:05,628
If you're a detective,

366
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:08,028
why don't you deduce how I'm feeling inside?

367
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,828
Idiot!

368
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,428
Hey, hold it!

369
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:13,311
Ran!

370
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:16,528
I'm telling you, wait!

371
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:21,319
Ran!

372
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

373
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,423
"Alphabet"

374
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,514
Oh no! Ran looks really angered.

375
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,420
If it were an "anchor", we could sink it into the water, but with anger...
