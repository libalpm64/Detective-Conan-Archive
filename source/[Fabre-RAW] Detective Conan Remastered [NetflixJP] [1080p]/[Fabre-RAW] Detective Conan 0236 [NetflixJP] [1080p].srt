1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,290
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,490
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,190
Today's episode takes place in Shirahama of Southern Kishu.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,090
The footprints of crime on a white sand beach.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,490
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,750
Here!

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,050
There you go.

12
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,350
Dad, let's go check out souvenirs at the waiting room!

13
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,550
We don't have to go look for souvenirs just yet, do we?

14
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,950
How cute!

15
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,850
Look! It's Sour Boy.

16
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,250
Kishu is a region famous for sour plums!

17
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,850
I'm going to buy some on my way home.

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,550
What's so cute about a sour looking guy like this?

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,650
You can say that again.

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,250
So, where are we going first?

21
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,550
Here.

22
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,250
Nanboukumakusunoki?

23
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,050
No, it's read Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall.

24
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,350
He's a world famous botanist who was born In Wakayama Prefecture,

25
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,350
especially known for his research of plants and fungi.

26
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,350
Oh, so such a great researcher existed.

27
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,850
I'd advise you to study a bit before traveling.

28
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,450
"Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall"

29
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,850
Why don't you stop by for a meal here?

30
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,850
The crawfish here is good.

31
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,450
What do you think, dad?

32
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,650
It's still too early.

33
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,150
Let's go check out the memorial hall first.

34
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,950
"Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall Entrance"

35
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,050
The road's closed on this side.

36
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,150
This way, Conan!

37
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,650
Okay!

38
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,650
"Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall"

39
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,250
"Shirahama"

40
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,450
The sand is really fine and white!

41
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,050
I wonder why is it so white?

42
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,350
I once heard that the secret of its whiteness

43
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,350
is due 90% silicate quartz sand.

44
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,150
Goodness. He sure is knowledgeable of trivials.

45
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,450
I want to take this sand home!

46
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,250
You know, like fill it up in a bottle like the star sand

47
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,350
and take it with me.

48
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,850
What a girlish taste you got.

49
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,650
You were looking at a weird looking key holder

50
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,450
back at the station too, weren't you?

51
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,950
The one with sour pickled plums attached to it.

52
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,350
But it's so cute!

53
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,350
You fool! Only brats like things like that!

54
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,850
Brats?

55
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,950
Excuse me, but aren't you Mr. Mouri?

56
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,950
-Yes. -I thought so!

57
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,350
I'm a fan of yours!

58
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,650
This is awesome!

59
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,450
I'd like to take pictures of you.

60
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,050
Do you know him, Fuji?

61
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,350
What a beauty!

62
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,950
He's the renowned detective

63
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,050
that you're all familiar with, Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

64
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,450
Ran, could you please take a picture of us two?

65
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,850
Gosh.

66
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,750
Here goes!

67
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,450
By the way, did you come here to investigate a case or something?

68
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,150
No, it's just a plain sightseeing tour.

69
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,850
We drew a winning raffle at the shopping arcade.

70
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,850
Idiot! Be quiet!

71
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,050
Are you all students?

72
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,650
Yes, we're seniors at Naniwa Medical University.

73
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,250
So, you're doctors in the making!

74
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,950
Let me introduce everyone, then.

75
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,550
The girl who is next to you

76
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,550
is the queen of our group, Maki Shinjou.

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,350
Cut it out, Fuji.

78
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,450
Next to her is the gigolo, Tatsuhiko Yura.

79
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,450
This is our Madonna, Madoka Mitsui.

80
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,750
How do you do?

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,050
She is our whiz kid, Kanako Mihara.

82
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,550
Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,450
And I'm the clown of the group, Kota Fuji!

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,550
The three here belong to the art club,

85
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,350
and since Maki suggested that

86
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,950
we take a nature sketching trip, we've all decided to come.

87
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,550
I guess you could call it a pastime for Ms. Little Richie.

88
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,650
Talk about grateful.

89
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,450
She paid for the hotel, train tickets and rent-a-car fee as well.

90
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,450
Yura! You've got no class, talking like that!

91
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,850
It's okay.

92
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,150
I broke up with her

93
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,250
because I didn't like just what she's doing for all of us.

94
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,150
I mean, she spends several thousand yen a month

95
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,050
just on cosmetics.

96
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,150
She has them sent from Paris every time a new product comes out.

97
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,450
On the contrary, Madoka has no money like me

98
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,850
and doesn't look down on me.

99
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,450
Her childishness is a fly in the ointment, though.

100
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,550
Well, aren't you lucky

101
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,550
having found yourself a cutie-pie to go around with?

102
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,650
It doesn't bother me a bit.

103
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,450
Hey, hey.

104
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,450
I'm thirsty.

105
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,050
Can you go get me something to drink, Kanako?

106
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,250
No way!

107
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,150
Go get it yourself!

108
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,750
I've decided to not listen to your beck and calls anymore!

109
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,350
Kanako.

110
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,150
It's true that thanks to you, I was able to made it to college

111
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,650
since you taught me Mathematics

112
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,850
that wasn't my cup of tea during high school.

113
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,050
And I really appreciate what you did back then.

114
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,850
But will you stop bossing me around

115
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,750
harping on how grateful I should be to you?

116
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,150
I didn't mean to be bossing you around.

117
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,250
Now, now.

118
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,250
We've all come on this trip together,

119
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,850
so why don't we just all go ahead and have a good time?

120
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,750
I'll go get the drinks.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,300
Right,

122
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,400
maybe I'll have Fuji do things for me

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,100
instead of Kanako from now on.

124
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I wonder who it was

125
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,700
that fainted during practical dissection practice

126
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,800
and was saved by me?

127
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,000
So, something like that happened to you?

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,700
Oh, come on!

129
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,100
You promised that you'd keep that a secret.

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,600
Well, I'm going to get the drinks, so wait for me.

131
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,000
Mr. Mouri, what are your plans after this?

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,100
Let's see...

133
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,800
We're going to the Shirahama Energy Land right over there.

134
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,700
Then, we'll be going to the Undersea Observation Tower

135
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,500
and go around to Sandanbeki.

136
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,900
And finally watch the sunset from Senjujiki.

137
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
What about tomorrow?

138
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,300
We've thinking of going to Adventure World from morning.

139
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,700
Would you like to come along with us, Maki?

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,100
It's okay. Because we have other plans.

141
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,300
And where are you staying?

142
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,900
At the Shinyuzaki Hotel.

143
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,600
I see.

144
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,600
Dad, we'd better get going.

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,300
Yes, I guess so.

146
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,900
I guess we'll be going, then.

147
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Have a nice trip.

148
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Please enjoy yourselves!

149
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,000
You can't tell if they're getting along or not, right?

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,100
Well, when you're young, anything can be complicated.

151
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,900
"Sandanbeki" -It's amazing!

152
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,700
It's really a bold sheer cliff!

153
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,300
It seems that we can go way over that side.

154
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,900
I'm not going!

155
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
No way!

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,400
Then, why don't we go tour the caves?

157
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
It seems we can go down

158
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
using the elevator from of a temple that building.

159
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
And after that, we get to watch the sunset at Senjujiki, right?

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,900
Yes! I'm sure that it'll be super beautiful!

161
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
"Senjujiki"

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,700
What a scenic masterpiece!

163
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm sure glad we came.

164
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,500
Yes, it was worth coming even if it was only to see this sunset.

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
Mr. Mouri.

166
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Maki!

167
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,400
Did you come to watch the sunset, too?

168
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,300
Yes, since we haven't seen the view of the sunset here yet.

169
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,200
By the way, Mr. Mouri, do you like to drink?

170
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,700
Yes! I like it very much!

171
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,000
If so, why not stop over at Toretore Market

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,900
before going to Adventure World tomorrow?

173
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Toretore Market?

174
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,800
Aside from fresh seafood,

175
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,100
they have a whole line of marvellous locally brewed sake.

176
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,300
Locally brewed sake?

177
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,700
You can send it home by courier service, too.

178
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I've also written the bus route to the market from Shinyuzaku.

179
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,600
There is a bus stop called Bus Depot near Toretore Market.

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
There is no bus that goes directly

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,500
from Toretore Market to Adventure World,

182
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,000
and you'll have to get off once at Shirahama,

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,900
but it shouldn't take that long.

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,400
Thank you so much for your kindness!

185
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,500
We'll visit there for sure!

186
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,700
-Goodbye, then. -Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness!

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,700
Thank you so very much!

188
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,800
It seemed as if Maki came all the way here

189
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,500
just to give us information about the market, didn't it?

190
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,700
I guess she's just a kind person.

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,500
"The next day"

192
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,900
"Shinahama"

193
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,800
"Sandanbeki"

194
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,700
"Adventure World"

195
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,600
"Toretore Market"

196
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,200
The bus for Adventure World is bus number three.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
The next bus to Adventure World is at 10:15 am.

198
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,400
We still have about 20 minutes to go.

199
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,300
Maybe we should go walking around the area.

200
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
What's wrong, Conan?

201
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,000
I felt like someone was watching me.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,700
I guess it's just my imagination though.

203
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,700
If you want it so badly, why don't you just buy it now?

204
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,400
-It's okay. -Hey.

205
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,900
Let's go take a look in the souvenir shop outside, too.

206
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,100
Let's go, Conan.

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,800
We've only got 7 to 8 minutes left, so we'd better get going.

208
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Would you mind if I stop over at the store of the station?

209
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
What? We don't have time, you know.

210
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,700
Hurry it up, okay?

211
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
So, you're going to buy it after all.

212
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,900
Not again.

213
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,000
It's just as if someone is watching me.

214
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,900
-This please. -Okay.

215
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,200
Hey, hurry up, the bus is going to leave!

216
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,600
Only one more left?

217
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Somebody else beside Ran has bought it.

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,700
Thank you very much.

219
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,050
Maki!

220
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,650
Maki!

221
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,850
Thanks again!

222
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,650
Be careful!

223
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,750
Conan, that bus is headed for Sandanbeki!

224
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,960
"Adventure World"

225
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,700
Nice shot!

226
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,510
Conan, wave your hand.

227
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,010
I'm fine.

228
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,210
He's only a kid and yet he's embarrassed.

229
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,310
Isn't that you, Mr. Mouri?

230
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,110
I didn't think that I'd run into you here.

231
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,210
You're...

232
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,610
Fuji! Kota Fuji!

233
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,710
So, you've come here.

234
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,710
Is everyone else here, too?

235
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,710
No. The three went out to sketch from morning,

236
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,310
and Maki was saying that she was going to go driving until sundown.

237
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:11,010
I saw her around 10 am sharp at Shirahama Station!

238
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,710
Oh, I see.

239
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,010
-Hey, over that side! -Let's go and see!

240
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,510
That's a laptop, right?

241
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,510
Do you always carry it around with you?

242
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,510
Yes, that's why Yura call me a computer freak.

243
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,610
Huh? What was that?

244
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,410
Oh, excuse me.

245
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,410
Hello?

246
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,110
What? Calm down and tell me again, Madoka.

247
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,810
What? Maki is dead?

248
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,510
What? Hold on!

249
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,410
Madoka, this is Mouri!

250
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,710
Where and in what condition is the body?

251
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,510
In the bushes at Sandanbeki.

252
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,710
Stabbed in the chest with a knife...

253
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,510
Sandanbeki?

254
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,410
That suspicious looking silhouetted figure

255
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,710
was on board the bus to Sandanbeki.

256
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,210
Darn it!

257
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,710
I'm on the way there along with Mr. Mouri and his family!

258
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,210
Did you called the police?

259
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,310
Did you tell Yura and Kanako?

260
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,410
Not yet?

261
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,710
Okay! I'll inform them, then.

262
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,310
Hey, didn't we just go pass the entrance of Sandanbeki?

263
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,910
Madoka is somewhere far inside.

264
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,710
This way!

265
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,910
-Madoka! -Fuji!

266
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,510
Madoka, where is Maki?

267
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,810
In the bushes over there.

268
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,010
One stab right into her chest.

269
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,510
She probably died on the spot.

270
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,210
Maki's wallet is nowhere in sight.

271
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,210
This is most likely to be a robbery turned murder case.

272
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,310
There are no signs of any struggle in the area.

273
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,910
If so, the murderer could've been an acquaintance.

274
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,210
Strange.

275
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,310
If I remember correctly, Maki's key holder

276
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,010
had the key for the rental car on it, too.

277
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,710
Does that mean that the killer took it along and fled with the car?

278
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,610
But what's with this key holder then?

279
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,110
What is it?

280
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,910
Work gloves?

281
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,810
Why does she have work gloves on her?

282
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,310
Haven't I told you time and again

283
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,710
not to mess around the scene of a crime?

284
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,010
I'm sorry!

285
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,110
Let's wait for the police to come

286
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,210
-for further investigation. -It hurts.

287
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,410
This sand is...

288
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,610
Huh?

289
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,910
This is...

290
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,810
Thank you for waiting.

291
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,910
I'm Oura from Wakayama Prefectural Police Department.

292
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,010
Nice to meet you.

293
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm Ando from the Shirahama East Police Station.

294
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,010
Nice to meet you.

295
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,310
I am honored to be able to work with you,

296
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,910
the renowned detective, Mr. Mouri, on this case.

297
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,710
Please do give us precise advice if needed.

298
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,510
Oh, no.

299
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,410
Cooperating with the police is the duty of any civilian!

300
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,610
I'll help in whatever way I can!

301
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,410
Let me introduce you to the friends of the victim, then.

302
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,310
This Kota Fuji who rushed over here together with us

303
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,610
from Adventure World.

304
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,410
She is Kanako Miyahara who came over here from Engetsu Island.

305
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,010
She is the one who first found the body, Madoka Mitsui.

306
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,610
And he is Tatsuhiko Yura who came here from Shirahama.

307
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,010
Ms. Madoka Mitsui,

308
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,010
please tell us the situation when you found the body.

309
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,610
I heard Beethoven playing.

310
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,910
Beethoven?

311
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,610
I was sketching on the far end of Sandanbeki.

312
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,510
I heard the melody of a cell phone ringing behind me.

313
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,610
So I went towards the bushes where the music was coming from.

314
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,610
I didn't know what to do,

315
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,210
so I called Fuji right away.

316
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,710
I see that Maki was lying on the ground fairly close to you.

317
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,210
Nevertheless, you didn't realize that a crime was being committed?

318
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,910
I was faced in the opposite direction

319
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,410
and the sound of the waves was pretty loud.

320
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,710
But you heard the melody of the cell phone?

321
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,010
Well...

322
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,710
It's only natural.

323
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,410
Electronic sounds like those of cell phone are made to be audible.

324
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,310
Well, I guess so.

325
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,410
Officer Ando, please give us a report on the autopsy.

326
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,210
Yes, sir.

327
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,510
The cause of death is shock by a stab wound.

328
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,810
There are traces of the corpse being moved after death,

329
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,310
and the estimated time of death...

330
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,010
In other words, the time the murder is thought to have been committed.

331
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,110
Judging from the condition of the body,

332
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,110
it's between 9:00 to 11:00 this morning.

333
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,910
No. I'm sure the time the murder was committed

334
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,910
can be narrowed down a bit more.

335
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,110
-What? -We ran into Maki at Shirahama Station.

336
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,010
It was around 10 when we saw her.

337
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,210
What? Are you sure about it?

338
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,210
After bowing to us, she left immediately in her car.

339
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,510
We were going to get on the 10:15 bus headed for Adventure World,

340
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,110
so I'm sure there's no mistake.

341
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,510
Officer Ando.

342
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,310
How long does it take to get from Shirahama Station

343
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,210
to Sandanbeki by car?

344
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,510
Well, since it's the tour season now,

345
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,910
it should take less than 14 minutes.

346
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,610
Let's say it takes about 14 minutes,

347
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,310
so she arrives at Sandanbeki about 10:24.

348
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,110
If she parks the car in the alley closest to the scene of the crime,

349
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,810
it would take her two minutes to get there.

350
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,010
If we assume she was killed immediately,

351
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,910
the time the murder was committed, no matter how early,

352
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,110
it would be around 10:26!

353
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,510
Yes, which means that the time the murder had been committed

354
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,410
is narrowed down to approximately 34 minutes.

355
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,110
By the way, Maki's wallet

356
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,610
seems to have disappeared from among her personal belongings.

357
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,910
Just a few minutes ago,

358
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,410
the car that the victim was thought to have been driving

359
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,510
was found near Sansho Shrine

360
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,710
about three kilometers away from here.

361
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,410
And an empty wallet was found inside the car.

362
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,710
It's Maki's!

363
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,710
So, we've already gotten to the bottom of this case...

364
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,410
Wait!

365
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,360
Was the key of the car found?

366
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,460
The key was in the ignition of the car.

367
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Did you only receive one key from the rental car shop?

368
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
I think so.

369
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,860
I don't think they normally give you two keys, do they?

370
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,060
This is a case of murder-robbery!

371
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
After the killer killed Maki,

372
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,860
the killer stole the car and fled on it,

373
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,560
and abandoned it near Sansho Shrine!

374
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,360
No, murder-robbery is probably just a camouflage.

375
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
It's most likely that this murder was committed

376
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
by an acquaintance of hers.

377
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,860
If so, the murderer is among the people here.

378
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,700
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,280
"Cosmetics"

380
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,500
Have you figured out the killer?

381
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,280
It must be the one that bought Sour Boy!

382
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:41,870
Really?
