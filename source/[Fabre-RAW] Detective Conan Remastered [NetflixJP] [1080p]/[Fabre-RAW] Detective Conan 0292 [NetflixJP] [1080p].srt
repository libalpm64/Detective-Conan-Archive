1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,870
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,670
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,170
An uninhabited island and the bottom of the sea,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,370
Conan and Heiji's theories explode.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,710
A television program pitting the best detectives from the East and West

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,410
brings us along with Heiji Hattori here to Okinawa.

10
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,810
We accompany the filming crew to an uninhabited island

11
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,610
where an unidentified body and a mysterious message is found.

12
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,410
Then a female member of the film crew, Yoshie Taira,

13
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,110
is murdered and a mysterious message is found near her body

14
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,810
then the boat we came on

15
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,810
and the captain disappeared.

16
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,610
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 2)"

17
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,510
What? An anchor

18
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,710
on the bottom of the sea where Miss Taira was diving?

19
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,010
Are you sure about that?

20
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,210
Yeah.

21
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,510
The chain was cut and it was rusty

22
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,410
but it was a ship's anchor.

23
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,810
Maybe it was from that man's ship,

24
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,710
the man who was found dead here a year ago.

25
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,910
Yes, I bet you're right!

26
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,610
He probably got to this island on it

27
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,610
and he decided to wait out the storm in here

28
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,910
but the chain broke and the boat drifted away.

29
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,010
No!

30
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,610
There was a lot of mollusks and sea weed on the anchor,

31
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,910
it must've been down there for at least four or five years.

32
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,710
Four or five years.

33
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,310
It's been about that long, right?

34
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,910
Several incidents happened at the mayor's house around that time.

35
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,610
-Yeah. -What do you mean incidents?

36
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,310
"Noburou Ikema (24), Crew" -The first time was five years ago.

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,510
The mayor's only daughter,

38
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,910
Miss Miyako, was kidnapped.

39
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,310
A year later, a gang of robbers broke into the mayor's home,

40
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,010
they took a gold screen which was a family heirloom.

41
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,110
According to the mayor and his butler who took the call from the robbers,

42
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,210
the kidnappers and the robbers were the same group.

43
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,610
So, what happened to them?

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,510
The mayor refused to pay the ranso and the money for the screen

45
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,710
so they were never caught, and both Miss Miyako

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,910
and the screen were never seen again, or so I've heard.

47
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,110
It was a terrible blow to the mayor

48
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,910
his daughter was kidnapped short! After his wife passed away

49
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,810
and one of his maids was killed by the robbers.

50
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,110
The butler was so scared, he quit.

51
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,210
People started to bad mouth the mayor

52
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,310
saying he was a heartless money monger

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,510
and on top of that, the corpse of a man who starved to death

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,910
was found on this island the mayor owns,

55
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,110
along with that mysterious message.

56
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,010
And now this...

57
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,210
I'm beginning to think the "guso's messenger" really exists.

58
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,410
Hey listen. The words carved on the pillar

59
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,410
didn't they say "The princess lies in A not B",

60
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,510
am I right?

61
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,810
You're right.

62
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,710
Don't you think that the princess might mean the mayor's daughter?

63
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,810
Are you saying she's been killed

64
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,910
and is buried somewhere on this island?

65
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,910
That's right.

66
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,410
She came back as a messenger from the other world

67
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,510
and killed Miss Taira.

68
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,210
If you're afraid of ghosts, you can use that knife.

69
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,310
There's an old legend that women kept a dagger in their mouth

70
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,410
so that that their souls wouldn't be sucked out through their mouth.

71
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,610
And it could be used for self protection.

72
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,410
This is very interesting.

73
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,410
Take a look at this tea cup!

74
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,910
It looks like somebody used it as an ashtray.

75
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,810
There are more than one kind of cigarettes

76
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,210
and the water on the bottom isn't completely dry yet.

77
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,710
Which means that just before we got to this island,

78
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,410
there was another group of people here.

79
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,910
That's right, and there wasn't just one or two of them

80
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,810
they killed a woman

81
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,310
and now they're hiding somewhere on this island.

82
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,810
I'm talking about the messengers of death.

83
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,710
Come on, you're kidding, right?

84
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,710
Are you saying there's a group of killers

85
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,610
on this island?

86
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,710
I'm just saying that it's possible.

87
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,910
They could be watching us from somewhere...

88
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,810
waiting to steal our souls.

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,310
I don't believe it.

90
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,010
Then they might already be inside this house.

91
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,210
That's not possible!

92
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,910
We all checked to make sure nobody was inside, right?

93
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,010
But there're a lot of broken windows in this place.

94
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,610
It'd have been easy to sneak in while we were busy talking.

95
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,910
Then I think we should split up into groups

96
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,610
and search the place one more time.

97
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,410
I agree, it won't help to stay here and panic.

98
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,010
Then Mr. Kume, you and Mr. Ikema and Mr. Daito check the second floor.

99
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,610
Okay.

100
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,710
Mr. Taketomi and we will check the first floor.

101
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,410
Yes, alright.

102
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,810
I mean, you'd be at a disadvantage if you got attacked

103
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,710
since you'd be the only male with two girls to protect.

104
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,910
Huh? You've got to be kidding!

105
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,310
You're the one that they'll be protecting.

106
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,610
No kidding. Really?

107
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,110
-Karate? -Yes.

108
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,710
I took first place in the city competition

109
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,810
I hold a second rank in aikido.

110
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,210
Impressive, I feel very safe...

111
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,710
Yes. Thank you.

112
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,210
If we come across any bad guys, you can ave them to us!

113
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,210
We made the right decision making him join us.

114
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,610
Yeah, he looked the weakest.

115
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,110
Okay, Heiji.

116
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,110
This is the last room.

117
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,110
Don't keep us in suspense, open it up!

118
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,610
Aybe it wasn't a good idea after all...

119
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,910
Is anybody in here?

120
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,710
Hey...

121
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,410
No body...

122
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,210
seems to be inside.

123
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,910
I think you're right.

124
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,410
This room's not like the others, it's really big.

125
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,710
I think the mayor's wife used this room,

126
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,210
see, there's a picture of them together.

127
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,110
It's really corroded...

128
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,110
Now, look what you did, Heiji.

129
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,210
There's two pictures in here.

130
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,510
What is this? There's a picture taken with a young girl.

131
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,210
Do you think the mayor was having an affair with her?

132
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,310
No, you're wrong.

133
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,710
That's Miss Miyako, the mayor's only daughter.

134
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,710
She looked just like her mother, they were both

135
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,910
fair skinned and good natured, everyone liked her

136
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,810
when she was kidnapped five years ago

137
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,810
while still attending junior college and then never found.

138
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,210
Everyone was shocked.

139
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,210
Didn't you say you work for a television station in Kyushu?

140
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,710
How do you know so much then?

141
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:18,210
Yoshiko Matsumoto the maid that worked for the mayor is my cousin.

142
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,710
She used to talk about them all the time.

143
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,510
That maid, is she the one...

144
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,910
Who was killed during the robbery.

145
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,110
Yes, one of the robbers killed her during the robbery four years ago.

146
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,310
Speaking of family, Ikema told me

147
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,010
his mother and the mayor's wife were sisters

148
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,110
so that makes him and Miyako cousins.

149
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,610
This castle in the back ground of the picture,

150
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,110
I've never seen it before, which castle is it?

151
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,710
Oh, that's not a castle, that's the mayor's house.

152
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,910
It's a huge mansion.

153
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,010
According to my cousin, when the house was first built,

154
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,510
Miss Miyako was still little and she was so happy.

155
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,310
She said she felt like a princess in a castle.

156
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,710
A princess...

157
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,710
In a castle.

158
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,810
That settles it, the princess carved on that pillar really is...

159
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,510
Miss Miyako?

160
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,410
Speaking of strange messages, there's some here, too.

161
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,610
What?

162
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,710
I think they were written by Miyako.

163
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,210
What?

164
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,210
See, there's three.

165
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,810
You're right, it looks it was written with crayons.

166
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,910
The top one says "Chiyoni",

167
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,310
20 centimeters below that it says "Kachan",

168
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,710
and on the very bottom, it says "me".

169
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,610
Judging by all the lines near the word "me",

170
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,010
I'd say she was comparing heights with someone when she was little.

171
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,010
That's a relief, you had me scared there for awhile.

172
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,810
I know "Kachan" means mother,

173
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,110
but for a well bred young lady, she certainly uses common language.

174
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,310
No. I don't think she meant mother...

175
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,310
What?

176
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,510
Take a look!

177
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,710
They're very faint but you can still make out some words

178
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,910
on this door written with the same crayon.

179
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,310
It says "Mama's Room".

180
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,710
You're right!

181
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,510
Then who'd she mean?

182
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,510
Who are these people, "Kachan" and "Chiyoni"?

183
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,510
Beats me.

184
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,810
Maybe they were her friends from school.

185
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,110
I don't think so!

186
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,510
She was still very young when she wrote this,

187
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,110
her friends wouldn't be that tall!

188
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,910
Yes, I see your point...

189
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,210
Those words are written on this door too!

190
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,710
The room over there's Chiyoni's room and this is Kachan's room.

191
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,510
And that's not all, there're strange drawing by the words, too.

192
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,210
Kachan's drawing is a bird.

193
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,910
Chiyoni's drawing looks like an eel.

194
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,710
You know, looking at a little girl's drawings in this dark is kind of...

195
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,210
Creepy.

196
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,510
Well,

197
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,310
seeing as how these two have rooms here on this uninhabited island,

198
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,410
they must've come here with her often.

199
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,110
When the rescue boat comes to take us back to the main island,

200
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,310
I guess we'll just have to go ask the mayor personally about these two.

201
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,110
They may be involved in this murder.

202
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,310
What was that sound?

203
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,210
I think it was Kume...

204
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,110
It came from upstairs, what happened?

205
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,010
It couldn't be the killers.

206
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,110
Darn.

207
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,660
Hey, what's the matter?

208
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,160
Did you find the killer?

209
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,460
No, it's not that.

210
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,160
That guy let out a scream and he fell back inla panic

211
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,660
he saw what was behind the curtain,

212
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,560
this painting.

213
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Look, isn't the model in that painting Miyako?

214
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,060
You're right, it looks just like the girl in the photo.

215
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,160
It was probably done by her mother,

216
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,260
Yoshiko told me she was quite an artist.

217
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,360
Yoshiko?

218
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
Yes, she's my cousin

219
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
and she worked as a maid in the mayor's household.

220
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
I see.

221
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,660
That means that there's four people here who are connected to the mayor.

222
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,860
Did you say four?

223
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Yes, my mother was the mayor's wife's sister,

224
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,560
the director's cousin was the maid,

225
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,060
Kume was Miyako's classmate in elementary, junior high and high school.

226
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,260
And Mr. Daito over there was a childhood friend of the mayor's wife.

227
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,160
Childhood friends?

228
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,060
Yes, when I went to visit Mrs. Kaneshiro's grave last year with my mother,

229
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,160
he was there, too.

230
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,560
My mother asked and he told her they were childhood friends.

231
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
But my mother said she didn't remember him,

232
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,860
so he could've been lying.

233
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,160
I don't blame her.

234
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Their ages were far apart, that's why she didn't remember.

235
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,260
If your mother and Mrs. Kaneshiro were sisters,

236
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,560
then you must've come to this island before, too.

237
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,660
No. I never came to this island, in fact,

238
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,760
I rarely went to the mayor's house to visit.

239
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,260
The reason was, he was a very wealthy man and we felt uncomfortable.

240
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,860
I only saw Miyako a few times when she was very young.

241
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,360
I wonder why Mr. Kume panicked like that

242
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
when he saw her painting though?

243
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,160
Beats me.

244
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Maybe he thought he was seeing her ghost?

245
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,260
There's been gossip that she was killed.

246
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,560
Well, anyway

247
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,660
it doesn't look like anybody suspicious is hiding out in this house,

248
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,460
so let's all just stay together in one room

249
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,960
and wait for the rescue boat.

250
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Don't you think it's taking a little too long?

251
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,960
Yeah.

252
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,160
But you know old Kogoro.

253
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,460
You can bet he's found himself a girl and they've gone out drinking.

254
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,460
The old good for nothing.

255
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,960
What was that?

256
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Maybe it's...

257
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes, I knew it! It's the rescue boat!

258
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,060
We're saved!

259
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,760
Hey, there!

260
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,560
Here, we're over here!

261
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,860
Hey!

262
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,760
Something's wrong with that boat.

263
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,060
Yeah, there're no lights on

264
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,860
and it's not docked right.

265
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
"I'm the 'guso's messenger'."

266
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,560
What a horrible way to die.

267
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,060
The killer used something like a hard pipe and hit him so many times,

268
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,760
even after he died.

269
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,460
How awful.

270
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,660
Then the killer tied his body to the side of the boat

271
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,460
and wrote those words

272
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,360
"I Death's messenger".

273
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,660
Whoever did this really hated him.

274
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,260
Who would do such a thing?

275
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,760
So there is somebody else here.

276
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,960
Somebody besides us is here on the island or in the ocean.

277
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,460
Somebody who enjoys killing is hiding out somewhere!

278
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,260
You're right.

279
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,560
When the boat rammed into the landing,

280
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,860
we were all inside the house.

281
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,160
Whoever piloted this boat is still around here, I'm sure of that.

282
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,260
Yes, that would be the so called "Death's messenger".

283
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,160
No, that's not necessarily true.

284
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,860
Conan.

285
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
I just looked around inside,

286
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,160
there's a teeny tiny thing

287
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,060
that looks like a television by the steering wheel.

288
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,960
I checked the screen and it looks Iike this boat

289
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,460
just went from this landing to the ocean and then came back again!

290
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,560
Oh, I see, it was on auto pilot!

291
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,960
That way, no one has to be steering.

292
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,860
But kid, there're currents in the ocean,

293
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
you wouldn't be able to control

294
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,760
how the boat crashed into the landing by auto pilot.

295
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,560
That's where you're wrong, it doesn't have to be exactly right.

296
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,360
The flow of the current would affect the boat

297
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,760
by about 50 to 100 meters.

298
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
To have the boat come to this side of the island,

299
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,560
all you'd have to do is set the auto pilot to move along the shoreline,

300
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,360
then the boat would move along the reef and crash into the landing.

301
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,560
Look at that. You can see the side of the bottom's scraped.

302
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,460
That proves the boat moved along the reef scraping it.

303
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,560
By using the auto pilot,

304
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,460
anyone would've been able to commit the crime.

305
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,660
No matter what time the boat was set to leave this landing.

306
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,360
So you see, any one of us could have done it.

307
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,660
Are you trying to tell us that...

308
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,660
That the killer is one of us?

309
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
That's right.

310
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,260
When the four of us left the boat to look for Miss Taira,

311
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,460
you said you all left the boat right after us, didn't you?

312
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,660
Well, it would've been possible

313
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,260
for the man who left last to commit the crime.

314
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,860
So who was it?

315
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,060
Not me!

316
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,660
It wasn't me either.

317
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,860
I was the last one to get off the boat.

318
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,660
Then that means you did it...

319
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,560
But any one of you could've come back after I'd gone, right?

320
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,260
And another thing you shouldn't forget, young detective.

321
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,460
When that woman Miss Taira was killed...

322
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,460
That's right, I remember what you said!

323
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,660
About the words in the sand where her body was found,

324
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,860
you said it'd be impossible for us to do it,

325
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,460
since we were on the opposite side of the island.

326
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Yeah, you definitely said that

327
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,860
since the words were written where the last wave of the high tide receded,

328
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,160
they must've been written shortly before we found her

329
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,360
when the tide was low, otherwise, they would've been washed away.

330
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,060
Besides, the words on both scenes were the exact same,

331
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,260
so they were written by the same person, right?

332
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,960
Then the killer couldn't possibly be one of us.

333
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,660
If there was more than one killer,

334
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,760
they might have talked it over and decided to do it the same way.

335
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,360
It may have been part of their plan

336
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,360
to make us suspect each other of the crime.

337
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,360
Well the boat's back now anyway.

338
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,860
That's right. Don't you think it'd be better if we discussed this

339
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,960
after we get back to the main island?

340
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,460
Thing is, while we were taking the captain down,

341
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,660
I looked around the boat and saw that the fuel tank's pretty much empty.

342
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,460
And that's not all.

343
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,560
The radio's been broken and all our things are gone,

344
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,560
which means the killer wants to keep us on this island

345
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,260
and is planning to do something.

346
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
What do you mean...

347
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,760
You mean another murder?

348
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,960
Yes.

349
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
If you don't want to get killed, we better all go back to the house

350
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
and wait for the rescue boat to arrive, that's the only thing we can do.

351
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,460
Good grief, how long do we have to wait for that rescue boat?

352
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,760
Who knows.

353
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,760
Alright Heiji.

354
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,560
We'll see you back there later.

355
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
-Alright. -Be careful!

356
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,960
Don't worry.

357
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,560
Listen, Kudo, something about this isn't right.

358
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,360
I know.

359
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,960
With the first victim Miss Taira,

360
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,560
the killer took the time to fold her arms neatly over her chest

361
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,060
and close her eyes.

362
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,760
But the second victim, the captain, was beaten to death.

363
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,260
Their killers might've been different but still,

364
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,560
the methods are drastically different.

365
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Another thing bothers me,

366
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,260
the way Miss Taira and the captain behaved before they were killed.

367
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,360
Yeah, she deliberately chose to dive

368
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,360
where the current was fast, knowing how dangerous it was.

369
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,960
And the captain circled around the island until the very last minute.

370
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,960
And there was seabed exploratory equipment on board too,

371
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,860
he must've been searching for something.

372
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,760
And it was probably attached to that anchor I found.

373
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,860
But what was it?

374
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,460
But besides that, Kudo.

375
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,160
Remember the words written on the back of the chairs

376
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,460
in the room we were all in?

377
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,660
Yes, the ones written by a child in crayon.

378
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,460
The one I was sitting on, had "Me" written on it,

379
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,560
and Ran's had "Mama".

380
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,660
But on the back of the one I was sitting on was...

381
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,260
"Mr. Kaneshiro".

382
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,960
The little girl wrote it, didn't she?

383
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,460
Then Mr. Kaneshiro would be her father then, wouldn't he?

384
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,660
I wonder why she didn't write Papa?

385
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,360
And those were the only chairs with names on them.

386
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,160
Another thing bothers me, there weren't any chairs

387
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,460
for Kachan and Chiyoni who she compared heights with.

388
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,560
I know.

389
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,660
It seems strange that they'd have their own rooms but no chairs.

390
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,960
Kachan and Chiyoni.

391
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,960
What's that mean?

392
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,320
"Castle"

394
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,860
The next episode will conclude this case.

395
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,900
-You are the killer. -You are the killer.
