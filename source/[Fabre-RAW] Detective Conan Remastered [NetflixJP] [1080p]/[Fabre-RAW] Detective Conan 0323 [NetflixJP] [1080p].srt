1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Is Tokyo a weak point for the detective of the West?

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,140
His life is at stake and are forced to send out an SOS!

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,960
Is it here, Kazuha?

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,660
No. It's not there, Heiji.

10
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,360
More to the left.

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,260
Left?

12
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,760
Is it around here?

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,860
It hurts!

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,360
Where do you stick it at, Heiji?

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,260
I told you it's to the left.

16
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,760
You fool! Keep your voice down.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,860
They will hear us.

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,360
Darn it.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
The safety pin went into the slit in the floor.

20
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,060
You're so clumsy!

21
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,060
You can't get rid of this cuff without it.

22
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,060
Don't you have anything else? Like a wire?

23
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,760
No, that's the only thing I got.

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,460
Darn it.

25
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,760
Well, maybe it's better if we try solve this cipher.

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,560
They said if we solve it, they'd release us.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
That's right!

28
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,060
If you want to go out and see the sun,

29
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,260
solve it quickly or...

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,060
Mr. Kusukawa?

31
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,860
You will be as cold as he is.

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Heiji.

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,560
Don't worry.

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,460
They don't know...

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,260
that we have him.

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,560
Who do you mean by him?

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,060
Yes.

38
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,460
I'm sure of it.

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,660
I'm sure he will find us.

40
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,360
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 1)"

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
"Mouri Detective Agency"

42
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,860
They're late.

43
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,160
Heiji and Kazuha.

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,860
Yes.

45
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,160
The date was at 1:00 pm, but it's 2:00 pm already.

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,860
I wonder if anything happened.

47
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,560
Then, why don't you call them?

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,760
They carry a cell phone, don't they?

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,260
I called them, but it seems to be switched off.

50
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,260
They probably forgot, and are sleeping at home.

51
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,660
I called Heiji's mom,

52
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,560
and she said they took the 8:00 am plane right on time.

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
8:00 am?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,360
They sure took such an early flight to arrive here in the afternoon.

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,860
I just remembered. They did say that they want to visit someone.

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,760
The guy worked for the Police Detective Toyama who is Kazuha's father.

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,460
Now, he's working for a private detective agency here in Tokyo.

58
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,760
His name is Mr. Kusukawa, and it seems that they're going to meet him.

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,560
Could he be Mr. Kusukawa at the Haido Detective Agency?

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,760
Huh? Do you know him?

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,960
Yes.

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,760
Horse racing, motorboat racing, bicycle racing...

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,660
He loves to gamble.

64
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,160
Say, why did Heiji and Kazuha go meet him?

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,760
He sent Kazuha's father a letter

66
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,260
saying he has an important matter to talk to him about,

67
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,660
but he hasn't called since.

68
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,560
So, Kazuha's father got worried

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
and asked them to go see how he's doing.

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,660
Maybe they got busy talking about their father,

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
and forgot about the time.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,260
I wonder.

73
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,960
Well, I'll try call him up.

74
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,360
"Haido Detective Agency"

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Yes, this is Haido Detective Agency.

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,160
Mr. Mouri, how are you?

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,560
Huh? Kusukawa?

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,660
We haven't been able to get in touch with him for a couple of days now.

79
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,060
He said he was after a big case,

80
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,460
so I suppose he is staking up somewhere.

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,060
A big case?

82
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,360
Do you in a need of one more player to play mahjong?

83
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,660
No. We would like to know

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,560
if two high school kids called on Mr. Kusukawa.

85
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,860
Yes. They were here at about 10 am.

86
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,760
A boy and a girl from Osaka, aren't they?

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
I told them Kusukawa is not in the office,

88
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,660
so after I gave them his address, they left.

89
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,460
May I have that address, please?

90
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,960
Haido street, 4...

91
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,460
Arihato Apartment.

92
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,760
Give me a break.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,060
The hosts shouldn't have to search for the guests.

94
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,760
What's the problem? You're not busy anyway.

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,860
It's not okay.

96
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,660
I hope it stops raining soon.

97
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,160
You're going on an excursion tomorrow, aren't you?

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,460
Yes.

99
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,360
Isn't that the Arihito Apartment?

100
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,860
Let me see. Mr. Kusukawa's room number

101
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,660
is number 202.

102
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,060
Room 202.

103
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,960
Room 202...

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,160
Huh?

105
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,060
"I'll be back by noon.

106
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,960
Deliver any packages to the landlord, please."

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,260
Hey, hey.

108
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,960
It's way past noon already.

109
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
He is always behind time.

110
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,060
Maybe he was here when both of them came by,

111
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,960
and they went out together for a soda or something.

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,360
With the intention to come back by noon.

113
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,460
I saw a family restaurant on this way.

114
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,860
But it looks like Heiji kept waiting for a long time.

115
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,360
Look there, to the right of the paper.

116
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,960
You can see a set mark.

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,260
Doesn't it look like a mark of the cap Heiji usually wears?

118
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,560
You're right.

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,060
This is the mark of Heiji's cap!

120
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,160
He must have put his cap on backwards

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,860
and leaned against the door while waiting for quite some time.

122
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,060
How do you know he kept waiting for a long time?

123
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,860
There's another mark of his cap left in a place just my height.

124
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,160
This means he got tired of waiting

125
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,860
and squatted down while leaning against the door, doesn't it?

126
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,560
It seems so.

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,560
A Scotch tape?

128
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,060
I know what this is!

129
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,360
It's a mark to detect if someone tried to sneak into your house.

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,460
Yes.

131
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,860
You see them in detective or spy movies.

132
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,260
But the tape is practically peeled off.

133
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,960
It shows that someone's snuck in here already, doesn't it?

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
It's possible that Mr. Kusukawa noticed it,

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,260
got frightened, and rushed to the police.

136
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,660
But it seems this tape was peeled off a long time ago.

137
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,960
A lot of dust is on the sticky part.

138
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,360
Hey, hey.

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Then, when did he put this paper on the door?

140
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,060
Mr. Kusukawa intends to come back soon,

141
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,160
but for some reason he couldn't.

142
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,860
And while he was away, somebody broke into this room.

143
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,960
What shall we do, Dad?

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,060
What do you mean that?

145
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,760
Wait a second, Conan!

146
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,660
It's not locked.

147
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,860
It's like as I said, somebody's snucked into this room already.

148
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,060
Hey...

149
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,460
The lock shows it was not forced open,

150
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,960
and the room doesn't seem to be ransacked.

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,860
Did he just forget to lock the door?

152
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,460
And that tape, too.

153
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,260
I guess he forgot he put it there and opened the door himself.

154
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,360
Huh? What's this?

155
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,960
What?

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,560
Look here.

157
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,760
He put something on the desk

158
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,060
and rubbed it over with a pencil which left the traces.

159
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,560
What did you say?

160
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,460
Can it be this memo note?

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,560
There, the size just fits.

162
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,260
I see.

163
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,560
He rubbed over the traces the pencil made on the paper underneath.

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,360
That Osaka boy must've been worried since Kusukawa was missing,

165
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,960
and the door was unlocked.

166
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,260
To figure out where Kusukawa was, that boy took the note with him.

167
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,160
Well, the note that shows the letters are with him now.

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,160
So, we don't know what's written on it.

169
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,360
But I can see the letters if I rub it with a pencil.

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Of course!

171
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
The pencil point pressed hard enough on the paper

172
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,960
that it left traces on the paper two sheets below.

173
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,160
Let's see. Itou of Kenbashi street?

174
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,060
There's a phone number on it, too.

175
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,460
But I can't make it out.

176
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,960
Could Hattori and Kazuha have gone there?

177
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,360
Then, let's go there and have a look.

178
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,260
We can ask for directions at a police box to help us find the house.

179
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,760
A couple of high school kids that speak in Kansai accent?

180
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,060
They aren't here.

181
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,860
By the way, are you a police detective or something?

182
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,860
Oh, no. We are just looking for them.

183
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,060
Thank you very much.

184
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,260
Well, I didn't see any high school kids with a Kansai accent around here.

185
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,760
Aren't you Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the sleeping detective?

186
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,160
A high school boy from Osaka?

187
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,760
Isn't the high school baseball tournament in Osaka is over?

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,860
I don't know them or anybody else!

189
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,160
Why do you keep picking on me?

190
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,760
A boy and a girl with a Kansai accent?

191
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,260
They haven't been here.

192
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,960
I thought so.

193
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,260
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

194
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,160
That pin on your lapel.

195
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,260
It's an attorney's lapel pin.

196
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,960
Excuse me, but are you Miss Misari Itou who is an attorney?

197
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,460
Seriously?

198
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,260
"Misari Itou" -Yes, I am.

199
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,560
My mother told me about you.

200
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,860
You're the admirable attorney

201
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,060
who accepts all requests for a modest fee.

202
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,760
Then, is your mother also an attorney?

203
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,660
-Yes, ma'am. -You are a blabbermouth, Ran.

204
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:04,460
Well, do you happen to know a suspicious Itou residence around here?

205
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,260
Suspicious?

206
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,560
Oh, that reminds me.

207
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,960
There's a building that bears a nameplate Itou.

208
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,760
It's right behind the elementary school on the 5th street.

209
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,560
Children have been saying that there's two men who looked like hobos

210
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,960
often come and go there at night.

211
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,260
That's it!

212
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,560
That's where they went, and so are we!

213
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
What? Are we?

214
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,460
Sure we are.

215
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Let's go.

216
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,560
Thank you very much, ma'am.

217
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,760
You're welcome.

218
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,860
Okay, okay.

219
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,660
Let's go in, shall we?

220
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,460
You must be hungry.

221
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,360
But could you wait for a little while, dear?

222
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,260
Your mom is busy right now.

223
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,960
After I finish my work,

224
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,260
I'll feed you. Okay, dear?

225
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,160
Good kitty.

226
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
Mommy has to go up to them

227
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,560
and let them know where they stand.

228
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,260
I've got to see to it that they feel it to the bones.

229
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Oh, my. What a sight to see.

230
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,840
What happened to your handsome face? You're losing it.

231
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,640
This brat tried to shout,

232
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,740
and I caught him in time.

233
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,340
Heiji, are you alright?

234
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,740
Don't give in.

235
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,040
You surprise me, boy.

236
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,140
You're an acquaintance of the Kogoro Mouri.

237
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,440
You really know a lot of people,

238
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,840
high school kid detective, Heiji Hattori, don't you?

239
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,240
You've been invited here because of that great ability of yours.

240
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,040
So, do solve the cipher for us, will you?

241
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,040
That cipher that this stinking rat of a detective thought up.

242
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,540
What a laugh. But I'm sure you agree with me, too.

243
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,540
This guy had the nerve to preach me.

244
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,040
He asked me to stop instructing people how to evade taxes illegally.

245
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,240
He had the tape to prove my doings,

246
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,040
but didn't want to publicize it.

247
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,840
The tape is in the safe deposit box in Tohto Bank

248
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,540
with a seven digit number as an ID.

249
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,940
Unfortunately, that's all he could tell us before he stopped breathing.

250
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,740
And that's when we got a call from this boy.

251
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,840
Excuse me.

252
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,440
I couldn't hear you very well because I have a ringing in my ear.

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,140
Give it a second thought, and tell me one more time.

254
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,040
Who the stinking rat really is?

255
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,640
Heiji!

256
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,040
Don't get funny, boy.

257
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,340
So, you haven't learned your lesson well enough.

258
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,540
Scrape his ears off, so he can hear better.

259
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
Heiji!

260
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,440
Stop it, please!

261
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Darn it.

262
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,840
Why are there so many visitors today?

263
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,240
It's that little kid.

264
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,740
Hello, little one. What's the matter?

265
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,240
You forgot something?

266
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,340
No, ma'am.

267
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,340
I came back here because something bothers me.

268
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,540
Kudo!

269
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,340
What bothers you, dear little one?

270
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,140
The footprints of shoes.

271
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,840
There are so many wet shoe marks,

272
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,340
so I was wondering where all those people are in the house.

273
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,140
There were callers just a while ago.

274
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,040
We talked in the hall and they left soon after.

275
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,240
So, right now I'm alone in this house.

276
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,540
-Then, those prints are strange, aren't they? -Huh?

277
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,340
There are all marks for going in, but none for going out.

278
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,640
Why?

279
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,440
That's right. They are my footprints.

280
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,040
They stuck a gun at me in the hall.

281
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,540
I was handcuffed, then brought straight into this attic

282
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,940
and was confined.

283
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,040
This is the footprint of my sneakers for jogging.

284
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,240
They're yours?

285
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,340
Yes.

286
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,940
I washed the mud off, and I'm drying the shoes in the bathroom.

287
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,840
That's why you don't see them here.

288
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,140
Conan!

289
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,240
What are you doing there?

290
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,240
You disappeared so suddenly, so we were worried about you.

291
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
They're looking for you, dear.

292
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,640
You have to go find both of your friends, don't you?

293
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,140
Do you want to get killed right now?

294
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,840
What's that sound?

295
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,640
It came from upstairs.

296
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,740
Well...

297
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,240
You said you are alone in the house, didn't you?

298
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,940
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

299
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,840
It may be a burglar!

300
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,940
It's the cat I saw a while ago.

301
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,340
Oh, my. Naughty kitty.

302
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,040
You shouldn't drop things down the stairs.

303
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,440
She is very naughty.

304
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
She drops things and makes them go rolling down so often.

305
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,040
She must've made that sound.

306
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,740
I have to go out now.

307
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,240
But if you insist,

308
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,340
I can go with you and help you find the burglar.

309
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,240
Come, let's go upstairs.

310
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,240
Putting on a kind front and try to deceive him.

311
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,240
But Kudo won't fall for it, you fool.

312
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,740
Why don't you come on up, dear detective?

313
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,640
I think I'll go home!

314
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,340
Huh?

315
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,740
Oh, really?

316
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,640
You don't have to worry about me, feel free to come up.

317
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,740
No, it's not that.

318
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,440
So long, ma'am.

319
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,740
Don't so long me. Hey, hey!

320
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,940
So long, little one.

321
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,040
He's gone I suppose.

322
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,240
He sure scared me.

323
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,740
Sorry, guys.

324
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,440
You expected them to come back, but only a little kid did, right?

325
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,340
Oh, no. What do you think you're doing?

326
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,040
He's really going home!

327
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,240
He must have his reasons.

328
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,040
Look, he's thinking something over.

329
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,140
Take a good look at him, fool.

330
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,640
He's being held tightly in her arms.

331
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,740
Although he's a bit ashamed, but he's glad at the same time.

332
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,140
You can tell from his look. What a disgusting face.

333
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,240
In her arms? I'm talking about Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

334
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,440
The old man is probably listening to the horse races live on the radio.

335
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Now, leading by three to four lengths!

336
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,540
Good, keep on leading to the finish!

337
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,840
Looks like we have no choice,

338
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,040
but to break this glass and make them notice us.

339
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,040
What are you trying to do, you brats?

340
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,840
Gosh.

341
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
This is becoming tiresome.

342
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,440
Now, it's time for your homework.

343
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,140
You'd better make the most of your brain.

344
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,240
You're the famous high school detective in Osaka.

345
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,040
It should be easier for you than your math, right?

346
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,940
This is a simple cipher to you.

347
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,240
Get to your work.

348
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,140
And be sure to solve it by sundown,

349
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,540
if you don't want end up like him.

350
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,740
You want to stay on this side of the world, don't you?

351
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,740
What's the hurry?

352
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,540
Why don't we take time, relax and solve it?

353
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,240
Or is there anything to worry about tomorrow?

354
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,840
Yes, there sure is.

355
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,840
He told us that the same cipher will be delivered

356
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,240
to his detective agency tomorrow by the delivery service.

357
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
He attached a letter that has a copy of the cipher

358
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,240
which is for the seven digit ID number to the Tohto Bank safe deposit box.

359
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,240
He was such an idiot.

360
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,940
He assumed he was safe because of that arrangement,

361
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,440
and he was arrogant enough to tell me

362
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,140
that he wouldn't say anything about it

363
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,140
if I stop giving instructions on illegal tax evasion.

364
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm sure he was going to blackmail me

365
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,440
and use the money for gambling that he loved so much.

366
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
-Gambling? -Oh, yes.

367
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,640
I remember Dad told me.

368
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Mr. Kusukawa is known for loving to gambling.

369
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,540
Why didn't you tell me that before?

370
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,940
What? Did you find anything already?

371
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,540
Yes. Give me a little more time and leave me alone,

372
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,240
I think I can solve it.

373
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,740
Good for you.

374
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,340
Then, we'll have tea downstairs and will wait for you.

375
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,040
So, you better make full use of your brain to solve it.

376
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,440
And don't even think of running away from us.

377
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,140
Sure. Wait for us without expecting anything from us.

378
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,940
It's alright now, Mr. Kusukawa.

379
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,040
What?

380
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,340
You're still alive, aren't you?

381
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,440
The floor dust underneath your nose just flew off.

382
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Just as expected of the son of the Director of Police Headquarters.

383
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,140
I really was out of cold until just now.

384
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,540
You'd better keep pretending you're dead.

385
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,140
If they find you alive,

386
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,440
they'll stick a gun at us and try to make you talk.

387
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,740
The answer to this cipher is just like you.

388
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,240
Just like him?

389
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,840
You mean you found the answer to the cipher, Heiji?

390
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Yes, I did. The combination is easy to remember for a gambling fan.

391
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
By the way, Mr. Kusukawa,

392
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,640
is this the only copy of the cipher?

393
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,040
It is.

394
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,140
They didn't make any copy of it.

395
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,240
Good for us.

396
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,940
Just great for the gamble we're about to take.

397
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,120
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,700
"Dice"

399
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,820
Heiji, you finished Part 1 with ease.

400
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,000
Can you do it alone?

401
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,160
He's not with us now, so I say, sure I can.

402
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,440
And I say, don't expect me to help you.
