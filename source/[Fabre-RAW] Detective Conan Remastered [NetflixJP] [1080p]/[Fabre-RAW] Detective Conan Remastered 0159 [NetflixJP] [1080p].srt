00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,810
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,610
Once he gets started, you can't stop him.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,610
Today, we visited a five-story pagoda deep in the mountains.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,710
Its legendary power leads to an impossible crime!

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,410
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,310
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,710
His name is Detective Conan!

"Genkai Temple"

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,950
Beautiful! What a great change of pace!

12
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,650
And we owe it all to you

13
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,350
for winning this prize in the contest.

14
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,450
But Conan, you're the one who solved the puzzle for me.

15
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,250
I couldn't believe how easy it was.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,150
Dad!

17
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,250
Let's go!

18
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,450
I hate it here!

19
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,550
This place is so depressing!

20
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,550
These free trips really are lousy!

21
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,750
What do you mean by that?

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,450
When you first heard about it,

23
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,850
you were so excited about taking a trip for free.

24
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,850
You two go on without me!

25
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,350
I'll just go back to the hotel and soak in the bath!

26
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,350
Excuse me.

27
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,150
"Juukichi Okabe (55)" -Smoking is not allowed on temple grounds.

28
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,650
I didn't know.

29
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,950
We're terribly sorry

30
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,050
It's nothing. But it's true.

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,250
This place may be boring to the tourists.

32
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,150
That's not true!

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,150
You don't see sights like this while living in the city.

34
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,550
It cleanses the soul.

35
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,850
How nice of you.

36
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,950
For one so young you're very admirable,

37
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,450
If you like, I'll give you a tour of the temple.

38
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,050
Really? Could you?

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,850
Count me out!

40
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,850
You're being very rude, dad.

41
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,450
-Come on, let's go. -Darn it...

42
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,250
This temple was built 400 years ago

43
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,650
400 years ago...

44
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,250
It's very old.

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,450
Because of its age,

46
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,450
there are many historical sites here.

47
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,850
For example, there is an old well near the pagoda

48
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,850
which had been used until the middle of the Edo period.

49
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,050
Why did they stop using it?

50
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,950
It suddenly went dry.

51
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,350
Legend says that a young woman, who was heartbroken,

52
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,250
cried for three days and nights straight in front of the well.

53
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,350
As her tears ran dry, the water from the well

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,250
filled her eyes and it was used up.

55
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,150
Ridiculous.

56
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,950
There's a frightening legend behind this pagoda.

57
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,350
What kind of legend?

58
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,450
In the beginning of the Edo period,

59
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,950
there was a young monk who the head monk picked

60
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,550
to become the successor of this temple

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,250
but he fell in love with a girl from the village,

62
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,650
broke his vows, left the temple

63
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,450
and ran away to get married.

64
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,550
But...

65
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,350
Perhaps it was a curse,

66
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,250
the monk was taken away by the goshawk.

67
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,250
The monk was later found dead.

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,550
Hanging from the pagoda.

69
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,750
How awful.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,550
There's more. In the middle of the Edo period,

71
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,450
a misguided monk here

72
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,650
sold the temples furnishings

73
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,550
used the money for liquor.

74
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,750
But one day he disappeared.

75
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,150
A few days later,

76
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,450
he was found dead hanging from the pagoda.

77
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,750
Since then, it has been said that

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,350
whoever breaks the vows of the temple will be cursed.

79
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,450
Hey, stop making those spooky faces.

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,750
Ghost!

81
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,650
Mr. Tan Kai!

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,850
Don't be afraid.

83
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,750
He's the head monk of this temple.

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,150
Head monk?

85
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,350
"Tan Kai (60)" -So, you're pretending to be a family this time.

86
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,450
What are you looking around for now?

87
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,650
No, wait.

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,350
They're only tourists.

89
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,550
They look suspicious.

90
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,250
I don't trust them!

91
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,250
I don't want you to bring strangers around without my permission!

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,350
But tourism is the temples...

93
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,550
Nonsense!

94
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,050
Don't forget there are those

95
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,550
who will desecrate this temple for that very reason!

96
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,350
That's...

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,950
But soon, punishment will befall the unbeliever...

98
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,350
Punishment by the curse.

99
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,750
Excuse me. Is something wrong?

100
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,850
The truth is a tour company

101
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,850
took control of this property

102
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,150
and they decided to build an amusement park here.

103
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,050
Then, this area is going to change?

104
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,750
Yes, the head monk is opposing it saying he was tricked

105
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,650
and he's become bitter even toward tourists as you saw.

106
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,950
He has some nerve!

107
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,050
Scaring people Iike that.

108
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,550
Come on. Let's get out of here!

109
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,350
Dad, wait!

110
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,950
I am sorry. My fathers quite short tempered.

111
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,750
Don't apologize, the fault was all mine.

112
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,350
By the way, is your father by chance Kogoro Mouri?

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,650
Yes. Well... he's a private detective.

114
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,650
I knew it! He's that famous detective!

115
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,150
What an exciting story! I have to tell my grandchild.

116
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,650
What an honour.

117
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,750
Thank you for inviting us to dinner!

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,150
The honour is ours.

119
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,450
"Yousuke Kajimura (43)" -Our hotel just opened.

120
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,950
For a famous person as yourself to stay here

121
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,350
is an excellent advertisement.

122
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,950
I'm most willing to be of service if someone such as I am needed!

123
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,750
You certainly have the most beautiful hotel here!

124
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,150
"Hideaki Oda (56)" -Do you like it?

125
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,950
The amusement park I proposed will be completed next year,

126
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,950
then this place will be even more enjoyable!

127
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,850
Really, it must be costing you a lot of money.

128
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,950
Just about 80 billion!

129
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,950
But once it is completed,

130
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,950
I am expecting it will bring in several hundred billion annually.

131
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,850
That's incredible.

132
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,350
Forgive me.

133
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,850
I am the General Manager of this hotel.

134
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,350
Kajimura. You're being impertinent!

135
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,450
I can't believe you didn't realize that

136
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,350
the infamous Kogoro Mouri was staying here

137
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,650
until Okabe told you!

138
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,550
It shows that you were very careless.

139
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,350
I hope you learn from this!

140
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,350
Yes, I am terribly sorry.

141
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,350
By the way, aren't you going to Tokyo tonight on a business trip?

142
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,150
Do you think you should be wasting your time here?

143
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,750
Well, Mr. Mouri.

144
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,250
I hope you enjoy your stay.

145
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,950
Useless fool!

146
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,850
Forgive me, I sometimes forget myself.

147
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,650
You are very strict.

148
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,550
I get like that when it comes to business.

149
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,350
Hold on. Isn't that a diamond on your tie pin?

150
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,650
This... It's nothing much.

151
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,050
It's only about five carats.

152
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,550
Five carats, you say?

153
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,150
That's huge!

154
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,050
Stop that, dad! You're embarrassing me.

155
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,450
There, young lady...

156
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,750
Your father is just reacting naturally.

157
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,450
You call that natural?

158
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,850
Sir, your cigar!

159
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,650
Okay.

160
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,350
Hey! Where's the receipt?

161
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,950
Sorry.

162
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,250
The nerve! I can write this off as company expense!

163
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,250
Do you always carry around so much?

164
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,950
That's just petty change.

165
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,650
I hate to use credit cards.

166
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,150
"Shun Kai (26)" -Look at yourself. Enjoying a leisurely meal!

167
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,950
You are a disgrace!

168
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,350
Why if it isn't the heir to Genkai Temple?

169
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,850
Have you completed your training at the head temple?

170
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,250
How dare you use political means to deceive my father.

171
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
You won't get away with this!

172
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,150
I've come back to the temple to make sure of that!

173
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,250
Calm down, watch what you were saying!

174
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,750
Your father and I discussed the matter carefully!

175
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,050
Enough! You told my father that he should sign over the deed

176
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,450
to the people to Oda Tours temporarily in order to raise funds

177
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,850
for the preservation of the temple's environment.

178
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,650
He trusted your advice!

179
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,050
But he's prepared to take you to court now!

180
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,350
Is that all you have to say?

181
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,850
What?

182
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,850
I am entertaining my guests now.

183
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,350
If there is anything else,

184
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,250
come to my office tomorrow.

185
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,450
You're sadly mistaken

186
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,850
if you think you heard the last from me!

187
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,950
Let me go!

188
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,350
Forgive all the intrusions.

189
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,950
Too many problems happened

190
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,850
Are you having trouble with the people at the temple?

191
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,650
It's nothing.

192
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,850
They are suspicious of the development plans

193
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,650
and some of them are protesting telling us that

194
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,950
we'll destroy the atmosphere of that rundown temple

195
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,450
They are going to gain from the tourism business too.

196
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,550
What a stupid bunch of fools.

197
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,650
Ran, didn't we hear that a curse will fall on anyone

198
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,050
who harms that temple?

199
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,850
Conan, no! Don't talk about that now!

200
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,150
I know about that legend!

201
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,150
A lot of people have warned me about it!

202
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,050
But that too can be used to draw the tourists.

203
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,650
It's a matter of how one looks at things!

204
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,950
This guy is a shark.

205
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,450
Hello. This is Mouri Detective Agency.

206
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,150
Okabe here. I showed you around the temple yesterday!

207
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,450
This is bad! The curse come true!

208
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,250
What?

209
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,650
The curse?

210
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,050
Please come to the temple right now!

211
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,850
Hey, wait a minute!

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,950
Mr. Mouri! Hurry up!

213
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,050
Hold it! I want an explanation!

214
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,150
The frightening curse has come true!

215
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,550
What? That curse.

216
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,550
"Morning Prayer" -He is just reciting the morning prayers!

217
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,050
Not there!

218
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,150
It's over there!

219
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
Mr. Oda!

220
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,150
It's the curse...

221
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
The crime lab is done with their investigation.

222
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,940
So the body will be lowered.

223
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,240
"Officer Yokomizo" -How does it look?

224
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,240
The victim was found with the rope tied to the railing.

225
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
The other end was swung over the edge of the roof

226
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
and around the neck.

227
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,640
He has been tentatively identified as Hideaki Oda,

228
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,840
president of a tour company.

229
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,940
A private detective who knows him

230
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,440
is going up to make a positive ID

231
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,340
Private detective? What's his name?

232
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,440
It's me, Officer Yokomizo.

233
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,540
Why if it isn't Mr. Mouri?

234
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,340
It's been a long time!

235
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,940
Why are you here?

236
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,340
It just turned out this way.

237
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,440
To come straight to the point.

238
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,840
What do you think about this case?

239
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,240
From the evidence, it looks like suicide.

240
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,140
Well... The circumstances are strange

241
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,540
but it's definitely not murder!

242
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,640
What makes you say that?

243
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,940
First, Mr. Oda weighs about 100kg!

244
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,240
A normal person wouldn't be able to carry him

245
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,940
all the way up there!

246
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,040
And even if the killer managed to carry him up,

247
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,240
the width of the stairwell is very narrow,

248
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
just enough for one adult to pass!

249
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
It's possible to drag him up

250
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,840
but his clothes would get torn and the body would get bruised!

251
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,440
And I did not notice any of those things just now!

252
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I see! You've deducted so much already!

253
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
But why did he pick such a place?

254
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,840
A little more...

255
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
That's it! Stop!

256
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,240
This is a new mark. I wonder how it got here?

257
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,440
The rope is new but it's frayed in some places.

258
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,740
What is it?

259
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,540
How are we going to get him down?

260
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,440
His feet don't reach the railing!

261
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,340
That's not possible, isn't it?

262
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,840
If his feet don't reach the railing...

263
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,440
Hey, you kid!

264
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
What are you doing here?

265
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,640
Go down!

266
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,440
I was looking for the toilet and got lost.

267
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,040
It's not here, is it?

268
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,440
That's strange. I wonder where it is?

269
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,340
Who was that kid?

270
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,440
Beats me.

271
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,140
According to the crime lab,

272
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,340
there wasn't much dust inside the pagoda

273
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,640
so they couldn't find the victim's footprints!

274
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,240
And we had the torn doctor do an autopsy,

275
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,940
he didn't find any external injuries

276
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,340
and the cause of death was determined to be

277
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,240
suffocation due to pressure on the neck region!

278
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,640
Meaning the direct cause of death was by hanging.

279
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,240
The estimated time of death is

280
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,740
somewhere between 3 and 4 am.

281
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,340
Mr. Oda was using a suite in his hotel

282
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,940
as his office and home

283
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,940
but the front clerk said he saw Mr. Oda leave the hotel

284
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,340
at about 2:30 am.

285
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,940
Judging by the time,

286
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,040
I think it's safe to assume he came straight here?

287
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,640
-Is there any will? -We haven't found one yet!

288
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,040
Mr. Oda!

289
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,840
Mr. Oda! Why did you kill yourself?

290
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,940
You should have waited, just a little longer...

291
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,240
Excuse me, who are you?

292
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,540
I am employed as the general manager of Hotel Oda.

293
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,640
My name is Kajimura.

294
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,040
It seems that you weren't here last night.

295
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,640
Yes. I have a sudden business trip.

296
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,240
Do you know of any reason why he would commit suicide?

297
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,940
The truth is, the purpose of my business trip

298
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,040
was to raise funds...

299
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,140
If I failed,

300
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,640
the checks the firm wrote this month

301
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,040
would bounce at the end of the month.

302
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,440
I wasn't the only one.

303
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,540
Mr. Oda was also very worried about that.

304
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,240
But he was carrying so much money on him last night.

305
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,140
Mr. Oda had a lot of pride,

306
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,240
he never showed his weaknesses to anyone.

307
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,340
And of course, he always put on a bold front

308
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,340
but last night, when he was threatened

309
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,240
to be taken to court by the temple,

310
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,140
he seemed very concerned.

311
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,440
Look at this!

312
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,540
It seems like he doesn't have his wallet!

313
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,740
Wallet?

314
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,140
There is no wallet in his possession.

315
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,840
Isn't that strange?

316
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,340
He didn't change his clothes

317
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,340
but the wallet he had with him last night is gone!

318
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,840
Dummy! Who carries a lot of money on them

319
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,340
when they're committing suicide!

320
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,840
I always told you to not wander around the crime scene.

321
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,640
But his tie pin is gone too!

322
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,740
Shut up!

323
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Are you all right?

324
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,740
You mustn't interfere with the police work.

325
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,940
Mr Mouri, what did he mean by tie pin?

326
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,840
Mr. Oda had it on last night.

327
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,140
The huge five carat diamond tie pin

328
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,840
is indeed missing!

329
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,240
Which means...

330
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
he could have been robbed!

331
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,640
Even if he was robbed,

332
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,540
he was on his way to commit suicide,

333
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,140
he probably gave up his valuables very easily!

334
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,040
So it doesn't refute the suicide theory at all!

335
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,240
If he was strangled,

336
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,340
he would struggle trying to get free

337
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,240
and scratch his own throat with his fingernails!

338
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,940
But there are no traces of that!

339
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,840
And even if this was a murder,

340
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,540
how would the killer hang the victim

341
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,640
from the top of the pagoda?

342
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,740
Aside from suicide, it is physically impossible!

343
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,040
If there was a killer,

344
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,240
it would be that curse.

345
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,240
It was a just reward.

346
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,040
Heaven punished the unbeliever!

347
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,640
I am Officer Yokomizo of the Shizuoka Prefectural Police.

348
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I'm sorry but may I ask who you are?

349
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,340
Can't you tell by looking?

350
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,340
I'm Tan Kai, the head monk of this temple!

351
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm his son, Shun kai.

352
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm Okabe, the labourer here.

353
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:13,040
Can all of you tell me where you were between 3 to 4 am?

354
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,740
What is the meaning of this?

355
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
Wasn't this a suicide?

356
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,040
No, we haven't reached a decision.

357
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,840
And also because some of Mr. Oda's valuables are missing.

358
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,340
What did you say?

359
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,440
Are you accusing us, men serving Buddha, of thievery?

360
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,940
Oh, no.

361
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,640
We just need your alibis for our records.

362
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,240
You'd probably be happy

363
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,140
if I said I was meeting with that no good liar

364
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,840
but I was in the main hall chanting at that time!

365
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Chanting?

366
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,340
You were chanting at that time of night?

367
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,740
I had a premonition that

368
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,840
the curse would come true!

369
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,240
A curse... you say?

370
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
And what about you, Shun kai?

371
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,340
I was asleep! Although I got up at 5 am!

372
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,840
Then Mr. Okabe came with the news that

373
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,740
Mr. Oda was dead!

374
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,040
I was so shocked

375
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,940
so I called Mr. Mouri right away!

376
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,340
I see...

377
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,540
Why did you call Mr. Mouri first and not the police?

378
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,640
This man is Oda's spy!

379
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,540
He was the one who introduced me to Oda!

380
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,640
Mr. Tan Kai! Mr. Oda told me that

381
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
he wanted to help the temple

382
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,740
by increasing the number of tourists!

383
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,840
He... He lied to me too!

384
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,940
You too?

385
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,740
It seems the head monk here was deceived

386
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
and got the deed to the temple taken.

387
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,440
So there are three people who hated Mr. Oda!

388
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,340
So what if we did hate him?

389
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,940
That private detective said

390
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,740
there's no way that suicide theory can be disproved.

391
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,040
And in a suicide, there is no killer, is there?

392
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,840
Well... We haven't concluded it as a suicide yet.

393
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,240
Then make a decision and get off of this property!

394
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,740
I can no longer tolerate having these sacred grounds trampled on

395
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,140
by those who are impure!

396
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,840
But Mr. Oda's wallet and tie pin are indeed missing

397
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,640
but from how things look,

398
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,540
suicide seems to be the only answer!

399
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,340
But something isn't right!

400
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,140
His elbow is dirty.

401
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,540
It's grass.

402
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,940
Did he fall and hit his elbow?

403
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,840
There's dirt on both heels!

404
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,640
Why is there dirt on his heels?

405
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,940
Wait a minute!

406
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,740
If you look closely, you can see this rope is charred.

407
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,340
Maybe...

408
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
There it is!

409
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
The tie pin!

410
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,640
There's no mistake!

411
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,340
This is where it really happened!

412
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,040
If my theory is correct...

413
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,740
Mr. Oda didn't commit suicide!

414
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,940
He was murdered!

415
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
And the killer most probably is

416
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,940
the person who said what he did...

417
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,140
It's him!
