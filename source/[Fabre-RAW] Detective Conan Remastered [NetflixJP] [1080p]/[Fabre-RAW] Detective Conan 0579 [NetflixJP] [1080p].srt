1
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,822
What? You saw Shuichi Akai?

2
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:29,622
Remember that robbery

3
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,822
at Tohto Bank at Beikacho the other day?

4
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:34,013
They reported on the news that the trial

5
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,522
for that incident started yesterday,

6
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:40,322
it seems that he was seen turning around towards the camera.

7
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:42,422
A man who resembled him

8
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:44,822
seemed to be among the people who were released.

9
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,422
Well, it's most probably some guy that just looks like him, though.

10
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:55,322
Because after all, you and me,

11
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,422
we confirmed with our own eyes.

12
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:02,041
That Akai who came walking right into our trap at Raiha pass,

13
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:06,422
was shot in the head by Kir's gun.

14
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:37,322
-Go get Kir. -What?

15
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:41,522
Sherry who got away appeared at Haido City Hotel.

16
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:48,087
Akai who tried to attack us, lured us to go

17
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:51,322
to the Mouri Detective Agency in Beikacho.

18
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:57,222
The hospital that the FBI confined Kir in

19
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:58,822
was the Haido Central Hospital.

20
00:01:58,822 --> 00:01:59,822
"Haido Central Hospital"

21
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,022
And, the man who resembled Akai

22
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:08,122
appeared at the bank in Beikacho.

23
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:11,822
Beikacho and Haidocho are so near.

24
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:14,113
Do you think this is a coincidence?

25
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,522
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,622
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,125
There is a bomb scare at a department store.

28
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:28,922
What are the men in black after?

29
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,622
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:32,522
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,422
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:18,237
The man that we ran into on our way home from school

33
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:20,012
was called Mr. Kyozo Daita.

34
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:25,112
After realizing that he was planning on committing suicide,

35
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,012
we tried to somehow stop him from doing so and succeeded.

36
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:29,412
But, at that time I found out

37
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:33,112
from Genta and the others about an unexpected fact.

38
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:35,812
When we encountered the bank robbery,

39
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:38,257
they say that the man, who was also present

40
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:42,261
at the previous bus jack we got messed up in, was there.

41
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:44,912
That person can't possibly be...

42
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:49,112
In the meantime, a strange job offer

43
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,612
came to the Mouri Detective Agency.

44
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,012
The client asked us to solve a mystery

45
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:56,275
about red T-shirts that were being sent every week,

46
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,712
and asked us to talk to him.

47
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,281
The following day, in order to meet the client,

48
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,912
we went to the Beika Department Store.

49
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:10,289
FBI agent, Jodie was also there.

50
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,012
The person she is searching for is most probably,

51
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,293
that man.

52
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:23,812
"The 13 Black Suggestions"

53
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,012
"Beika Department Store"

54
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,212
Really, I tell you.

55
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:38,317
It's after 1 pm already.

56
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,812
The client hasn't shown up yet.

57
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:43,312
Forget it.

58
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,812
I'm quitting!

59
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:50,012
We're going home.

60
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,412
I wonder what this paper bag is?

61
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,512
Maybe somebody forgot it?

62
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:01,512
I don't think you should touch that.

63
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:08,112
Because I think there's a bomb inside it.

64
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:09,612
Bomb?

65
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:11,112
You said bomb?

66
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,612
How do you know?

67
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:16,912
Well...

68
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:20,812
Because I am also...

69
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,312
Look at me.

70
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,212
That's why.

71
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,012
A bomb?

72
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,375
I'm sorry, James.

73
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,912
I haven't finished lunch yet.

74
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:43,312
Hey, just how long do you intend to spend on lunch, Jodie?

75
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,312
Well, a lot of things have been happening

76
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,912
and I'm still at the cafe on the basement floor.

77
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:52,012
A lot of things? Any problem?

78
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,412
No, it's nothing like that.

79
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,812
Okay, after Camel comes out of the men's room,

80
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:00,012
and I finish drinking my ice tea,

81
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,401
we'll head on to join you there.

82
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,812
I wonder, what's gotten into her?

83
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:09,712
Jodie recently seems to have changed.

84
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,411
Ever since the robbery, I think.

85
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,012
She told me not to tell James

86
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:18,212
but I wonder what her concern about the black cap is?

87
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:30,429
Hold... Hold it...

88
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,433
Hold it there!

89
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,812
That was... It can't be...

90
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,212
It can't be!

91
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,212
Strange...

92
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:56,455
If a man with a burn who can't talk comes to shop,

93
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,612
I'm sure that one of the sales clerks should remember him.

94
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,112
Does that mean that there was no such person in the first place?

95
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:05,412
Then who was that guy that I saw?

96
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:12,471
Shu?

97
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,612
Sorry.

98
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,112
Shu.

99
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,812
Shu, is it you? It's you, isn't it, Shu?

100
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,612
Tell me that it's you, Shu!

101
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,012
What's it about?

102
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:32,912
The edge of the coaster is bent.

103
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,493
Was it bent to begin with?

104
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:42,012
Get out of here! This area is dangerous.

105
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:45,812
Shu!

106
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,412
Shu!

107
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:04,523
Why do you have something like that on your body?

108
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,525
I have no idea!

109
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,912
I was attacked from behind in the men's room and passed out.

110
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:12,912
When I came, a masked man had wrapped this around me.

111
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,612
That man told me

112
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:18,537
to put paper bags in front of the escalator

113
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,212
as well as in front of the stairs too, so I did.

114
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:26,312
He threatened to set the bomb off if I didn't listen to him.

115
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:27,812
At any rate, get the police!

116
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:30,549
-Call the police, won't you... -No, you can't!

117
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,551
Because he told me that the moment the police

118
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,712
approached this department store,

119
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:37,212
he would push the bomb switch to set it off!

120
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:38,557
And of course,

121
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,912
he told me that even if one person flees from this floor,

122
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,561
that's it.

123
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,112
No way... Can't be!

124
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:48,112
What did the man want?

125
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:50,569
He wanted to find

126
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:55,712
the sender who puts of the 13 red T-shirts in this bag.

127
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:58,577
He needs to be found at any cost.

128
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,112
-Red T-shirts? -What?

129
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:05,312
Yes. He said that...

130
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:08,587
the sender is definitely on this floor!

131
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,512
He's definitely on this floor?

132
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:19,012
"Beika Department Store"

133
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,412
Hey... Are you serious?

134
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,212
He said that if he can't find the sender of the T-shirts,

135
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:28,012
he's going to blow up the bomb?

136
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:34,912
Yes. The masked man who wrapped the bomb around my body said so.

137
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:39,712
Moreover, he tells you that the sender is on this floor too?

138
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,512
Yes.

139
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,612
He said that if the person turns up,

140
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:50,212
he won't push the switch of the bomb.

141
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:52,412
Hey! You heard what he just said, didn't you?

142
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,012
I don't know what your problem is,

143
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:57,112
but come out you, sender of the load of red T-shirts!

144
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:59,512
If you're here, please come on out!

145
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:09,112
I guess nobody's coming out.

146
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,312
Yes.

147
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:13,112
He was saying to turn off the escalators

148
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:17,312
and to make sure that the elevator doesn't stop on this floor too.

149
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,912
I see.

150
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,659
He plans to keep all the people confined here

151
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,412
until he finds the sender of the T-shirts.

152
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,312
It can't be.

153
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,312
No way, no darn way!

154
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:30,669
Hey, hold it!

155
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,012
Hold your horses! Hey!

156
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,212
Calm down, hey!

157
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,312
Everyone, calm down!

158
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:38,677
Hey!

159
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,540
Excuse me. Please stay on this floor.

160
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,840
Calm down!

161
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,140
You heard what he said, didn't you?

162
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,340
The culprit is saying

163
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,731
that he wants to find the one who send him the red T-shirts

164
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,735
and that he's sure that the sender is here on this floor.

165
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,739
He also saying that if anyone flees from this floor,

166
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,540
he's going to switch the bomb on!

167
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,740
Of course calling the police is the out of the question!

168
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,540
Even if one person acts on his own, there's going to be victims.

169
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,340
I mean, that's what he said, right?

170
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,540
Yes.

171
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,940
Excuse me,

172
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,140
but could you call the person in charge

173
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
and have the escalators stopped

174
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,767
as well as not make the elevators stop on this floor.

175
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,540
-Yes, sir. -Of course not to use stairs too.

176
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Please make sure too that no one contacts the police!

177
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,940
Because it is very likely that the culprit is here

178
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,783
and watching everything that we're doing.

179
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,540
All right.

180
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,440
So, what are we going to do now?

181
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,640
Why don't we take a look?

182
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,240
At the mysterious red T-shirts

183
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,799
that are being sent to him every week!

184
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,801
What? Did I mention it?

185
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,640
That they were being sent every week?

186
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,809
A client who seems to know the bomb man asked us to do some checking.

187
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,240
We were told by the person who red T-shirts sent to him every week,

188
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,640
would come after noon to the sports goods floor

189
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,819
of the Beika Department Store

190
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,340
and would like me,

191
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,840
Kogoro Mouri's help on the matter!

192
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,240
Kogoro Mouri...

193
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,340
You mean that famous detective?

194
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,240
Yes. That's why,

195
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,340
I will find the sender of the red T-shirts and bomb man right away!

196
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,940
Well, keep your distance and watch.

197
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,440
Yes...

198
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,847
What?

199
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,340
A man with a burn scar on his right cheek

200
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,540
left this store a while ago?

201
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,640
Is that true?

202
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,340
Yes. Right after you left to go outside

203
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,640
to answer the call that you received.

204
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,865
That man, wasn't he wearing a cap like this?

205
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,640
Yes, he was.

206
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:54,240
Is he Mr. Akai?

207
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,640
I passed him in the men's room a while ago.

208
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,340
With a man who looks exactly like Mr. Akai with a burn scar.

209
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,540
No way! Is he here?

210
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,440
Yes. I lost track of him, though.

211
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,340
But, what brings him here?

212
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,240
What? Then don't tell me that the person you said

213
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
you saw during the bank robbery was...

214
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,640
Yes, exactly!

215
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,901
I was looking for him because he disappeared in the hustle and bustle

216
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,140
after the case.

217
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,540
Then I realized that the mark on the back of the cap

218
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,540
was an original design by the Beika Department Store.

219
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,040
So, I came down looking for a clue or something!

220
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,340
I wasn't too sure myself,

222
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,540
so I couldn't tell any of the agents yet.

223
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,240
Besides, it seems as though he lost his memory and can't talk,

224
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,440
so I couldn't confirm anything either.

225
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,240
You see...

226
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,933
Is it possible that this is a trap that they set?

227
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,340
What?

228
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,937
You said so yourself too!

229
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,940
That Shuichi Akai died!

230
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,640
You also confirmed the fingerprints of the corpse, didn't you?

231
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,340
There's no way that he's alive!

232
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,945
But...

233
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,140
The fingerprints of Conan and you were found,

234
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,540
along with fingerprints of the man

235
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,640
who burned to death a while ago.

236
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,540
If it's Shu, I'm sure he'll do something about the situation!

237
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,040
Besides, just what kind of trap do you propose this to be?

238
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,140
Well... maybe they're up to something

239
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,969
and trying to throw us off by confusing us.

240
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,971
The riot police?

241
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,440
Why?

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,340
Come to think of it, something happened on the floor above.

243
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,340
People were shouting that the elevator wouldn't stop on it.

244
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,740
If so, I'm sure that the man with the burn is Shu!

245
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,989
What?

246
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:56,440
Look! This is a message that the man with the burn secretly gave me.

247
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,140
What?

248
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,999
Then, Mr. Akai somehow found out beforehand

249
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,140
that something was going to happen at this department store and...

250
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,003
Yes.

251
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:09,007
There's no doubt that he already got his memory back.

252
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,009
But, what's going on?

253
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,740
What on earth is going on, Shu?

254
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,040
According to the torn piece of paper of the courier

255
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,940
that had been peeled off, where the T-shirts were inside,

256
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,029
the T-shirts that were sent 7 weeks, 6 weeks and 5 weeks ago

257
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,040
were all two each,

258
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,140
but for some reason the one sent 4 weeks ago,

259
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
was just one.

260
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,840
Then, 3 weeks, 2 weeks ago and last week,

261
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,640
two red T-shirts were sent again.

262
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,140
I wonder if there's any meaning to it?

263
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,051
I wonder...

264
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,340
They total 13 T-shirts in all, unlucky number...

265
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,840
Hey, don't come near me!

266
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,540
I mean you're carrying a bomb!

267
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,840
There something red on the shoulder

269
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,840
part of the coat you're wearing, sir.

270
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,140
Hey... if it's red,

271
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,240
is it has something to do with what's happening too?

272
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,340
Oh, I think it's somebody's lipstick.

273
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,440
Because the train I took here was quite crowded.

274
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,940
Is that so...

275
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,840
Anyway, you go and stay some distance away for a while.

276
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,540
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,093
There something more inside the package

278
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:39,097
-that the T-shirts were in. -What?

279
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,101
Isn't this the receipt of the T-shirts when they were bought?

280
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:46,140
The number of T-shirts that were bought match too.

281
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,740
A receipt?

282
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,107
Yes.

283
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,740
There's a receipt of the T-shirt for the package

284
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
with one T-shirt inside!

285
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,540
They seem to be inside the other packages too!

286
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,640
-What? -Look.

287
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,540
Certainly, the date shown on the receipt

288
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,740
and the date on the courier invoice match,

289
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,540
so we can tell that it was sent the same day it was bought.

290
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,340
Since the receipt is ripped,

291
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,840
it's impossible to tell where the item was bought.

292
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,740
But something is in view only on the receipt

293
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,040
for the T-shirts bought last week.

294
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,940
See, it wasn't ripped off clean enough,

295
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,740
so a mark of something is in view.

296
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,040
This is...

297
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,840
It's the mark of the Beika Department Store here!

298
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,440
Besides, doesn't it bother you that all the items were

299
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,240
bought at the same time, 12:28 pm?

300
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,440
I see! That's why the bomb man

301
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,140
is so sure that the sender is on this floor!

302
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,173
Because he found out that the sender

303
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:59,177
was buying the T-shirts here afternoon!

304
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,540
Wait a sec.

305
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,940
But why is this sports item floor?

306
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,540
Maybe because this T-shirt is an underwear?

307
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,740
"Underwear" -It's written on the receipt too.

308
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,040
You know, it's a polyester wear that is worn

309
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,040
when jogging that sucks up perspiration and dries quickly!

310
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,740
I get it!

311
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,840
Do you know where this is sold?

312
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,240
I think it's sold in the fitness wear section.

313
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,940
Please take us there!

314
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,209
Yes, sir. This way.

315
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,640
Strange.

316
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,940
The receipts till two weeks ago are torn,

317
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,540
so you can't tell where the items were bought.

318
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,240
Why did the sender make such a mistake just this week.

319
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,740
Besides...

320
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,940
What's the matter, Conan?

321
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,840
Did you notice something again?

322
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,340
Oh, yes...

323
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,940
I was thinking that this receipt is strange.

324
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,040
Strange?

325
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,239
Because... Look.

326
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,241
If the sender wanted to hide the place,

327
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,940
he could've just torn off the upper left part,

328
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,540
but the upper right part is torn off too.

329
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,249
Maybe this person is just not too reliable?

330
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,740
Even the T-shirts are folded messily.

331
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,840
-What? The way they're folded? -Yes.

332
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,040
See! There's a strange crease on this one T-shirt.

333
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,340
If you fold this T-shirt, according to the crease...

334
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,640
This is how it looks.

335
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,940
This is...

336
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,640
Couldn't it be...

337
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,940
What shall we do? Shall we force entry?

338
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,640
No, wait.

339
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
It seems that the bomb man said that if the police approach,

340
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,289
he would set the bomb off.

341
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,840
But...

342
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,293
According to the informant, the bombs are...

343
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,295
We can't rely on that information.

344
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:01,299
They may have said that just because they want to be safe.

345
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,301
We've got no choice now but to wait

346
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,040
for the bomb man to make his move.

347
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,140
Hey.

348
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,311
How long do I have to wait?

349
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,140
For a phantom that's not even around.

350
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,440
Hold horses, Chianti.

351
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
The info we got of a man who resembles Akai,

352
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,840
is going into the department store is certain.

353
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,740
I'm going to check with my own eyes

354
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,327
whether that guy is really a phantom or not.

355
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,540
If it turns out that he isn't a phantom,

356
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,740
in that exact moment,

357
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,540
you're going to become a phantom.

358
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,040
Kir.

359
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,680
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,880
"T-shirt"

361
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,660
There's no time left! Where's the culprit!

362
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,740
Darn it!

363
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,980
That's not it?
