1
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,748
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:09,448
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,248
The treasure of the Gods is finally found!

4
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:13,848
Did Thief Kid get it or did the Youth Detective Squad get it?

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,448
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,048
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:19,248
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:01,224
We came along to camp together with Dr. Agasa.

9
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,024
Genta and the others find a mysterious looking stone

10
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:06,124
near a suspicious looking mansion.

11
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:09,524
There are codes concerning the Big Jewel there.

12
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:11,324
And besides it,

13
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:13,624
we find a body of a man who had been strangled to death.

14
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:18,724
We then enter the mysterious looking mansion of tricks

15
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:21,324
where we encounter two treasure hunters

16
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,424
and an queer old woman.

17
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,624
I guess we'll have to find the other sacred treasure

18
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,924
to solve the mystery.

19
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,524
The other?

20
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:34,024
They're called the three sacred treasures.

21
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:37,224
The mirror and the comma-shaped bead were found,

22
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,424
so there should be one more somewhere.

23
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,424
The three sacred treasures?

24
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:44,324
Yes. The mirror is the Mirror of Yata,

25
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:47,424
the comma-shaped bead is called the Magatama of Yasakani.

26
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,224
And the remaining one

27
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:52,124
is the sword of the Gods.

28
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:55,424
It got its name because it is said to have saved God Takeru Yamato,

29
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,324
who was in a pinch

30
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,624
by slashing down the grass when fire was set to the field.

31
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:02,324
The Sword of Kusanagi.

32
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:09,324
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Case Closed"

33
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,724
I know about that Sword of Kusanagi!

34
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:15,824
It's the fantastic sword that comes out a lot in games, right?

35
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:18,524
The Sword of Kusanagi?

36
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:21,324
If we look at the writings on that sword,

37
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,124
we may be able to figure something out.

38
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,124
Before searching for the treasure,

39
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:31,824
I think our priority is to get out of this basement cell.

40
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:34,724
If it is about getting out of here,

41
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:37,124
he should know it.

42
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:43,224
Unless you already came here once and read the writings on the gravestone,

43
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:47,424
you wouldn't be hiding that stone mirror that you have on you.

44
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:48,624
Yes, yes.

45
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,224
Let me show you the way.

46
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:56,024
What a large house.

47
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:58,324
The basement is strangely large.

48
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:02,424
The floor's starting to get wet.

49
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:03,424
Yes.

50
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,124
Water is flowing in from somewhere.

51
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:07,024
There! Over there.

52
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:12,324
What's that trace that looks as if something had moved out of place.

53
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:17,024
Now that you mentioned it, there was an earthquake a little while ago.

54
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,424
That's why the house moved a bit, and water from below flowed out.

55
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:24,524
Just as Kichiemon says,

56
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:27,624
maybe God Nioh is angry.

57
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:31,624
Telling us to quit treasure hunting and quickly go back home.

58
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:40,024
Hey, the notebook that the man who was found in the swamp,

59
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,424
it's dry now and are readable.

60
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:46,824
It seems that he was killed by his partner.

61
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:49,224
"I've teamed up with a dangerous guy.

62
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:52,624
I've got to hide this stone I found, or he'll kill me.

63
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,624
Poison rat says he's going to kill me

64
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:57,624
and take the treasure all for himself."

65
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:01,324
After that, it's ripped so I can't read on.

66
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,424
Amazing!

67
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:09,824
Amazing!

68
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,124
Is this smoke comes from a hot spring or something?

69
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:18,124
Yes.

70
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:20,824
Kichiemon probably dug it up.

71
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:25,824
To hide this entrance with steam.

72
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,924
-I see. -Fantastic!

73
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:30,624
What a red hot spring.

74
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:33,024
I wonder if it contains a lot of iron?

75
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,324
Hey, brat!

76
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:37,324
That's not the exit.

77
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,524
Brat!

78
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:43,324
Conan, what's up?

79
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:46,924
Are you all right?

80
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,924
Hey, do you know?

81
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:51,524
Do you know where the Sword of Kusanagi came out from?

82
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:52,924
What?

83
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:57,824
I'm sure you've all heard about the story of Susano,

84
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,424
the kid brother of Oomikami Ametarasu,

85
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,424
making a monster drink sake to get it drunk

86
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:05,024
and eventually defeat it in order to rescue Princess Kushinada.

87
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:07,624
And the sword that came out of the tail of the monster

88
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:10,624
was the Sword of Ameno Murakumo,

89
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:12,924
which later became known as the Sword of Kusanagi.

90
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:14,924
Don't tell me that monster

91
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,624
is the one that often comes out in stories of long ago.

92
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:17,724
Yes.

93
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,124
Its eye are flaming red like those of an ogre

94
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:21,724
and its stomach is inflamed with blood.

95
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:22,724
Although it has just one body,

96
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:27,324
it is the legendary eight-headed dragon with eight heads and eight tails.

97
00:06:27,324 --> 00:06:29,124
Look at the basin of this waterfall.

98
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,524
Doesn't it look very similar...

99
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,424
to the eight-headed dragon?

100
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,424
I see.

101
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:44,924
The waterfall is the dragon's neck and the branches its tails.

102
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:48,224
Which means that the sword is in one of the branches?

103
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:52,624
Yes. According to the legend, the sword came out of the tail in the middle.

104
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:57,024
In other words, the Sword of Kusanagi should be up ahead of this branch.

105
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:59,524
Don't tell me you plan to dive through the hot water?

106
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:02,424
Forget it! There's nothing there.

107
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:05,524
What if it's the bottom of the valley up ahead?

108
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:09,324
But we came this far, so I want to see what there is up ahead.

109
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:24,224
Something is rising.

110
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:25,824
The water level is decreasing.

111
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,724
Now, we can go through the hole!

112
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:33,124
All right!

113
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:35,124
Okay! Let's go.

114
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:36,224
Hold it, Genta!

115
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,724
Out of my way!

116
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:42,224
Hey, Granny!

117
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:43,324
Darn it!

118
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:59,224
That is indeed the Sword of Kusanagi!

119
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,824
So you were after the treasure, too.

120
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,324
What a dangerous trap.

121
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:22,124
When you try to get close to the sword,

122
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:24,824
weight bears down on the floor and blades come flying from all directions.

123
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:27,024
I guess he doesn't want it to be taken, does he?

124
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:30,424
No, it's not just an ordinary mean trap.

125
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,724
Blades come from all directions.

126
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,724
Conan!

127
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,724
And the blades settling in all four directions

128
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:42,024
only goes to show that the timing is slightly synchronized

129
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,824
so that they won't bump into each other.

130
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,224
Moreover...

131
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:51,224
the fact that there is a handle like this on the blade,

132
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:56,424
is telling you to use it to go over to the sword!

133
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:05,124
He got to the other side!

134
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,524
Conan is amazing!

135
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:12,024
-What's written on it? -What's written on the sword?

136
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,424
Dragon.

137
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,524
-Dragon? -Dragon?

138
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:25,524
Forever, flames and dragon.

139
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,424
Just as expected of Kichiemon!

140
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,924
It probably means, suffer in agony forever

141
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:36,524
as if being burned by the flames of the dragon.

142
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:40,124
So let's forget about treasure hunting and go home.

143
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:44,124
Maybe there was no treasure to begin with anyway.

144
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,324
What's with you?

145
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:47,924
You were going all out to get it just a while ago.

146
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:53,424
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

147
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:55,724
Forever.

148
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,124
Flames.

149
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:59,424
Dragon.

150
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,324
"Offer me..."

151
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:05,024
"To me!"

152
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,824
Hey, Conan!

153
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,024
Conan!

154
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:13,324
Can you still come back here?

155
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:32,724
Oh, my.

156
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:36,524
You look satisfied. So, you've figured something out?

157
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:37,824
Really, Conan?

158
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:39,324
No.

159
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:41,324
This look on my face is a wretched look that says,

160
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:42,724
"Let's hurry up and head on home."

161
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,324
Are you serious?

162
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,024
Hey, Conan.

163
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,224
Are you serious about heading home?

164
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:55,224
After we found the mysterious three sacred treasures?

165
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:57,524
You're going to forget about the diamond?

166
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,424
The words that are carved on the sacred treasures,

167
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,124
flames, forever and dragon, as far as the meaning is concerned

168
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:08,424
and as to the meaning of the writings in the stone lantern,

169
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:10,624
I don't have the slightest idea.

170
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:13,024
I guess I'll get going then.

171
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:18,524
I guess I'll check this mansion a bit more, too.

172
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,624
We finally made it outside.

173
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:26,424
It seems Dr. Agasa hasn't come back yet.

174
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,724
Doctor?

175
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:32,224
Dr. Agasa is suppose to bring some police officers here.

176
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:37,724
I guess you'll be able to get out of these mountains even without me.

177
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,524
If you don't want God Nioh to curse you,

178
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:43,324
don't dilly-dally and head on home right away.

179
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:49,124
Now that all the people you don't want around have left,

180
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,024
lead the way, will you?

181
00:11:52,824 --> 00:11:54,324
To where the treasure is.

182
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,624
Come on, Conan.

183
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,179
Then, you...

184
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,779
You figured out the code!

185
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,879
It was written on the gravestone in the basement, right?

186
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,779
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

187
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,179
The "me" here refers to Kichiemon Samizu.

188
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,679
In other words, it's telling you to add the kanji character "Mizu"

189
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,479
to the characters of the sacred treasures.

190
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,179
The words that were found on the three sacred treasures

191
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,379
were "Hono" for flames...

192
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,979
And "El" for forever.

193
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,079
And "Ryu" for dragon!

194
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
What happens when you put "Sanzui" alongside it?

195
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,579
The character "Hono" for flames becomes "Awa" as in Awaji Island!

196
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,779
The character "El" becomes "ei", the character for the word swimming!

197
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,379
The character "Ryu" becomes "taki", the character for waterfall.

198
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,579
Does it mean to go swimming in the waterfall of Awaji Island?

199
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:55,379
It said on the gravestone in the basement "Lost ones", right?

200
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,379
That was a hint for those who couldn't figure out

201
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,579
the code of the stone lanterns.

202
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,779
The writing on the lantern said,

203
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,379
a place nearest to the sun,

204
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:05,579
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

205
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,879
When you put this together with the three characters,

206
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,679
the place nearest to the sun is Mercury,

207
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,179
the first planet in the solar system.

208
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:16,379
The elders refer to the carps with whiskers.

209
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,179
The busy place means a place where the sound of the water never stops.

210
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:27,679
In other words, the stone of the God Nioh, the diamond

211
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,479
is hidden near the waterfall where a lot of carps swim in fresh water!

212
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,879
Amazing, Conan!

213
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,279
It's the waterfall in the basement!

214
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,579
It's where the eight-headed dragon is.

215
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,979
Too bad. That's a hot spring and not fresh water.

216
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,479
Maybe it's the river that was in the house?

217
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:45,079
There were lots of carps swimming inside, too.

218
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,679
But there was no waterfall.

219
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,579
Oh, that's right.

220
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,979
Listen carefully.

221
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,479
You hear it, don't you?

222
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,179
It's leading us to where the treasure is.

223
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,779
That sound.

224
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,479
I see!

225
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,579
It's at the first swamp that we saw.

226
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:04,779
Let's go!

227
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,979
Okay!

228
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,379
Hey.

229
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,279
That body is gone.

230
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,379
Yes.

231
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,679
The killer hid it again after we entered the house.

232
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,879
What're you talking about?

233
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,179
About a body.

234
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,779
Do you see anything?

235
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,179
Well, it's dark and I can't tell unless I dive in there or something.

236
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,979
Too bad.

237
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:39,679
He seems to have gotten there before you.

238
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,279
Sarina.

239
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
Just when did she get here?

240
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,679
Look behind the waterfall.

241
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,579
Behind the waterfall?

242
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,079
There is a card or something up there.

243
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,779
"Thanks for the stone of the God Nioh."

244
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,779
Thief Kid?

245
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,179
-Oh, no. -No joke!

246
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,779
Seriously?

247
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:04,179
He is indeed the great thief under the heavens.

248
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:07,479
Well, if the stone was taken by the great thief that deceives the world,

249
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:11,179
I guess puppet maker Kichiemon couldn't have asked for more.

250
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:15,679
Granny, I thought you went home.

251
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,179
What's up?

252
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,579
Mitsuhiko!

253
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,479
Are you all right?

254
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,979
Let's pull out of here!

255
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,379
There seems to be nothing here.

256
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,079
I found something!

257
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,479
It was hidden in the mud,

258
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,579
but there was definitely a stone that was shining

259
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,979
at the bottom of the swamp.

260
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,579
It's mine!

261
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,979
Hey! Don't take it!

262
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,679
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

263
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,379
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

264
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,179
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

265
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,979
Proverb of long ago...

266
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,479
Don't move!

267
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,079
Who would've thought it was hidden with mud?

268
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,079
I didn't search that well and was about to overlook it,

269
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,079
thanks to that card.

270
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,079
Go on, line up on that side!

271
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,979
When that man comes out from the water holding the treasure,

272
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,579
I'll give you all a good dunk in the water together.

273
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,179
You've finally shown your true identity.

274
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,479
Thief Kid!

275
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,579
She is?

276
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,179
I'm the Thief Kid?

277
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:52,579
Don't be silly, I'm...

278
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,479
You're the poison rat that killed your partner

279
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:58,579
in order to hog the treasure all for yourself, right?

280
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,279
When that guy showed the stone mirror, you said...

281
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,679
Which means that the one that you kids found

282
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,779
had something like flames carved on it?

283
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:13,979
Isn't that right?

284
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,479
Back then, all I said was I found a stone sacred treasure.

285
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,179
So how did you know

286
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,879
that what we found was not the sword, but the comma-shaped bead?

287
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:26,679
You knew because you're the one who tore off the page from the notebook

288
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,579
of the man that you sunk to the bottom of the swamp.

289
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:31,779
You took the diagram that showed that the character flames

290
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:34,679
was written inside the comma-shaped bead.

291
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,079
How did you find out what was written?

292
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,179
The notes were written in pencil,

293
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,179
so you could see slight traces on the paper.

294
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,379
So you're a bit smart.

295
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,079
But also careless, kid.

296
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,779
You come close to the gun barrel from your side.

297
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,879
Right. I had to do this...

298
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,079
or else that anesthetic needle won't hit you directly.

299
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,979
But that was suprising.

300
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:20,179
That woman is Thief Kid.

301
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,879
No. Thief Kid is...

302
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,979
I've got the stone of the God Nioh!

303
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,579
No!

304
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,479
Hurry and put the diamond back where it was!

305
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,479
What?

306
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,179
Otherwise you'll drift down to the bottom of the valley

307
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,379
together with the water!

308
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,879
There it is.

309
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,579
It's that mansion!

310
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:31,179
That diamond was the switch to this huge trap.

311
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:35,979
He had no intention of letting anybody have the treasure to begin with.

312
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:40,979
Yes. Diamonds, because of their impenetrable hardness,

313
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,079
once used to be called adamas from which the word adamant,

314
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,479
meaning utterly unyielding was derived.

315
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,479
Therefore, learn from the proverb of long ago

316
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,579
means the treasure shall never be taken.

317
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,979
Well, when the Shogunate collapsed,

318
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:54,679
not wanting the ones who overthrew the government to confiscate his assets,

319
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,679
it's most likely that Kichiemon thought this up.

320
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,179
That's why you stole it once but decided against it. Right, granny?

321
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,279
Or rather, the greatest thief under the heavens.

322
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,479
There he is!

323
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,579
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

324
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,679
Exactly. Good work.

325
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,279
The wall of the mansion that was slightly raised, and the basement passage

326
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,879
that was slightly out of place where the water came gushing out.

327
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:32,879
Contrary to what was written on the card, the jewel was not taken.

328
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:37,479
And shouting, "Don't take it!" all points

329
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:41,479
to none other than the fact that granny is Thief Kid.

330
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:43,379
Bingo!

331
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:48,479
Well, I didn't take it also because it was not what I was after.

332
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:52,579
That's why you said, "Let's forget about the treasure hunt and go home."

333
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:57,379
But you knocked me down and tried to take the sword.

334
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,479
That was to rescue you, Genta.

335
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,879
If he didn't go in before you and make you realize there was a trap there,

336
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:05,579
you would've been slashed to pieces.

337
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:11,279
So he waited for us in the basement

338
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,679
so that we wouldn't get caught by the traps?

339
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:13,879
My, my.

340
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,979
What a heart-warming and touching thief we have.

341
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:20,179
I'm truly honored by your words, little lady.

342
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,579
Well, I'll let you go for today since you rescued my friends from danger.

343
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:29,379
But I'll expose you to the light of day for sure someday,

344
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:30,579
so don't forget that.

345
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,279
I'll peel off that cape of yours as well as make you show yourself.

346
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,579
I advise you not to.

347
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:45,679
Pandora opened the box because she didn't know what was inside.

348
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,579
Knowing the contents before opening the treasure box...

349
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:56,179
is no fun.

350
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,379
You idiot.

351
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:04,679
It's the work of a detective

352
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,779
to find out what's inside before opening the box.

353
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,979
So, what now?

354
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,479
That's right.

355
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:42,079
Since the jewel was returned, it seems the water is receding.

356
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,379
I guess we have no choice but to wait for help to come.

357
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:46,979
What happened to Dr. Agasa?

358
