1
00:00:02,998 --> 00:00:04,298
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:06,098
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:07,498
A novelist's life is sought after by a character

4
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:08,898
that appears in her novel!

5
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,698
Is this fiction or non-fiction?

6
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,198
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:13,798
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,698
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:59,998
"Pro Soccer"

10
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,298
They're calling.

11
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,498
Pops?

12
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,598
Excuse me...

13
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:16,198
Inspector!

14
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,498
I have a feeling it's time to make an appearance!

15
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:21,498
Here goes!

16
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:22,698
Hey!

17
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,798
-Pops! -Inspector!

18
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:30,798
You must really have a lot of time on your hands.

19
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:34,598
No, this brat tells me in tears to go help

20
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:36,798
with the invitation so.

21
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:42,498
Inspector, what kind of case is this?

22
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:43,698
Homicide.

23
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,198
The victim is the person who lives in this unit.

24
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:51,398
Ms. Murako Saikawa, age 65.

25
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:52,798
She's living alone.

26
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,398
She looks to be a novelist.

27
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:58,298
Do you know her, Mouri?

28
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:00,898
Murako Saikawa...

29
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:04,898
Come to think of it, there was a novelist by the name some time ago.

30
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,498
Murako Saikawa...

31
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,498
"The Village of Orochi"

32
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:16,198
Was a once famous mystery writer.

33
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:17,798
She died instantly after being struck

34
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,898
in the back of the head with a bronze figurine.

35
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:20,998
From the looks of the corpse,

36
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:25,598
she was probably killed last night between 7 pm to 9 pm.

37
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,298
As to the estimated time of death,

38
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:30,798
I'm sure we'll be able to find out more in detail after the autopsy.

39
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:34,198
Who would want to kill that famed mystery writer?

40
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:35,298
And for what reason?

41
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:42,398
"My Favorite Mystery"

42
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:43,898
Inspector.

43
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,598
They are the two people who first found the body.

44
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,498
"Shunichi Tono (26)" -I'm Tono. I'm editor from Meikyu Publishing

45
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:50,698
and was in charge of Ms. Saikawa.

46
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,398
And he is the manager of the apartment.

47
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:54,998
"Keizo Murata (55)" -I'm Murata.

48
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,098
Please explain how things were when you first found the body once again.

49
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:01,198
When I came to make arrangements here yesterday,

50
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,498
she asked me to bring her some documents today.

51
00:04:03,498 --> 00:04:07,198
But despite pushing the doorbell many times there was no answer.

52
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,698
So I sensed that something was not right.

53
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:12,198
So I went to call the apartment manager,

54
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:15,098
had him open the door and entered the room.

55
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:16,298
Ms. Saikawa?

56
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:19,898
We saw Ms. Saikawa lying over there...

57
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:21,898
I see.

58
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:24,898
Mr. Tono, were you at Ms. Saikawa's yesterday too?

59
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,298
Yes, I was.

60
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:29,698
From sundown to around 8 pm.

61
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:33,398
The murder was committed between 7 pm to 9 pm.

62
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,598
You've got great intuition?

63
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:38,998
I mean, you felt that something was not right,

64
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,898
only because after pushing the doorbell, nobody answered, right?

65
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:42,898
That's true.

66
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,498
Most people normally wouldn't think that way right off the bat.

67
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,898
Oh, well...

68
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,498
That's because several days ago,

69
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,698
Ms. Saikawa received this.

70
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:53,398
A postcard?

71
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:58,398
"Dear Ms. Murako Saikawa,"

72
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:03,198
"I'm thinking of adding your life to my collection next."

73
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:06,198
"I will go to visit you in the near future to take your life."

74
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,598
A murder warning?

75
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,798
The sender is...

76
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:13,898
Taniyoshi Ohebi?

77
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,798
It's read, Ryo Orochiya.

78
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:17,398
Ryo Orochiya?

79
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,398
It can't be!

80
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:22,198
"Ryo Orochiya" -Who is this Orochiya person?

81
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,498
He is a genius killer

82
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,098
that appears in one of Ms. Saikawa's main novels.

83
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:30,298
He's somebody who appears in her novel?

84
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,198
The novelist was killed by a character that appears in her novel?

85
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,398
No darn way!

86
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,198
Oh, I guess not.

87
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:40,098
But, that's what actually happened.

88
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:42,098
It's a cheap trick that the killer is using.

89
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,498
To complicate investigations!

90
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:46,698
To complicate investigations?

91
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:49,798
I wonder if anyone would do something like this just for that purpose.

92
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:51,998
Mr. Murata, if you have a vacant room,

93
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:54,298
could you lend it to us?

94
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:56,498
I would like to use the room as a stronghold for investigation.

95
00:05:56,498 --> 00:05:58,398
Oh, yes.

96
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:01,198
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

97
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:06,398
Mr. Tono, I think you're probably the last person who met the victim.

98
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,898
Could you spare us a little more of your time?

99
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,298
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:11,398
Inspector.

101
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:14,798
Yeah.

102
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:17,798
You said that the door was locked, didn't you?

103
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,798
I guess the killer locked the door when escaping last night.

104
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,998
In order to delay discovery of the body.

105
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:32,798
But, it seems that at this apartment the residents are given two keys.

106
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:36,898
And both of Ms. Saikawa's keys were found in the room.

107
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,098
The killer used a spare key?

108
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,198
Yes.

109
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:43,998
And if someone did use a spare key, the number of people

110
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:45,298
who can do so is limited.

111
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:47,998
For example, the editor in charge

112
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,698
who used to come make arrangements with her.

113
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:52,298
He could make one, if he waited for the chance to do so.

114
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,198
The manager also has a key.

115
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:00,698
Megure here.

116
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,798
Okay...

117
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,998
Got it.

118
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:05,098
Anything?

119
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:07,198
It's from Mr. Kawanaka who's going around the neighborhood

120
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:09,098
asking question looking for a lead.

121
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,398
He says that somebody heard the victim and the manager

122
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,998
having a heated argument several days ago.

123
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:18,398
It seems that the suspects have been narrowed down already.

124
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:22,098
Mr. Tono was here at the time the murder was committed.

125
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,698
Mr. Murata seems to have a motive to commit the murder.

126
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:28,898
And the two men could get spare keys of the room if they wanted to.

127
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:32,298
And if either of the two is the killer.

128
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,198
It may not be a coincidence that the first to ones

129
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,498
to discover the body were the two.

130
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,298
In order to get rid of the evidence they left behind the day before,

131
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:44,598
they snuck in here pretending to be the first to discover the body?

132
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,598
It's very probable.

133
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:56,098
What?

134
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:58,298
It's just a slice of fresh marinated ginger slices.

135
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:01,798
Ms. Saikawa hated fresh marinated ginger slices.

136
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:05,498
She used to say she didn't like the sweet sour taste of it.

137
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:08,498
That's why I think that after having sushi delivered here last night,

138
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,898
she disposed of the ginger slices without eating them.

139
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,998
Ms. Saikawa ordered delivery sushi last night?

140
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:18,298
Yes. I ordered it because Ms. Saikawa asked me to.

141
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,898
Inspector, the room is ready.

142
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,498
Oh, I see. Good work!

143
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:24,998
Then, Mr. Tono,

144
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:27,998
will you tell us in detail what happened last night?

145
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:28,998
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:32,798
If it was thrown away last night,

147
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:36,098
it would've been left there for half a day.

148
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,298
If so, then most naturally...

149
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:44,498
Ms. Saikawa was killed last night between 7 pm to 9 pm.

150
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:49,798
I came here last night around 6:30 pm.

151
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,598
Although she has stopped writing now,

152
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:57,398
Ms. Saikawa has written many masterpieces so far.

153
00:08:57,398 --> 00:09:00,598
We talked things over for about an hour

154
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:02,498
on making a compilation of her masterpieces.

155
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:03,998
This is the Saikawa residence.

156
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:05,898
Yes, of Pearl Mansion.

157
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:09,098
One serving of the usual prime sushi plate.

158
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:12,298
The sushi came at about 8 pm.

159
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,398
But I had another place to stop by

160
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:16,098
so I left soon afterwards.

161
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:20,098
I'll bring the documents you wanted tomorrow morning.

162
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,298
Thank you.

163
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:23,098
Well, then. Excuse me.

164
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,898
At around 8:15 pm,

165
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:31,998
I joined my friends at a pub in front of the station.

166
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:34,498
And stayed there all the way through till midnight.

167
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:36,998
"6:30: Business meeting with Mr. Tono" -All through till midnight...

168
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:38,198
"7:30: Ordered sushi, 8.00: Sushi delivered"

169
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:39,598
"8:15: Mr. Tono left, meeting up with friends"

170
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:42,898
I will have to confirm what you said with your friends too.

171
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,898
I know that you suspect me.

172
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:49,898
But how could I do something like that

173
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:52,198
to Japan's jewel of mystery?

174
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:56,898
I didn't have any brawl with Ms. Saikawa!

175
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:58,798
Somebody saw wrong!

176
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,898
It could be.

177
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,998
Then, what about last night?

178
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:05,198
I was in the manager's room right through.

179
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:09,398
I was alone, so there's no one to prove it, though.

180
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:12,398
That manager's hiding something.

181
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:14,498
8 pm is the point of focus.

182
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,398
If between 7 pm and 8 pm,

183
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,798
Mr. Tono could've committed the crime.

184
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,998
If after 8 pm, Mr. Murata could've committed the crime too.

185
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,098
Well, split up and find back ups for everyone's testimony!

186
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:25,098
-Yes sir! -Yes sir!

187
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:26,498
"Treasure sushi, Not yet open for business." -What?

188
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,198
Ms. Saikawa was?

189
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:31,198
I hear that you delivered a take-out meal to her last night.

190
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,598
How stupid of me!

191
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:37,198
Excuse me?

192
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:40,398
It's the mistake of a life time!

193
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:43,198
Why don't you spit it all out?

194
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,098
-The squid and octopus... -What?

195
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,698
Squid and octopus?

196
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,798
We don't usually put squid and octopus

197
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:53,398
in our prime sushi plate.

198
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:58,698
But we used to specially put them in Ms. Saikawa's order only.

199
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:01,898
Because she used to like them both.

200
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:05,798
But I carelessly forgot to put them on her plate last night!

201
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,198
I mean, no big deal...

202
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,998
What do you mean it's no big deal?

203
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:12,298
I goofed on the last order, you know!

204
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:15,098
I can't face up to Ms. Saikawa.

205
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:18,798
I would like to ask you about the time you delivered the order to her.

206
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:19,798
Yes?

207
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:22,598
He didn't see her?

208
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:27,198
Yeah, he definitely delivered the sushi to her at 8 pm,

209
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:30,098
but he says he didn't see Ms. Saikawa

210
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:32,698
or hear her voice at all.

211
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:36,798
At that time, she was no longer in the world.

212
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:39,898
That's a possibility.

213
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,498
Excuse me.

214
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:46,498
Who are you?

215
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,398
No, chief editor, please don't!

216
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:49,498
Let me go!

217
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:57,598
"Yasunobu Shimasaki (50)" -I'm Shimasaki, Head of Meikyu Publishing.

218
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:00,498
I hear that you are considering Mr. Tono a suspect?

219
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:01,898
Oh, no...

220
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:05,298
He's a guy that came to work for our company

221
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:08,798
that specializes in mysteries because he adored Ms. Saikawa, you know?

222
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:13,098
He even planned the compilation of Ms. Saikawa's stories this time too.

223
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:15,098
Yeah...

224
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:18,698
So, he was a fervent fan of Murako Saikawa?

225
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:22,198
Did you know the novelist called Murako Saikawa?

226
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:24,098
Not until this incident...

227
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:27,798
Because she's a forgotten novelist, that's why.

228
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:28,998
But he's the one who insisted,

229
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,298
if so the more the reason to publish her stories.

230
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:36,398
The public know much too little of how great Ms. Saikawa is.

231
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:39,298
Creative and unique tricks and a perfect composition.

232
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,398
-I have my mind set on letting entire Japan -To be honest with you,

233
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:44,098
-become aware of her jewel-like sparkle! -I don't think it'll sell much.

234
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,698
Our management is always in dire straits.

235
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:49,398
If we publish a compilation that is unlikely to sell,

236
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,198
it'll only make things worse.

237
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,098
But, I agreed.

238
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,698
I was moved by his wanting to make her happy

239
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:59,998
for the very last time with his heart and soul.

240
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:01,198
For the very last time?

241
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,098
The doctor had told her that.

242
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:08,598
She only had only six more months to live.

243
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:13,598
The one who would be most vexed by Ms. Saikawa's death is Tono!

244
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:15,998
Excuse me.

245
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:18,998
Megure here.

246
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,298
Oh, from Beika Medical University Hospital.

247
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,598
Yes...

248
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:26,198
Okay, thank you very much.

249
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,398
We've got the result of the autopsy.

250
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,998
There seems to have been a little rice grain

251
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:35,298
and raw seafood left in the stomach of the body.

252
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,098
Sushi, I guess?

253
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:42,298
Yeah. She seems to have been killed an hour after eating.

254
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:45,398
Since the food was delivered at 8 pm.

255
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:52,398
She was killed around 9 pm.

256
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,698
So, as for Mr. Tono.

257
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,598
Since he was with his friends right through after 8:15 pm,

258
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:01,198
his alibi has already been established.

259
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,398
Alibi established?

260
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:05,698
We're sorry to have suspected you.

261
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:07,498
You may leave.

262
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,398
-I'm happy for you, Tono. -Thank you.

263
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:11,998
Goodbye then.

264
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:14,998
Then, who's the killer?

265
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,598
What? You saw him last night?

266
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:18,998
Is it true?

267
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,098
Yes.

268
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:22,598
I had a package I had to deliver at a designated time.

269
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:24,998
So it was when I came to deliver it.

270
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,698
I'm sure it was just around 9 pm.

271
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,098
9 pm?

272
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,698
I really love this.

273
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:40,198
But that old lady found me sipping this since afternoon.

274
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:42,498
And she said she would report it to the maintenance company.

275
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:46,298
No way, if she does, I'll be fired!

276
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,798
That's why last night,

277
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:51,298
I went to see her to ask her not to report me.

278
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:52,798
But!

279
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:54,398
No matter how many times I rang the doorbell,

280
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:55,898
that old lady wouldn't answer.

281
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,398
If you insist on suspecting me,

282
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,398
show me proof, won't you?

283
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,998
Show me proof!

284
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:02,698
Mr. Murata!

285
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,398
You smell of liquor.

286
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,698
Let me go and air the room out a bit?

287
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:15,098
"The autopsy report"

288
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,298
"Stomach residue: Rice grain, tuna, octopus, squid, egg..."

289
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,698
I get it! There was one more...

290
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,498
And that marinated ginger slices.

291
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,998
I need proof...

292
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,298
I got it.

293
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,698
I've figured out the trick the killer used.

294
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:42,344
I've figured out the trick.

295
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,844
But why would he kill her?

296
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,444
Inspector.

297
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:52,244
From among the things that the forensic officers gathered,

298
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,244
nothing points to Mr. Murata as having committed the crime.

299
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:57,644
Nothing, huh?

300
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:00,444
Yes... There it is, clearly and bold letters.

301
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:03,444
"Mystery-novel authoress murdered!" -It's an attention catching headline,

302
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:05,244
"Murako Saikawa's own character sent a murder notice!" -isn't it?

303
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:11,144
Murder warning sent from a character in her novel?

304
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:15,744
Mr. Tono, told the press about the postcard too, didn't he?

305
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:16,844
It's supposed to be kept a secret

306
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,744
while investigation is underway and yet...

307
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:22,444
I see. So this is why.

308
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:32,544
Mouri?

309
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,144
Is it the usual?

310
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:38,744
Mouri!

311
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:40,744
Inspector Megure.

312
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:44,644
Please tell Mr. Tono and Mr. Murata to come back here again.

313
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:47,544
I've figured out the entire mystery!

314
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:48,644
Takagi! Chiba!

315
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,044
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

316
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,644
Inspector, the killer used an alibi trick.

317
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:57,544
An alibi trick?

318
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,544
Let me organize this case.

319
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:07,444
Ms. Saikawa was killed between 7 pm and 9 pm last night.

320
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:12,544
And we also know that it was an hour after she had eaten the sushi.

321
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:14,644
In other words, she was killed around 9 pm.

322
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:16,544
That's the point.

323
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:19,344
How can you be so sure?

324
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:21,844
Because the sushi was delivered to her place at 8 pm.

325
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:25,144
But, that doesn't mean that the sushi

326
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,244
that was found in Ms. Saikawa's stomach was the sushi that was delivered?

327
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:28,344
Just what do you mean?

328
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:30,544
There was another sushi package.

329
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:32,044
Another package?

330
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:34,944
Other than the sushi that was delivered here at 8 pm,

331
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:36,444
there was another package

332
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,744
that Mr. Tono had brought along with him as a present.

333
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,044
The sushi that Ms. Saikawa had eaten

334
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:46,044
was in fact the gift sushi that Mr. Tono had brought along.

335
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:50,044
She ate the sushi, not after 8 pm but at 6:30 pm.

336
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:54,844
And an hour later, Ms. Saikawa was killed by Mr. Tono.

337
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:59,444
This is when Ms. Saikawa's digestive system stopped functioning.

338
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,944
It stopped at an hour after she had eaten the sushi.

339
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:05,944
After this, Mr. Tono ordered sushi delivery.

340
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:09,244
Yes, please deliver one order of the usual prime sushi plate.

341
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,144
Thank you for your patronage!

342
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,644
You probably put the sushi that arrived at 8 pm

343
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:16,044
into a plastic bag or something.

344
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:19,244
And locked the door using a spare key that you prepared before hand,

345
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:21,544
to delay discovery of the body.

346
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:24,644
You got rid of the sushi and spare key on the way.

347
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:27,944
And went on to establish your alibi from after 8:15 pm.

348
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:31,344
But, we finally got word after the autopsy that she was killed

349
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,244
after she had eaten the sushi.

350
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,144
Since the sushi was delivered at 8 pm, so...

351
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:38,544
This most naturally lead us to think

352
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:41,144
that the time the murder was committed was 9 pm.

353
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:43,744
As a result, Mr. Tono who had an alibi during that time

354
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:46,144
was cleared from the list of suspects.

355
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:48,544
I had things figured out till that point.

356
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,844
In other words, he used the result of the autopsy

357
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:55,244
that is used to help solve cases

358
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:58,144
to his advantage for his alibi trick.

359
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,144
So, you!

360
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:01,244
Wait a second, Mr. Mouri!

361
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:03,444
However, you made one mistake!

362
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,044
The slices of ginger.

363
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,944
If the slices were ones that came along with the sushi

364
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,944
that was delivered last night,

365
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,144
they would've been dried out long out.

366
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:14,344
But, the slices of ginger that were found in the disposal

367
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,644
were still soft. Why?

368
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:19,544
Because when you got rid of the sushi that was delivered last night,

369
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:22,244
you carelessly also threw away the slices of ginger.

370
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,444
You realized what you did this morning,

371
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,644
so you made Mr. Murata open the room

372
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,744
and when he wasn't watching, you went to the kitchen

373
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:32,544
and threw the slices of ginger you had on you

374
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,044
into the triangular disposal basket.

375
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,844
That's enough!

376
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:38,344
What gift sushi are you talking about?

377
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,844
Of course, Ms. Saikawa ate the sushi

378
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:43,544
that was delivered at 8 pm!

379
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:44,844
Inspector.

380
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:50,144
What was left in Ms. Saikawa's stomach after the autopsy?

381
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:52,244
Like I said, sushi.

382
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:55,144
We got more detailed information, didn't we?

383
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:57,844
What? Oh, let see...

384
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:03,444
Rice, tuna, sea urchin, flatfish, squid and octopus.

385
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,144
Squid and octopus?

386
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:07,244
Yeah, no mistake about it.

387
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:09,944
Isn't it strange, Officer Takagi?

388
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:10,944
Strange?

389
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,544
Yes! It's strange!

390
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,144
How stupid of me!

391
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:18,444
The squid and octopus...

392
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,244
He forgot to put in on the plate?

393
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:26,344
You probably made sure that the squid and octopus

394
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:30,144
that Ms. Saikawa liked was in the sushi gift that you brought for her.

395
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:34,444
You assumed the sushi's fillings, didn't you?

396
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:36,844
You were proven guilty by the autopsy that you schemed

397
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:39,244
to use to your advantage.

398
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:40,444
Tono, you...

399
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,944
Admit your crime, Mr. Tono.

400
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,044
The criminals that Ms. Murako Saikawa writes

401
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,044
in her books including Ryo Orochiya

402
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:49,844
all admit their crimes in good grace,

403
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:52,044
when they are cornered, don't they?

404
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,244
Why, Tono?

405
00:20:56,344 --> 00:21:00,344
Ms. Saikawa had only a few months to live because of her illness.

406
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:03,244
But, if she dies of an illness,

407
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:07,544
nobody would make anything of a writer who is long forgotten.

408
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,444
However, if she were killed

409
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:14,644
and more so by one of the characters who appeared in her books.

410
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:17,944
The media would make a big thing of it.

411
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,444
It would make Ms. Saikawa's name known to the public.

412
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:24,744
Therefore, you wrote that strange postcard warning of the murder

413
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:26,744
and carried it out.

414
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,244
No matter what the motive,

415
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:31,744
taking another person's life is totally unforgivable!

416
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:33,944
But, in Ms. Saikawa's case,

417
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,044
-there wouldn't have been a better way... -Tono!

418
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,644
Did you really do it only for Ms. Saikawa's sake?

419
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,444
If people are attracted, the compilation of her work will sell

420
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,944
and the company you work for will benefit.

421
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:45,444
Didn't you also have that in mind?

422
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:48,844
I wanted to protect Meikyu Publishing,

423
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:52,144
the fortress of mystery.

424
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,744
Tono...

425
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,144
You idiot!

426
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:57,744
Mr. Shimasaki!

427
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:03,644
Those who really love mysteries

428
00:22:03,644 --> 00:22:07,444
never take the life of others.

429
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:45,344
What? The manager of this apartment changed.

430
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:47,444
I'm not surprised.

431
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:49,844
If the manager was drinking from daytime,

432
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:52,444
he wouldn't be able to fulfill his duties.

433
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,044
Don't want to waste a drop!

434
00:23:57,244 --> 00:24:00,244
A detective can fulfill his duties despite drinking though?

435
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,160
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,220
"Name in katakana character"

437
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,140
How do you write your name in kanji, Conan?

438
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,320
"Co" the kanji meaning moth orchid

439
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,820
-and "nan" the kanji meaning difficult... -What?
