1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,840
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,440
Today's episode is about a visitor from France.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,640
The will to kill harmonizes in the melody of the piano.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,390
"Nocturne of Red Will to Kill (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,490
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,790
"The Kana Amusement Group"

11
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,390
"Yoshinori Kana" -The Kana Amusement Group is a very big company.

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,790
What would the chairman of such a company want to talk to me about?

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,590
Well, we're going to be making Gerald Tenma's CD at our company.

14
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,990
And, we're going to be holding a private party

15
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,490
upon the signing of the contract.

16
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,490
How nice, Mr. Tenma is finally going to make his Japan debut?

17
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,790
-Do you know him? -Of course.

18
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,590
He's a mysterious singer that is the talk of the French world of Chanson.

19
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,590
No one knows anything about his personal history, isn't that right?

20
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,490
I'm amazed that you know.

21
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,090
Ever since that day, we decided on the day of the party,

22
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,890
eerie things have been happening around his wife, Misaki.

23
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,690
Eerie things happening?

24
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,790
Repeated phone calls without no caller responding.

25
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,390
Rose bouquets sent by an unknown sender.

26
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,090
This letter came with the bouquet of roses.

27
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,490
Blackmail.

28
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,190
Those who do not realize my love,

29
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,290
will surely fall to the pits of despair.

30
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,790
We got the other one yesterday.

31
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,990
The curtains will be opened to commence the party of revenge.

32
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,390
Enjoy a party of terror to your heart's content.

33
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,090
The party will be held in three days.

34
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,490
We can't cancel it now and I'm also worried about my wife.

35
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,190
Do you have any idea who this may be?

36
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,290
We are carrying out contract procedures secretly.

37
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,990
Therefore, the only ones who know that there is going to be a party

38
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,590
are my wife and I,

39
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,890
and the other four who are scheduled to attend.

40
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,090
"Three days later" -You left me behind all alone,

41
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,190
but I still haven't forgotten you.

42
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,290
My eyes are always on you.

43
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,090
I hear your voice and I am just so delighted.

44
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,590
What on earth is that?

45
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,790
Oh come on! It's the Japanese lyrics

46
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,990
to Mr. Tenma's "Nocturne of Red Love."

47
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,290
I'll send you a flower a day.

48
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,190
A red rose, a marigold, a roberia,

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,390
a bright red dahlia, and a love song...

50
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,390
You are forever mine.

51
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,690
I wonder what she likes about a song like this?

52
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,990
I'm so happy that I'm going to get to see Mr. Tenma.

53
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,290
This is work now, remember, work!

54
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,490
We're supposed to be members of the Morita family,

55
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,390
a friend of the chairman, understand.

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,490
All right, all right.

57
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,890
I can't have them finding out that I'm a top-notch detective.

58
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,190
Don't worry, because you don't look like one.

59
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,490
Really, you two better behave yourselves.

60
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,390
That's for me to say, not you.

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,690
Going from the gate to the entrance of the house by car,

62
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,290
is like what I've seen in movies from abroad.

63
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,490
This is really some house.

64
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,490
They must be millionaires.

65
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,190
Doesn't it look like a castle that comes out in horror movies?

66
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,190
Oh, no. Thunder.

67
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,290
It was such a fine day until just a while ago, and now it's so...

68
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,090
Didn't you want to see Gerald?

69
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,690
Being scared is another thing.

70
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,790
Mr. Morita?

71
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,990
Yes, I'm Morita. The one that was invited.

72
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,990
Thank you for coming.

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,190
Please come in.

74
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,190
Mr. Morita.

75
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,790
I've been waiting for you.

76
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,690
Thank you for inviting us.

77
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,190
Thank you for coming.

78
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,590
She is my secretary.

79
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,190
Masayo Tokudaiji.

80
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,190
How do you do?

81
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,290
It's nice to meet you.

82
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,190
This is the reception room.

83
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,190
Oh, well, well.

84
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,990
The art work here is also fantastic.

85
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,790
It's all my wife's taste.

86
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,590
Come this way please.

87
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,890
May I take a look around your residence before doing so?

88
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,690
Sure.

89
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,290
Ms. Tokudaiji!

90
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,790
Please show them around.

91
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,390
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,490
No.

93
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,390
I'll show them around.

94
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,190
She is my wife, Misaki.

95
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,790
She is the president of the group company, Kana Music Publisher.

96
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,990
"Misaki Kana (32)" -How do you do? Let's go.

97
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,090
Yes.

98
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,790
Please prepare things in the kitchen, Masayo.

99
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,790
Your wife doesn't like me,

100
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,190
does she, chairman?

101
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,290
Hey, you...

102
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,290
This is the room right above the large reception hall.

103
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,890
The room beyond is the piano room.

104
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,090
How wonderful.

105
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,590
You even have a spiral corridor within the house.

106
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,790
This sword...

107
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,390
Hey!

108
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,990
Don't you dare touch it!

109
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,890
It's not all that fragile.

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,590
Although it's decoration,

111
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,690
it is made of the same materials and in the same way as the real thing.

112
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,690
In other words, it's the real thing?

113
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,390
The room next to the piano room is mine.

114
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,090
Come, this way please.

115
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,390
This room is also of good taste.

116
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,590
A picture of your wedding?

117
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,290
How beautiful.

118
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,690
It was taken 10 years ago today in Fiji.

119
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,290
How nice.

120
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,690
We belonged to the same music club in our university days.

121
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,190
We went steady for a year and then got married.

122
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,690
My, how I envy you.

123
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,490
Hello.

124
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,290
Who is it?

125
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,490
Who is this?

126
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,890
The person hung up.

127
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,190
Hello.

128
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,490
It hung up.

129
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,090
Does this kind of thing happen often?

130
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,890
Yes. In a hoarse man's voice,

131
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,590
things like "Mon amie" and "Je taime" are whispered.

132
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,890
And when I answer, the phone is hung up immediately.

133
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,590
You have no idea who it is?

134
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,790
That's not all.

135
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,490
Together with a letter,

136
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,090
I got this too.

137
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,490
Was this taken without you being aware?

138
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,090
This is what I found together with the bunch of Marigold

139
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,090
I found it at the front door this morning.

140
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,990
This seems to have been taken yesterday.

141
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,390
I feel like someone is always watching me

142
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,890
that I'm scared.

143
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,290
After the rose is the marigold.

144
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,090
Always being watched.

145
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,890
Worry no more.

146
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,690
I will protect you Misaki over my dead body.

147
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,090
Chairman, the guests have arrived.

148
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,890
All right. I'll be right there.

149
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,790
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

150
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,590
Thank you so much for coming.

151
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,090
Yoshinori, this is Gerald Tenma's manager.

152
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,590
I'm Michelle, nice to meet you.

153
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,090
This is my older brother, Yoshinori Kana,

154
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,890
and his wife, Misaki.

155
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,990
How do you do?

156
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,290
Thank you for coming.

157
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,390
Where is Mr. Tenma?

158
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,590
I'm sorry, he had some other work to attend

159
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,690
so he will arrive here in about 30 minutes.

160
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,390
Yoshinori, who are they?

161
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,590
He is my old friend, Mr. Morita.

162
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,190
They are his children, Ran and Conan.

163
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,490
Mr. Morita, he is my younger brother, Hideki.

164
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,090
He is the vice president of Kana Music Publishers.

165
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,090
Yoshinori, may I have a word with you?

166
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,090
What is it?

167
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,590
Excuse me.

168
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,090
Please come this way and have a seat.

169
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,590
What delicious looking dishes.

170
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,790
Don't forget why we're here.

171
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,490
Why did you invite outsiders here?

172
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,590
This is an important time when we have to sign a contract with Gerald.

173
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,590
The contract?

174
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,490
You leave for France on your own and suddenly bring Gerald along.

175
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,790
Thinking of the company,

176
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,090
I don't see anything wrong in what I did.

177
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,390
For the company? I guess so,

178
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,790
because if this doesn't work out,

179
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,090
you can't make yourself look good to Misaki.

180
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,490
What a thing to say!

181
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,290
I hear you've been making passes to Misaki persistently.

182
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,190
Who said such a thing?

183
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,190
How about you and Ms. Tokudaiji, Yoshinori?

184
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,290
The rumor is going around all over the company.

185
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,490
Don't be ridiculous!

186
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,190
There is nothing going between her and me!

187
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,590
Anyway! I'm going to make this contract go through

188
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,090
no matter what it takes.

189
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,690
It's about time for Gerald to arrive.

190
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,690
I'll go wait for him by the front door.

191
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,890
Let me go with you.

192
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,190
I'll go to the restroom before that.

193
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,190
Please get the next dish ready, will you?

194
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,390
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,390
You don't have anything to drink, Mr. Morita.

196
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,490
I'll go get you some.

197
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,890
Thank you very much.

198
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,190
Will you excuse me while I go fix my make-up?

199
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,590
Don't drink too much, Dad.

200
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,790
I know, I know.

201
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,490
You know what...

202
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,190
Don't you have to guard Misaki?

203
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,690
That's right, Dad. You've got work to do.

204
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,190
I couldn't possibly go into a room where a is fixing make-up.

205
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,690
Ran, you go.

206
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,890
I guess so.

207
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,590
It's a black out.

208
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,890
A thunder bolt probably fell somewhere.

209
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,290
This is bad.

210
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,690
Upstairs?

211
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,890
Darn!

212
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,570
Help!

213
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,270
The door is locked!

214
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,470
Out of the way!

215
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,570
Help!

216
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,870
Hold it!

217
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,970
Misaki!

218
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,970
Darn. Where the heck is he?

219
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,070
Darn... where'd it go?

220
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,570
Misaki.

221
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,570
What's the matter? Are you all right?

222
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,570
Somebody lowered the breakers.

223
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,670
Misaki!

224
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,970
What's the matter?

225
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,370
Somebody, suddenly...

226
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,270
What's that?

227
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,370
No!

228
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,570
Roberia.

229
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,070
Just as I thought, this is...

230
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,470
Ran, flowers by that name come out in that song too, don't they?

231
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,770
That song? You mean, "Nocturne of Red Love".

232
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,470
A rose, marigold, and roberia.

233
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,670
Which means that all the flowers

234
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,970
-that the person had sent up to now are... -"I am always watching you."

235
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,270
"Hearing your voice delights me."

236
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,370
Are you saying that someone is threatening Misaki

237
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,470
according to the lyrics of Gerald Tenma?

238
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,770
Threatening?

239
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,270
It means that someone is stalking your beautiful wife.

240
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,670
Although I know we are all in the midst of a party,

241
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,170
I'd like to question all of you.

242
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,570
Are you the one who lifted the breaker?

243
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,070
Yes. On my way here,

244
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,270
the breaker at the top of the stairs.

245
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,370
Where were you at that time, Hideki?

246
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,570
Mr. Morita, who are you?

247
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,070
Excuse me, I am not Morita, but Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

248
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,370
Kogoro Mouri?

249
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,270
You mean that famous detective?

250
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,070
Yes, that's right.

251
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,370
Misaki, you locked the door, didn't you?

252
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,170
Yes, just as I was about to fix my make-up,

253
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,670
the lights went out and I was attacked from behind.

254
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,870
You didn't see what the attacker looked like?

255
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,870
No...

256
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,870
I saw.

257
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,070
I couldn't see very clearly but...

258
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,470
He was wearing a cape and had a blank facial expression.

259
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,970
He looked like a foreigner.

260
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,670
Like a foreigner?

261
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,270
Me? Why me?

262
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,970
Pardon me, where were you at that time?

263
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,970
I went to the front door to meet Gerald.

264
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,770
The lights went out and I came inside because it began to rain.

265
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,970
I saw Hideki, and heard a voice scream, "Help!"

266
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,170
We came here together.

267
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,970
Will you cut it out.

268
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,870
Michelle is an important guest.

269
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,570
Gerald!

270
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,170
He looks like the attacker.

271
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,870
Let me introduce you,

272
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,370
this is our main guest tonight, Mr. Gerald Tenma.

273
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,770
"Gerald Tenma (34)" -There seemed to be no one downstairs so I...

274
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,270
We had a black out here.

275
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,970
May I speak to you downstairs?

276
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,670
Please come with me too, everyone.

277
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,770
The door of the room was locked.

278
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,970
Which means that the attacker was already in the room.

279
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,970
Everyone who left the large reception room beforehand had a chance...

280
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,770
Which means that someone lowered the breaker.

281
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,070
Could there be more than one attacker?

282
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,670
What is this a piece of?

283
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,670
The crack is still new...

284
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,070
There are other small debris around.

285
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,470
Here?

286
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,570
No, the size is different.

287
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,970
What is this a trace of?

288
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,970
Where were you all when the incident occurred?

289
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,070
I was in the restroom.

290
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,470
I panicked when the lights went out.

291
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,170
I was in the kitchen checking on the cake Misaki had baked.

292
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,070
Mr. Tenma, you were drenched, weren't you?

293
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,470
That's because I got off the taxi by the gate.

294
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,870
Is that true?

295
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,270
Well, why don't we take a break then?

296
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,970
Excuse me.

297
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,170
Oh no, where's Conan?

298
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,970
Don't tell me he's at it again.

299
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,370
Are you all right?

300
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,670
Can you go and get medicine from my room?

301
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,470
Yeah, okay.

302
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,270
The picture that was taken last night was...

303
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,870
They seemed to have struggled pretty hard...

304
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,970
Misaki and Gerald Tenma?

305
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,270
This is dated 10 years ago.

306
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,370
It's 6 months before Misaki got married.

307
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,270
Hey!

308
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,970
Conan, you're going to be scolded by Dad again.

309
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,570
-What's that? -Well, this is, you see...

310
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,170
-Show it to me. -Oh, no!

311
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,670
No, you can't.

312
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,370
What's the matter?

313
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,170
Oh no!

314
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,370
What is the meaning of this?

315
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,770
Did you have intimate relationships with Misaki in the past?

316
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,970
What shall I do?

317
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,970
Yoshinori, what a rude thing to say!

318
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,070
Hideki!

319
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,570
Don't tell me that you knew and yet deliberately...

320
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,970
Why would I do such a thing?

321
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,970
Stop it.

322
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,470
-Misaki. -Dear...

323
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,670
It's true, that before I married you, I was going with him.

324
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,070
His real name is Junya Tenma, and I used to go with him.

325
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,870
He was a nameless artist back then.

326
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,870
But, on a certain day, 20 years ago,

327
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,070
your whereabouts suddenly became unknown.

328
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,270
Isn't that right?

329
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,870
When I saw the papers of Gerald Tenma

330
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,570
that we were going to sign a contract with,

331
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,270
I was surprised to find that such a coincidence existed.

332
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,570
It's been a long time, Mr. Tenma.

333
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,270
Yeah.

334
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,470
Mrs. Kana, I have a gift for you.

335
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,570
It's hand made wine, something that you cannot get in Japan.

336
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,370
I would like to taste the wine.

337
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,570
There seems to be nothing wrong with it.

338
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,270
Let's have juice.

339
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,270
Now, let's all have a toast.

340
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,270
-Cheers! -Cheers!

341
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,270
She's still on her guard after all.

342
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,970
Yes, this sure is good wine!

343
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,870
Excuse me.

344
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,570
No problem.

345
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,470
Oh yes. I was baking a cake.

346
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,670
Masayo, will you go to the basement in the yard

347
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,270
and get me the silver tea set?

348
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,270
Yes.

349
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,670
I will serve you all a special hand-made cake I made.

350
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,370
Please wait a moment.

351
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,770
As one of the conditions of publishing the "Nocturne of Red Love"

352
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,270
from your company,

353
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,270
have slightly changed the lyrics and made new arrangements.

354
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,070
One with a new arrangement?

355
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,470
Gerald insisted on doing so.

356
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,470
I found this bunch of flowers at the entrance.

357
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,970
Dahlias.

358
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,270
Dahlias stand for betrayal.

359
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,870
Betrayal?

360
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,670
Thank you for waiting.

361
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,870
Listen, everyone.

362
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,770
Mr. Tenma, won't you play your music for us?

363
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,270
After all, you're here in person.

364
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,070
Very well.

365
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,270
You attacked Misaki, didn't you?

366
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,670
Not that again.

367
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,070
Who else but you could've done it?

368
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,770
I have to make preparations, so please leave me alone.

369
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,170
Don't tell me you're thinking of fleeing?

370
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,470
Will you cut it out?

371
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,070
They seem to be having an argument.

372
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,570
Let's go check on them.

373
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,370
It's Mr. Tenma's voice!

374
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,570
What's wrong?

375
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,370
No, I didn't do it.

376
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,370
Gerald?

377
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,970
Gerald!

378
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,570
This is?

379
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,120
"Wine"

381
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,480
Next episode is solving the case.

382
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,560
What was that?

383
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,680
The sound of solving the case.

384
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,780
Really?
