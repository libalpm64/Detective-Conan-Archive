1
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:05,929
I'm so excited!

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,229
To think that we get to eat the chocolate of Yukihiko Tsujimoto

3
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:11,529
that won the silver award at a world contest!

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,229
Ms. Mayuko Sakura who produced the shop

5
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,129
is young and beautiful, isn't she?

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,829
They say that Mr. Tsujimoto

7
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:22,429
couldn't have succeeded without her, you know.

8
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,929
And, they're getting married too.

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:27,529
They sure are meant for each other.

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,429
A world renown chocolatier and...

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,929
A beautiful shop producer join to create...

12
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,829
A love-romance chocolate.

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,629
If you eat it with the one you love,

14
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,329
that love will be realized.

15
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,629
How wonderful.

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,629
All out girl-talk.

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,229
I would've loved to eat it with Makoto.

18
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,929
Who cares, anything delicious makes you happy

19
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:49,029
no matter who you eat it with.

20
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,929
Come on, I'll bet you want to eat it

21
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,529
with Shinichi too, don't you?

22
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,229
No, it's not that.

23
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,129
The fact is you're going to be eating it with me.

24
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,729
If all cases were men,

25
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,629
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

26
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,129
Enveloped in flames of love.

27
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,929
Chocolate ignites the fuse of the case.

28
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:27,529
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,429
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,929
His name is Detective Conan.

31
00:02:56,682 --> 00:03:01,982
"Hot Chocolate Trap"

32
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:09,682
Hi, Mayuko, long time no see.

33
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:11,882
Thank you for inviting us.

34
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:14,282
Welcome to Le Tresor de Fruits,

35
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,882
we've been waiting for you.

36
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:18,782
What a nice shop!

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,982
Thanks to the all out support of the Suzuki Financial Company,

38
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:26,282
"Sakura Mayuko (25)" -I was able to get together top class items.

39
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,782
We're opening tomorrow,

40
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:30,182
so you're our very first customers, Sonoko.

41
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:34,082
Are we able to eat Mr. Tsujimoto's chocolate at the shop too?

42
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:38,382
Our concept is to serve freshly made chocolate.

43
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:41,882
Um, are those bottles liquor?

44
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:45,782
That's called Nahureka.

45
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,982
It's liqueur made by soaking fruit into strong liquor.

46
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,182
They all look so pretty and delicious.

47
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:57,582
Really! So much so, that I want to leave them untouched.

48
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:58,782
All the chocolate in our shop

49
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:01,982
is made to resemble the shape of a jewel.

50
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:06,082
The name of this shop means "Treasure Fruits" in French.

51
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,382
What is this one with the fruit on it?

52
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,382
The fruit part of the liqueur that on the shelf

53
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,482
was made into chocolate.

54
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,482
Well, would you like to taste it?

55
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:17,082
But I can't take liquor.

56
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,182
No need to worry.

57
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,582
Because all the alcohol has evaporated.

58
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,682
Then, let's take a bite of adult taste.

59
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:26,682
It's delicious.

60
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,282
Ran, maybe the love of your dream will come true.

61
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,482
Okay then, I'll try one too.

62
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,382
Delicious.

63
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:42,982
"Tsujimoto Yukihiko (41)" -Welcome to our atelier Le Tresor de Fruits!

64
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,982
He's the chocolatier, Yukihiko Tsujimoto.

65
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,882
Congratulations to your winning the Golden Award!

66
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:50,882
It's an honor to see you.

67
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:54,682
Merci, same here.

68
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:59,082
It's perfectly delightful to be told so by such lovely girls like you.

69
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,482
What a fake.

70
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,082
Let me introduce you.

71
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:05,882
She's Ms. Mouri.

72
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,282
How do you do?

73
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:09,282
And she's Ms. Suzuki,

74
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:11,682
daughter of the Suzuki Financial Company.

75
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,282
How do you do?

76
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:15,782
Enchante Madmoiselle.

77
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,482
Just as expected, you're a noble and refined lady.

78
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:21,582
Come, this way.

79
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,382
I've got to make preparations, so if you'll excuse me.

80
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:27,982
Please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

81
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:32,282
Okay, we'll start preparations.

82
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,382
Because we would like you to taste the masterpiece

83
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:35,582
that won us the Golden Award that will be

84
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,782
publicized tomorrow to the media at the grand opening of the shop.

85
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:39,982
All right,

86
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,182
maybe you'll also be announcing your wedding.

87
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:45,882
That's a secret.

88
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:48,382
Come on, how lucky.

89
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,982
A rich girl.

90
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:54,882
She's just a high school brat.

91
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:59,482
Well, if I can get that girl to like me,

92
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:02,882
it should be easy to get the tycoon to dish out money.

93
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:08,282
Hey, Sonoko, just what do you think you're doing.

94
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,582
The last picture of me being single.

95
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:12,882
I mean, Mr. Tsujimoto's so attractive.

96
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:16,382
Oh? He's not quite what I imagined him to be.

97
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:19,282
I think Mayuko's way better.

98
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:21,682
So, let's get started.

99
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:29,682
We'd like to commence

100
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:34,582
the opening ceremony of Le Tresor de Fruits.

101
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:38,982
And here's chocolatier, Mr. Yukihiko Tsujimoto

102
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,882
who won the honorable Golden Award in the world contest.

103
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:48,582
How beautiful.

104
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:51,582
This is the chocolate named "dans le space" (To space),

105
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:54,682
shown for the first time in Japan.

106
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,982
The ingredients used are cacao made of premium grade

107
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:01,982
Criollo seeds and cocoa powder butter.

108
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:04,382
Liqueur that is made of fruit that is carefully selected

109
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,782
bring out the utmost flavor of the chocolate.

110
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:09,882
It looks like a sculpture.

111
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,082
Really, how wonderful!

112
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:15,882
But, the show is just starting.

113
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,682
Let me take you on a journey beyond your dreams,

114
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,982
to the distant Milky Way.

115
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,782
Is it the flame of love?

116
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,482
This is...

117
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,682
-Run for it! -Sonoko?

118
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:52,282
Ran, call the fire station!

119
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:53,882
You run for it too, Conan!

120
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:55,082
Yukihiko!

121
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,882
Everybody, run outside!

122
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:01,282
Conan!

123
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,682
Conan.

124
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:21,982
And, did you figure out what caused the fire?

125
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,882
We're still checking

126
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,782
but it seems that the fire

127
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,282
was ignited by the liqueur inside the bottles that fell off this shelf

128
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,882
that had a high concentrate of alcohol and spread.

129
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,182
Inspector Yuminaga.

130
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,682
She is the joint manager, Ms. Mayuko Sakura.

131
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,382
Could you explain how the fire started?

132
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:40,582
The chocolate fruit liqueur suddenly caught fire.

133
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,882
Mr. Tsujimoto who was surprised

134
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:44,182
bumped into the shelf and the bottles fell.

135
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,582
Then... Tsujimoto...

136
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,982
The contents seem liqueur

137
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:52,982
made by soaking a fruit called Nahureka in spirytus.

138
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:57,782
Spirytus? You mean vodka with an alcohol concentrate of 96%?

139
00:08:57,782 --> 00:09:00,182
Inspector, we've found that the clothes

140
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:01,982
that Mr. Tsujimoto was wearing

141
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:04,282
was made of extremely flammable pile fabric velvet.

142
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:07,382
It's my fault.

143
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:11,482
I'm the one who chose the fabric for his new cook's coat.

144
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:14,582
I had no idea that something like this would happen.

145
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:17,982
Mayuko, let's go over there and rest a while, okay?

146
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:20,982
You don't mind, do you? Inspector Yuminaga.

147
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,482
No.

148
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:26,582
Inspector, is it possible that the fire was ignited by static?

149
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:30,182
The alcohol of the liqueur that vaporized

150
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:32,382
ignited from static of the outfit.

151
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:35,682
Mr. Tsujimoto who was surprised bumped into the shelf,

152
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:39,682
then the bottles fell and the alcohol spread over the floor,

153
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,982
causing an outburst of fire.

154
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:45,982
Furthermore, the fire spread over to Mr. Tsujimoto

155
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,682
who was wearing a flammable outfit?

156
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:52,782
Mr. Inspector, don't you think that it's too early to conclude that

157
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:54,482
it was an accident caused by static electricity,

158
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,482
just because you can't find anything else?

159
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,782
Keep your nose out of the investigation, brat!

160
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:00,782
Hey, brat!

161
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,682
Wrong. Back then,

162
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,082
the fire broke out as soon as it touched the liqueur,

163
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,582
and a huge blaze went up immediately.

164
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,582
The shells of pistachio nuts?

165
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,582
Why would something like this be here?

166
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:16,282
Over here too.

167
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,082
Maybe the shells were placed under the bottles of Nahureka

168
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:23,182
so that they would crack easily.

169
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:26,082
Brat, don't make me repeat myself.

170
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,482
The crime site's not a park, you know.

171
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,782
Mayuko, does it hurt?

172
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,782
What seems to be the matter?

173
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:37,482
When the fire spread, it burned Mayuko's sleeve too.

174
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:39,782
I'm just fine.

175
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,182
I put the fire out right away by myself, you see.

176
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:46,182
Uh, why did Mayuko's clothes burn too?

177
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:48,582
We're all virtually not burned.

178
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,482
True. Just to be sure,

179
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,882
will you please explain what happened back then?

180
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,482
When the fire spread

181
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:57,782
and I was about to flee together with Sonoko

182
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,882
and the others, my sleeve suddenly caught fire.

183
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,382
Sparks of fire probably came flying.

184
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:06,882
Which means that Ms. Sakura, you were not near Mr. Tsujimoto?

185
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:07,882
No.

186
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:10,382
I'm sure that after giving the silver pot

187
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:13,082
to Mr. Tsujimoto, she came over to where Sonoko was.

188
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:15,682
It's true that back then,

189
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:18,582
Mayuko was near Sonoko right through.

190
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:22,082
Come to think of it, after Mr. Tsujimoto poured

191
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,582
the water into the container of chocolate,

192
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,582
his facial expression looked strange.

193
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:30,182
It looked as if something he didn't expect had happened.

194
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:34,182
Inspector, this was found near the corpse.

195
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:35,882
What's this?

196
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:38,482
It's the burnt remains of steel wool.

197
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:40,082
Steel wool?

198
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,882
Why would something like this be here?

199
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:46,382
A pot scrubber was made of steel wool was found in the kitchen.

200
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:49,882
Sir, what's this?

201
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:52,482
-What is it, sonny? -What is it now?

202
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:55,582
It looks to be a non-woven fabric.

203
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,482
This is material that is used to make packaging materials.

204
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:02,282
It's usually used as bags for deodorants.

205
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:04,282
You sure know a lot, don't you, sonny?

206
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:06,382
Don't you think it's strange, though?

207
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:09,782
Why would something like deodorant be here?

208
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:13,282
Deodorant was also found inside the refrigerator in the kitchen.

209
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,282
It's probably the same thing.

210
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:16,482
Nothing's strange about something

211
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,782
that was in the kitchen being here, is there?

212
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,882
So, out you go!

213
00:12:20,882 --> 00:12:22,882
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:27,082
No, wrong. If that was a deodorant bag.

215
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,882
There's something crystallized in the pot. Is it salt?

216
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:39,182
I get it. Salt, deodorant, steel wool...

217
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:43,282
Just one more, if that piece is found.

218
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,882
Inspector.

219
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:48,082
It would be safe to say that the fire was caused by static electricity.

220
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:51,582
We found that Mr. Tsujimoto's scarf was made of nylon fabric.

221
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:53,182
I see.

222
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,182
Nylon material when combined with cotton fabric

223
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,482
such as velvet

224
00:12:57,482 --> 00:13:00,882
is prone to cause static electricity.

225
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,382
So, it's been concluded that this was an accident

226
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,982
caused by static electricity.

227
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:06,682
I still think it's better that you go to the doctor to be examined.

228
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:08,682
I'm fine, no big deal.

229
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:10,782
-But... -Hey, Inspector,

230
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,082
just how long do you intend to keep people who are hurt go untreated?

231
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:15,382
Yeah... I guess we now have an idea

232
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,582
of the cause of the fire, so I think it's okay to let you go.

233
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,282
No good. If things are left as is,

234
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,982
this case will be closed as a simple accident.

235
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:24,482
Let's go, Mayuko.

236
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:29,082
If my deduction is correct, I'm sure it's still here.

237
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:32,382
Oh no! Ants are by the chocolate

238
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:33,682
that is evidence of the case.

239
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,882
Really?

240
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,182
Huh? There aren't any.

241
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:42,882
Strange. I'm sure I saw a black one moving.

242
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,582
Don't you think that you should take the evidence

243
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:47,682
and store it before ants get to it?

244
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,982
Maybe so...

245
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:57,082
No doubt about it, this is not an accident.

246
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,582
It's a carefully schemed homicide.

247
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,084
Come, Mayuko.

248
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,284
Okay.

249
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,784
Come to think of it, where did that glasses brat go?

250
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,684
Wait a sec!

251
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,184
Sonoko?

252
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:25,184
I've figured out

253
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,884
the trick that killed Mr. Tsujimoto.

254
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:30,384
Hey, sis, this is an accident.

255
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:31,784
There's no mistake to conclude that

256
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:34,184
static electricity caused the fire.

257
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,184
Inspector, how gullible, too sweet.

258
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:37,184
Too sweet?

259
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:40,084
Sweeter than chocolate with a lot of milk in it!

260
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:44,084
Okay, then tell me of that trick you have in mind.

261
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,084
That's more like it.

262
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,784
First, I'll start with what the real cause of the fire was.

263
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,784
I'll explain the trick of how the fire started.

264
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:55,184
Of all the evidence that was found on site,

265
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:57,384
there are three things that served as the key.

266
00:14:57,384 --> 00:15:01,984
The deodorant, the salt crystal and foil.

267
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,984
The salt crystal and foil? Just what're you getting at?

268
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,984
The salt crystal was inside the silver pot.

269
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:10,084
As for the aluminium foil

270
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,684
you took it a while ago.

271
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:14,984
Together with the melted chocolate.

272
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,584
Oh, here it is.

273
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,784
True.

274
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,784
I'll entertain you a bit now, then.

275
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,984
Conan, will you get that for me!

276
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:27,384
Okay. Since Sonoko told me to, I made this.

277
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:30,584
Ran, will you please pour water in the teapot

278
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,984
into all the aluminium cups except for the one at the very top?

279
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:35,084
Okay.

280
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:40,484
Oh, that's enough.

281
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,384
What?

282
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:54,984
This is a remake of the ignition device

283
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:57,584
that was used in the incident.

284
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:00,784
What on earth is going on?

285
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:03,284
There is steel wool underneath the folded crane.

286
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:06,984
It's bright red... Is that how the crane burned?

287
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:11,484
There's activated carbon in the cup below.

288
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:14,584
And, the water in the pot is salt water.

289
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:17,684
I see, an air cell.

290
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:20,184
It's a phenomenon in which a chemical reaction occurs

291
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,884
when aluminum is mixed with salt water to produce electricity.

292
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:26,084
The same resources necessary to make the air cell

293
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,284
has been found at the site, you know!

294
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,584
Now, we know what generated the electricity,

295
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,984
but what caused the fire?

296
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:37,884
Inspector, when electricity goes through steel wool it ignites, you know.

297
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:41,584
In other words, the cause of the fire wasn't static electricity,

298
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,084
but rather, an ignition device that was made by using all these resources.

299
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,684
Ms. Mayuko, what was supposed to happen

300
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,384
to the swan chocolate after water

301
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,384
was poured inside it to begin with?

302
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:53,784
Well...

303
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:55,884
Back then, Mr. Tsujimoto said,

304
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:59,484
"Let me take you on a journey to the distant Milky Way."

305
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,184
If I'm not mistaken, to start with,

306
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,984
there was dry ice inside it.

307
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:06,484
When the water was poured in, white fog

308
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,384
was supposed to drift out causing an illusionary Milky Way performance.

309
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:11,984
But the culprit, in place of the dry ice

310
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:15,184
set up an ignition device using air cells.

311
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,184
However, Mr. Tsujimoto totally unaware

312
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:19,184
of this poured the salt water in himself.

313
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:21,584
The electricity passed through the steel wool and caught fire,

314
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,784
then the fire spread to the fruit liqueur making things worst.

315
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,584
But if Mr. Tsujimoto, wasn't so surprised by the fire,

316
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:29,484
and bump into the shelf, that made the bottles fall,

317
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:32,784
the fire wouldn't have spread as much as it did.

318
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,684
The bottle was rigged to begin with pistachio nuts

319
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:38,984
placed under it so that it would crack easily.

320
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:42,584
It's true that pistachio nut shells were found on the shelf.

321
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,684
What?

322
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:46,684
But that's not all the trap that the culprit set up.

323
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:48,984
Something else was set up from the very beginning.

324
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,384
What?

325
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:53,384
Ran, try hard and remember.

326
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:56,784
Back then, was Mr. Tsujimoto that surprised

327
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,684
just because the fruit liqueur caught fire?

328
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:02,084
Hold it... The fruit liqueur caught fire

329
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:05,284
and Mr. Tsujimoto bumped into the shelf.

330
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,884
That's right. But before that a big blaze went up for an instant.

331
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:11,184
What? Are you sure about that?

332
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:15,684
Yes. After that the bottle fell causing a large blaze.

333
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,384
Therefore, I think my memory was a bit mixed up.

334
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:20,184
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,884
Oh, well, at a scene where something like that happened,

336
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,484
it can't be helped.

337
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:28,184
But, how was that large blazed caused?

338
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:30,384
The culprit placed a paper container

339
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,184
with spyritus inside it under the table.

340
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:36,284
That way, alcohol can be made to vaporize in the space

341
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:39,684
that is covered by the tablecloth and spread throughout.

342
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:42,884
And just before the show if the tablecloth

343
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:45,384
is flipped up to release the vaporized alcohol.

344
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,384
It'll ignite to the fire of the fruit liqueur which caused the outbreak.

345
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:53,384
Ms. Mayuko, you were fixing the tablecloth

346
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,384
before the show began, weren't you?

347
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,884
Right.

348
00:18:56,884 --> 00:19:00,684
Ms. Mayuko Sakura, the culprit is you!

349
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:05,584
Oh no... Ms. Mayuko is?

350
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,184
Ms. Sonoko, please cut out your jokes.

351
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,984
I got burnt like this too, didn't I?

352
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,184
No,

353
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,484
that's indeed evidence of you being the culprit.

354
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:21,184
Your sleeve got burnt when you set the liqueur under the table,

355
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:23,884
because your sleeve was smeared with alcohol.

356
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:27,884
I see. That's why only the sleeve of her outfit caught fire.

357
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:30,584
That's just an assumption!

358
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:35,184
Ms. Sakura, will you please explain what's going on?

359
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:38,484
Don't tell me that even you the police suspect me?

360
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:40,584
Besides, that ignition device or what

361
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:43,184
that you're talking about was made of items found in the kitchen!

362
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:45,284
So, it's natural you would find it at the scene of the crime, isn't it?

363
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,084
Of course it's natural, because that's exactly

364
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:52,184
what you were going for when you made that crafty device.

365
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,284
This shop is scheduled to open tomorrow!

366
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:57,084
Many people went in out including delivery people,

367
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,284
and facility management personnel!

368
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:02,484
I'm sure that anyone of them would've been able to commit the crime, no?

369
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:05,584
No, only you could've done it!

370
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:06,684
Huh?

371
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:08,484
Ran, can you get me my cell phone

372
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:09,884
that is inside my pochette.

373
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,684
-Okay. -Please show Mayuko the picture

374
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,884
I took with my cell phone a while ago.

375
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:18,884
The picture. Oh, this.

376
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:23,584
Just before the show started,

377
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:26,484
Mr. Tsujimoto drank the water from the pot.

378
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:30,684
If the water was salt water, he would've naturally noticed.

379
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:35,684
You're the only person who could've added salt to the pot after that!

380
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:45,184
I was nothing more than a tool to him.

381
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:46,684
The time has finally come

382
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:49,184
for our dream to come true.

383
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:53,184
Yeah, I'm standing at the pinnacle as a chocolatier of Japan,

384
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:56,184
who has a shop in the first class district of Tokyo.

385
00:20:56,184 --> 00:21:00,384
I think it's about time that you think about our wedding too.

386
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,384
Wedding?

387
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:06,784
Don't tell me you're being manipulated by the media too?

388
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:10,984
I'm really grateful for all you did.

389
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:15,184
You dished out a lot of ideas so that I could achieve success.

390
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:18,484
You're a top-notch drawer.

391
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,384
A drawer?

392
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,984
But, my dream's been realized.

393
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:26,384
The best position, the best shop.

394
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:28,584
I've gotten hold of everything.

395
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:32,684
I don't need any old drawers anymore.

396
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:35,184
Oh no.

397
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:38,484
You're to be disposed of along with the opening of the shop.

398
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:41,584
Thank you for everything till now.

399
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:48,284
I loved him.

400
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:51,984
I gave him my all and did everything I could do.

401
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:54,284
And yet, he had the nerve to dispose of me

402
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:58,084
as if disposing of something that he found no use for anymore.

403
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,784
Ms. Mayuko.

404
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:03,084
If I was going to lose him anyway, I wanted to burn everything off.

405
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:06,184
Him as well as the shop.

406
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:10,084
My love too!

407
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:42,084
Just as I thought, in the hands of "Deduction Queen Sonoko",

408
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:45,084
all cases are solved in a jiffy.

409
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,084
The chocolate of the crystallization of love that

410
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:52,284
I was going to eat with Makoto melted in a jiffy.

411
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:56,484
Solving cases in too much of a jiffy is not good.

412
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:59,584
All you did was sleep.

413
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,300
"Air bag"

415
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,360
The next episode involves the love story of the "you know who" police detective.

416
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,700
Ran, how've you been doing with Shinichi since?

417
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:09,760
Nothing really.
Ran, how've you been doing with Shinichi since?

418
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:56,080
Nothing really.
