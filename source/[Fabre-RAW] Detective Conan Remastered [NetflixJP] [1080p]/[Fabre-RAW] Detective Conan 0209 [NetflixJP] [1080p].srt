1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,240
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,040
Today we take a slow drive along a mountain path.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,040
At the bottom of the valley is the smell of murder.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,940
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,390
"Mt. Ryujin in West Tama County"

9
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,390
"Tsuzura Ori Pass"

10
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,690
Some hill this is!

11
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,190
We've come so far up.

12
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,390
We've still got a long way to go.

13
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,990
We've only come about halfway.

14
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,990
Oh, no. You've gotta be kidding.

15
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,690
What's up?

16
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,290
Oh, man.

17
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,990
With all that right and left swinging,

18
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,990
my head's spinning.

19
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,990
Come on, what a sissy.

20
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,090
This place called Tsuzura Ori Pass,

21
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,090
has a succession of 99 curves, big and small in all.

22
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,190
I feel nauseated just listening to you.

23
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,090
Where is Mitsuhiko?

24
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,590
Mitsuhiko's reading a book in the car.

25
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,490
What?

26
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,190
Mitsuhiko!

27
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,890
It feels just great out here!

28
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,490
No, thanks. I'm reading the best part now!

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,890
Dr. Agasa, Ai didn't come along again.

30
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,390
Ai was saying she had something to do.

31
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,490
Dr. Agasa, I'll bet you that...

32
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,890
This was what happened,

33
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,490
"I'm not interested in camps."

34
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,990
You're really good, Genta. It's just like her.

35
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,390
Bull's eye.

36
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,490
What's that?

37
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,890
Oh, no!

38
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,790
Dr. Agasa! Get the police and an ambulance!

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,990
Okay!

40
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,390
"Great Fall From Mt. Ryujin"

41
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,090
You said you were resting at the scenic spot there

42
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,490
when you witnessed the car go over the cliff,

43
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,590
-so you came running over, right? -Yes.

44
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,290
That dent?

45
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,690
If so...

46
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,890
I'd like to ask you once again...

47
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,490
Did you notice something else suspicious, like a car or a person?

48
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,290
No, nothing at all.

49
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,390
I see.

50
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,590
That's it.

51
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,390
Officer.

52
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,890
What is it, sonny?

53
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,490
May I go and take a look at what the men are doing above?

54
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,190
No, no. It's not something for a child to watch!

55
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,190
I think they're almost finished up there anyway.

56
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,590
It should be okay.

57
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,390
But...

58
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,590
But, sonny,

59
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,790
make sure you don't get in the way of their work when you watch them.

60
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,090
Yes, sir!

61
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,390
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

62
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,590
don't we have to go, too?

63
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,990
Conan's going to go off on his own like always, you know?

64
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,890
Who cares?

65
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,790
Let him do what he pleases.

66
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,290
We've got something better here.

67
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,490
Something better?

68
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,290
Okay, here!

69
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,790
Okay!

70
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,690
16.33 meters.

71
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,590
16.33...

72
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,190
There.

73
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,790
It's a piece of polish that rubbed off!

74
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,790
Really?

75
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,690
Look, it's dark blue!

76
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,090
Dark blue.

77
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,490
Which means...

78
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,890
Yeah!

79
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,490
So that's what happened.

80
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,690
We came all the way out here to have a picnic

81
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,490
and get messed up in an accident like this.

82
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,390
It's not an accident.

83
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,890
What do you mean it's not an accident?

84
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,090
Didn't the officer there ask you if you saw any other cars?

85
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,390
Yeah.

86
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,390
That car fell over because it was pushed from behind by another car.

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,390
What?

88
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,990
That car had a dent in the rear,

89
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,990
an indication of it having been hit from behind.

90
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,890
Besides, the paint that seemed to have rubbed off

91
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,490
from the other car was also found.

92
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,490
Moreover,

93
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,290
the car that hit from behind most likely did so deliberately.

94
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,190
Then it's homicide.

95
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,690
Yeah.

96
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,890
Don't we have to cooperate with the police?

97
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,390
It'll be fine, after all, they've got so much evidence.

98
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,990
But, all they've got is rubbed off paint and a dent in the rear.

99
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,490
The Japanese police are usually very efficient.

100
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,390
So long as a piece of rubbed off paint is found,

101
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,390
from the color and substance they can figure out the model of the car, too.

102
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,590
Then all they have to do is go asking around for details

103
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,390
to get to the one who did it.

104
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,090
I see.

105
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,090
Mitsuhiko,

106
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,490
what do you mean by something better?

107
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,890
Quiet. Conan will hear you.

108
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,790
This is it, Genta.

109
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,290
What is this?

110
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,690
It's a code.

111
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,690
A codes?

112
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,090
I picked it up near the site of the accident just a while ago.

113
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,390
Then, shouldn't you have told the police about it?

114
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,590
But, what we saw was just an accident, wasn't it?

115
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,090
It's hard to believe that a code has anything to do with it.

116
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,290
You're right.

117
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,090
Codes are usually used for figuring out

118
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,590
where treasures are hidden, aren't they?

119
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,490
Right, exactly.

120
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,790
Treasure.

121
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,490
So, take a good look at this!

122
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,190
See, on the very top in the square, the equation "100 minus 1" is written.

123
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,690
Okay, Genta, what is 100 minus 1?

124
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,190
Nine...

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,990
Ninety-nine?

126
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,690
Right.

127
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,090
Is there something that crosses your mind

128
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,290
when you think of the number 99?

129
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,090
99...

130
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,190
Nine...

131
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,390
911, ambulance.

132
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,090
Nope.

133
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,690
Whatever gave you the idea of 911 at this point?

134
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,690
First aid bandage then?

135
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,490
I got it!

136
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,390
It's the Tsuzura Ori Pass, right?

137
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,590
Dr. Agasa just explained

138
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,890
that there is a succession of 99 hairpin curves, didn't he?

139
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,790
Correct.

140
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,390
Which means that this code indicates

141
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,390
a place somewhere in the Tsuzura Ori Pass area.

142
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,090
And, did you figure out where it is, Mitsuhiko?

143
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,690
No, but this code sure looks familiar.

144
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,890
Where did you see it, Mitsuhiko?

145
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,290
Hey, you guys!

146
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,090
What's with all the racket?

147
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,490
It's nothing!

148
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,290
Right, right. We're not talking about any codes.

149
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,390
Codes?

150
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,490
Oh, well, the novel that I was reading you see...

151
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,890
Some codes came out...

152
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,690
They're too easy for you, Conan, so...

153
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,590
Gosh, so it's children's stuff.

154
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,190
I've got it.

155
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,190
Okay then, you guys,

156
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,590
Dr. Agasa and I are going fishing,

157
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,190
don't forget to chop the firewood.

158
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,990
Okay...

159
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,290
Bye.

160
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,690
Here goes!

161
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,590
Mitsuhiko, did you really figure it out?

162
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,890
It was in the book that I was reading!

163
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,290
Really?

164
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,390
This!

165
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,090
What is this?

166
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,190
The keyboard of a computer?

167
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,590
Yes.

168
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,090
Numbers are written in numerical order from the top left,

169
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,090
and they correspond to the same hiragana keys!

170
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,390
For instance, 1 and 4 equal the hiragana "ta".

171
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,390
2 and 7 equals "to" and so forth.

172
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,390
All right!

173
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,490
Let's try it!

174
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,990
Genta, please read the number codes.

175
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,590
Okay!

176
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,890
0 and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 8.

177
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,790
0 and 4 ecuals "u".

178
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,590
2 and 3 equals "se".

179
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,290
3 and 8 equals "tsu".

180
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,290
A right turn?

181
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,890
What is this mark supposed to mean?

182
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,090
Maybe this is the shape of the road?

183
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,590
Right! You're probably right.

184
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,390
That's why the first code can be deciphered as

185
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,490
"Turn right at the intersection".

186
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,090
You're fantastic, Mitsuhiko.

187
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,090
Let's continue.

188
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,790
I'll write it down.

189
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,290
This is boring.

190
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,490
There, it's done!

191
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,990
Please read it.

192
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,590
I'll follow along on the map.

193
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,690
Okay!

194
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,090
Turn right at the intersection after passing Tsuzura Ori Pass.

195
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,190
Turn right at the forked road,

196
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,490
then turn left at the next fork.

197
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,690
Cross two bridges,

198
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,690
turn left after the 2nd bridge and goal.

199
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,990
Okay, it's over here.

200
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,490
The pension house is over here, so it's pretty close.

201
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,290
Let's go check it out.

202
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,090
Maybe we'll find the treasure.

203
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,590
I'm sure Conan will be vexed.

204
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,590
We're here.

205
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,390
Hey, are you guys upstairs?

206
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,290
We've had a big catch!

207
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,490
What is this?

208
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,590
Hey, bad news.

209
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,990
The kids are nowhere in sight!

210
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,190
What?

211
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,090
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

212
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,190
Are we not there yet?

213
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,790
We've only got a little more to go, so hang in there, Genta.

214
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,290
We're crossing the 2nd bridge now.

215
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,190
After we turn right at the next fork, we'll get there!

216
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,390
We've still got that much more to go.

217
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,390
Hang in there, Genta!

218
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,190
If we find the treasure, you'll get a luxurious serving of eels over rice!

219
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,190
Eels over rice.

220
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,990
Okay, if we find the treasure,

221
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,090
I'll eat all the eels over rice I can eat!

222
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,490
Let's go, Mitsuhiko, for 100,000 eels over rice.

223
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,390
All right, that's the spirit.

224
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,090
This is bad. Could this be...

225
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,690
Did you figure it out?

226
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,090
Dr. Agasa, call the police right away!

227
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,190
What?

228
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,390
They went to the hideout of the one

229
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,490
who pushed the car over just a while ago.

230
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,290
What?

231
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,790
So this was the code they were talking about in the car a while ago.

232
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,290
Darn!

233
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,280
We did it! We've finally come, Genta!

234
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,580
It's over there!

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,980
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

236
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,080
are you sure this is the right place?

237
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,880
It doesn't look to have anything to do with treasure, does it?

238
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,380
What a thing to say!

239
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,180
We came exactly as the code said, so it's got to be right!

240
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,380
Besides, it's places like this that treasures are usually hidden.

241
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,580
Okay, let's go inside then!

242
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,780
Yes, thank you.

243
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,280
The police will rush over to the site immediately.

244
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,380
Let's hurry on over, too.

245
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Okay.

246
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,380
It seems that nobody is in...

247
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Hey, Mitsuhiko, where's the treasure?

248
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
The building farthest beyond...

249
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,880
Look!

250
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,680
That building over there is capable of being locked.

251
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,980
-I'm sure it's there. -Yep.

252
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,880
Let's check it out!

253
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,980
This is...

254
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,880
Amazing!

255
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Look at all those foreign model cars!

256
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,480
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

257
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,380
there's no treasure anywhere, though.

258
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,480
Strange.

259
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,980
Hey, you two.

260
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,280
There's something funny about this car.

261
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
See.

262
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,980
It has no license plate.

263
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,380
You're right.

264
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,080
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

265
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,180
There's none on this one, too.

266
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,180
Maybe they're all stolen cars.

267
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm sure they're planning to sell it off to some foreign country.

268
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,280
We've come to the hideout of car smugglers!

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,180
Exactly!

270
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,580
You're the brats that were at the site of the accident...

271
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,680
Who cares!

272
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,080
Where's the guy with the mustache and the other kid?

273
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,480
Just who are you referring to?

274
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,380
Don't you play dumb with me!

275
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,080
What was that sound?

276
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,280
-The sound of gunfire! -What?

277
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,080
Hurry up will you, Dr. Agasa?

278
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,880
All right!

279
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,580
I'll ask you once more.

280
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,980
Where's the guy with 4 the mustache and the other kid?

281
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,280
I have no idea what you're talking about.

282
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,480
What?

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,280
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

284
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,080
Mitsuhiko.

285
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,080
No, I can't get Conan and Dr. Agasa involved in something

286
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,680
I got messed up in because of my actions.

287
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,880
He's right.

288
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
Yeah.

289
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,480
You must really want to die.

290
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,480
It's me.

291
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,380
Sorry, I've only got 5 for now.

292
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,280
Sada chickened out and rode off with one.

293
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,780
Yeah, I took care of that.

294
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,680
I hit him from behind at the ridge,

295
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,180
and he fell headfirst all the way down.

296
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,580
I'm no goof.

297
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,380
I'll scrap the car before the police get to it.

298
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,980
Once it's scrapped, there's no proof.

299
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
That's...

300
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,380
Hey, what's with you guys?

301
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,080
What's with you?

302
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,480
Swinging around a rifle at children!

303
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,780
Dr. Agasa.

304
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
You're the one who was at the scene of the accident.

305
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,080
There couldn't be better timing. You saved me time looking for you!

306
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
No use, mister.

307
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,880
See, you hear it, don't you?

308
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,780
That police car is headed here.

309
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,280
What?

310
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,580
They're coming here

311
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,280
to arrest you, mister!

312
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,680
What?

313
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,680
All right...

314
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,880
Hey, hey, officers...

315
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,880
I haven't done anything wrong.

316
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
Before we hear you out, give us that gun of yours.

317
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,880
Oh, you mean this gun?

318
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,980
I was only trying to scare the kids

319
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,180
because they trespassed on my property.

320
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,480
I see.

321
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
By the way, is that your car?

322
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Yeah, that's right. Anything wrong?

323
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,080
Well, a car happened to go over the cliff at Tsuzura Ori Pass

324
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,980
and it seems that a car of the same model as your

325
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,380
pushed that car over from behind.

326
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,480
Your car has a dent too and it looks like to have struck something.

327
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,880
What? Are you suspecting me?

328
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,680
There are several hundreds of cars like this, aren't there?

329
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,780
Just how many of those hundreds do you think

330
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,680
happened to be at the scene of the accident?

331
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,980
And where were you, May I ask, at that time?

332
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,480
Sorry, that was an accident.

333
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Since the scenery was so beautiful,

334
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,880
I took my eyes off the road.

335
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,180
And the next thing I knew, crash!

336
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,580
He's lying, officer!

337
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,680
Shut up, stay out of this, brat!

338
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,780
No, I'm not shutting up!

339
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,180
You just said on the phone

340
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,080
that you struck the car and pushed it over the cliff!

341
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,780
I heard you say so, too!

342
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,480
Me, too!

343
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,580
Hey, officer. Are you going to believe what those brats say?

344
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Just how do you think I can push a car over a cliff

345
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,980
by crashing from behind at a sharp bend like that?

346
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,380
You did exactly that!

347
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,880
You succeeded perfectly!

348
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,180
Old man! Quit your gibberish!

349
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,380
Do you have proof, or what? Proof!

350
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,980
Of course there's proof.

351
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,880
In the foreground of the curve where that car fell over,

352
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,580
there were two pairs of tire marks,

353
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,680
that were left behind when the car was hit from behind.

354
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,780
In other words, you collided twice.

355
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,480
So what?

356
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,080
I wasn't looking at the road and I collided twice.

357
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Well, there is a possibility too, however...

358
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,480
Do you know the space between the tires of the car that fell over?

359
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,980
Yes, 16.33 meters.

360
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,580
And, at what speed were you going at on that road?

361
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,180
Just about 30 kilometers!

362
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,580
Well, I guess so...

363
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,380
The fact that you were going at 30 kilometers means

364
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,780
you were going at about 8.3 meters per second.

365
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,480
In order to leave skid marks at a spacing of 16.33 meters.

366
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,680
It would take you approximately 2 seconds.

367
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,280
After colliding into the car in question, the first time,

368
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,580
for a period of 2 seconds,

369
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,680
you never steered to avoid another collision,

370
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,580
nor did you step on the brakes.

371
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,380
Rather, you collided again!

372
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,680
If this is not called colliding deliberately,

373
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
what else would you call it?

374
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,480
So, if you have anything more you want to say,

375
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,480
we'll hear you out at the station.

376
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,780
Darn!

377
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,480
Officer...

378
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,980
There are luxurious cars without license plates in the building beyond.

379
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,980
I'm sure those cars are all stolen cars.

380
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,380
Good work, all of you!

381
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,880
But, listen.

382
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,780
Don't ever do something dangerous like this again!

383
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,180
Yes, sir...

384
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,380
Darn. I just don't seem to have the knack for chopping firewood.

385
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,180
Darn, darn it!

386
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,280
Hey, we need more firewood!

387
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,980
Hey, Conan, why don t you help us a bit on this side, too?

388
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,680
No way!

389
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,080
It's your fault for loafing around without chopping firewood

390
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,880
like you should've been, serves you right.

391
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,280
Yes, yes, all right.

392
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,880
One "yes" is enough!

393
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,180
Yes!

394
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,180
I hope they learn their lesson and quit doing dangerous things.

395
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,580
How disappointing, though.

396
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,880
What is?

397
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,180
Conan deciphered that code in no time at all!

398
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,580
You were fantastic too, Mitsuhiko!

399
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,180
Not only did you figure out the code,

400
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,380
you also were right about the smugglers.

401
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,480
Oh, I just thought so because it was in the book I was reading.

402
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,580
Just great. Maybe I should look through it, too.

403
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,080
Oh, I've got just the thing for you, Genta!

404
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,880
"Children's Lunch Murder Case" is the title of it.

405
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,080
What a funny title!

406
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,180
I would rather have eels over nice than a children's lunch.

407
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,280
Hey, haven't you guys learned your lesson or what?

408
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,340
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,100
"Hanging Scroll"

410
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
The next episode is an original animation that is difficult to solve.

411
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,280
No matter how many times I watch it, I can't figure it out.
