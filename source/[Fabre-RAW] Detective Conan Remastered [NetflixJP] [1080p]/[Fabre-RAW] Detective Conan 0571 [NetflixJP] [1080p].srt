1
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:10,528
Hei, come on out already!

2
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:12,728
That's enough!

3
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:15,728
It's time to go home!

4
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,628
Where did he go?

5
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:44,428
Awesome!

6
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:05,028
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

7
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,128
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

8
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:09,428
Today's detective squad experiences something a bit different.

9
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,528
They have a treasure battle in a haunted storeroom.

10
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:13,228
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,128
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,228
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:03,916
"Treasure Battle in the Monster Storage Room (Part 1)"

14
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:09,216
Okay, then. Let's review the deeds

15
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:12,171
that we the detective squad has been performing recently.

16
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,316
First, it's the red, white and yellow case, right?

17
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:19,716
You mean that Kaito Sugiura's apartment arson case, right?

18
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,187
He said that when night comes,

19
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:31,116
there's a guy that does suspicious things!

20
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:34,193
As for Mr. Black and White,

21
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:37,816
I'll clear everything in black and white right here and now.

22
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:43,416
Who of everyone here is the yellow arsonist?

23
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:49,116
There was a red person and a white person written in Kaito's diary.

24
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:52,211
And the yellow person was the arsonist, right?

25
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:55,216
Conan was the black and white person, right?

26
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:58,616
Conan solved the mystery of red, white and yellow

27
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,216
and the culprit was arrested.

28
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,516
When Conan scores a point,

29
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:04,223
it's the same as we the detective squad scored the point too!

30
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:09,316
Of course, since Conan is also a member of the detective squad.

31
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,231
And the Ikkaku rock incident!

32
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,516
The message that the woman victim left behind,

33
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,916
"mackerel, carp, red sea bream, and flatfish".

34
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,243
The rock that is behind you,

35
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,016
there's something written on it.

36
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,116
"Mackerel, carp, red sea bream and flatfish".

37
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,616
Conan?

38
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:42,261
That message was solved and the culprit was arrested.

39
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,416
Conan did it.

40
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,616
We, the detective squad did.

41
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,516
Absolutely.

42
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:51,716
And the incident of the TV station that my father got messed up in.

43
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,016
I'll go take a look!

44
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,016
Conan!

45
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,916
You guys stay right there and don't move!

46
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,316
Cut out playing dumb already!

47
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:07,916
I heard with these very ears of mine

48
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,616
what you just spitted out, you see!

49
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,291
If you like,

50
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:15,116
I can shove my knuckles way down beyond your throat

51
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,816
and pull the Japanese paper out

52
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,299
along with the lunch you ate today, how about it?

53
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:24,300
Oh, no, I'll confess.

54
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,316
My dad really did his thing during that incident!

55
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:31,316
But, we didn't do anything at all back then, did we?

56
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:33,016
Conan left without us.

57
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:37,016
It's okay because dad and the detective squad did their thing.

58
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,317
I guess so.

59
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:41,616
Don't forget the Shirosaki Hot Spring case, too.

60
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:44,616
Right!

61
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:46,916
In order to search for the whereabouts of Ran who disappeared.

62
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,716
We, the detective squad, together with Heiji Hattori,

63
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,416
high school detective of the west, formed a formidable team.

64
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,116
Conan rode is skateboard

65
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,716
despite using crutches and started a great chase.

66
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,616
The crab bun, crab ice cream,

67
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,916
and crab stick were delicious.

68
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,116
There were the bank robbers, too!

69
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,316
And the incident that occurred

70
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,016
when we went to watch the Gomera movie.

71
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:12,116
We really did out thing then, didn't we?

72
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:15,816
-Thanks to Conan! -You mean the detective squad did it!

73
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:19,616
I went and told Ms. Kobayashi that we finished cleaning.

74
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,361
Okay, then, let's head home!

75
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,216
What? A robbery case?

76
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,916
Could it be the one that was aired on TV again today?

77
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:35,016
Yes, please take care and make sure to lock the door.

78
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,716
They're a band of thieves that are stealing jewellery

79
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:40,379
and antiques in this vicinity,

80
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,616
and they've already broke into five places this month already.

81
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:47,916
But, this is an elementary school, there's nothing to steal.

82
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,916
No... Nothing beats prevention.

83
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,416
Let me know right away if something comes up.

84
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,395
I'll fly right over.

85
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,216
Okay.

86
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,816
Inspector Shiratori is here again.

87
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,816
He was here yesterday too, right?

88
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:04,916
Yep, he is a workaholic.

89
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,816
Yes, because the police's job is to protect the citizens.

90
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,016
No, Inspector Shiratori's job

91
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,616
belongs with Investigations 1st division of vicious crimes.

92
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,415
He mainly takes care of murder cases.

93
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,616
Investigations 3rd division is in charge of thefts.

94
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:22,421
Well, a flashy theft

95
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,116
like the one committed by Thief Kid

96
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:28,416
who gives out warnings before committing the crime

97
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,016
would be investigated by the 2nd division though.

98
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,916
Then, why's he here?

99
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,816
He's not even in charge.

100
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,116
Oh, well, that's because...

101
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,216
It can't be helped, right?

102
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:42,816
To Inspector Shiratori, Ms. Kobayashi is...

103
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,816
Here, this is for you.

104
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,816
A token of my appreciation for helping me a while ago.

105
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,916
Cherry blossoms?

106
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,016
Cherry blossoms are the mark

107
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,116
that all the people of the police have on.

108
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:01,816
Strong, kind, cool and the flower of justice!

109
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,467
His destiny.

110
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,116
His destiny?

111
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,477
Hey, he told you not to say anything about it

112
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,716
because he wanted to tell her himself when the time was right.

113
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:24,116
Oh, really?

114
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,516
Love comedy guys

115
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:28,487
who can't express their real feelings

116
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,816
and cause confusion in women really annoy me.

117
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,716
You better not be referring to me.

118
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,216
Well, I think you they make a good couple, though.

119
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,816
She ignore me.

120
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:41,516
Ms. Kobayashi is a fan of Ranpo Edogawa and loves criminal cases.

121
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:45,916
Inspector Shiratori can probably tell her a lot the investigations.

122
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,016
Talking about cases,

123
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,316
Mitsuhiko was saying during lunch break, wasn't he?

124
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:52,511
Yeah.

125
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,916
Yes, right. Something about "hearty storeroom", was it?

126
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,016
Not hearty, but...

127
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,616
haunted storeroom.

128
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,016
Haunted storeroom?

129
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:08,527
Takuma in our class,

130
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,016
said that when he was playing hide-and-seek

131
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,531
at his relative's house in Beikacho 5 chome

132
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,216
with his friend,

133
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:18,316
He couldn't find his friend at all

134
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:21,616
and figured that the only place left to look for him was the storeroom.

135
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:23,016
So, he climbed a tree,

136
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:26,545
and peeked into the window of the storeroom.

137
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,616
He said he saw expensive looking artworks inside.

138
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,916
He says that he also saw someone

139
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,516
behind the treasure looking towards him.

140
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,316
Wasn't it the friend that he was playing hide-and-seek with?

141
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,716
Takuma thought so to and tried to go inside,

142
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:51,416
but the door was locked and he couldn't open the door.

143
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,116
Although he called his friend's name, his friend wouldn't come out.

144
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:57,916
So he went to ask the owner of the house to open the door.

145
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,516
But he was told that

146
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,216
the door of the storeroom hadn't been opened for years,

147
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:05,116
so nobody could've possibly made it inside.

148
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:09,316
And, so he gave up looking for his friend?

149
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:13,616
No. Takuma insisted that someone was inside,

150
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,416
and had the door opened.

151
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,216
When they went inside,

152
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:22,601
the person he saw as well as all the treasure were gone.

153
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,216
Takuma was puzzled,

154
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:29,316
but heard the following story from the owner of the storeroom.

155
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:34,613
Nothing important should be placed in the storeroom.

156
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,916
If anything is placed inside it, it will disappear instantly.

157
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,617
Because the treasure will be swallowed by the monster storeroom

158
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,716
that has a big appetite,

159
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:50,216
Don't tell me that the friend he was looking for was eaten up?

160
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,116
No, because he seems to have shown up

161
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:55,316
from a different place afterwards.

162
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,316
But, because of the shock,

163
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:03,116
Takuma seems to be haunted by nightmares every night.

164
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:05,416
He was absent, too.

165
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,116
I see. A haunted storeroom with a big appetite.

166
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:16,416
It is indeed the strange, eerie world of Ranpo Edogawa.

167
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,916
Ms. Kobyashi.

168
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,216
Where's Inspector Shiratori?

169
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:24,016
He left a while ago, humming a tune.

170
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,665
Never mind that, the problem is the storeroom.

171
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:30,216
We, the detective squad have to solve the case

172
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,671
of the haunted storeroom as soon as possible,

173
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:37,416
so that Takuma won't have to worry anymore.

174
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,516
-Let's go! -Wait!

175
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:44,216
I'm the advisor for the detective squad, you know? Don't ignore me!

176
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:46,016
Gosh.

177
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:51,616
If Ms. Kobayashi comes along, things get complicated.

178
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,716
She would says things like don't go in there,

179
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:56,016
or it's time to go home already.

180
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,916
She will just gets in the way.

181
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:02,416
Okay, since that storeroom in question is in 5 chome.

182
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,916
You want to get together

183
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,216
at the Mouri Detective Agency that's in the same district.

184
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:11,116
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Then, go inside and wait for me.

185
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,713
I'm going to leave a note to Ran

186
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,715
saying that I might be coming home late today.

187
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,916
It's something to look forward to, isn't it? The haunted storeroom.

188
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:28,316
But, what if the storeroom is really a monster?

189
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:29,816
No need to worry.

190
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,116
I'm sure that Conan will solve it

191
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,316
and find out that it's not a monster.

192
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:34,733
Yes!

193
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,816
I agree.

194
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:38,316
Come on...

195
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:43,016
All of you are always so dependent on Conan.

196
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:47,216
Don't you want to show him what you can do without him at times?

197
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,616
What?

198
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:52,751
That's impossible.

199
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,916
Because Conan's really smart.

200
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,757
He knows a lot of strange things, too.

201
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:02,116
I'm talking about your attitude.

202
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,763
You'll never grow up if you stay the way you are.

203
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,916
Uh, where are you going?

204
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,916
To the restroom.

205
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:11,816
I'm growing,

206
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:16,316
my mom told me that I grew again today.

207
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:20,779
But, I'd kind of like to see it.

208
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,116
The surprised look on Conan's face!

209
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:34,116
Yeah!

210
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,795
Yes, if only once, I'd like to see him depressed

211
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,216
because we solved the case without him.

212
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,416
No, what we just said...

213
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,416
Were all jokes.

214
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,216
All lies.

215
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:54,416
Sorry, thanks for waiting.

216
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,016
What're you all doing gathered around the desk?

217
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,916
Nothing.

218
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,816
Pops Kogoro went to the horse race and isn't home.

219
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:06,516
Huh? Where's Haibara?

220
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,316
Did you call me?

221
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,316
Let's hurry over to that storeroom, then!

222
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:15,416
Let's go there quickly and solve the case in a jiffy!

223
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:19,916
No case is left unsolved when it comes to we, the detective squad!

224
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:23,816
You guys are really out to get, aren't you?

225
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:25,816
Oh, does it look that way?

226
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:28,847
Well, us today...

227
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,616
It's true, that we're slightly different from the usual!

228
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:35,616
I don't care what.

229
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:38,316
But don't let your enthusiasm get the best of you.

230
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:40,016
Okay...

231
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:42,861
Let's go.

232
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,460
Oh, you're Takuma's friends.

233
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,460
That's why you came to check on the storeroom?

234
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,960
-Yes! -Because we're members of the detective squad!

235
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,160
Well, it's good that you're full of curiosity,

236
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,560
but be careful not to get too involved.

237
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,160
That the storeroom will eat you.

238
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,660
So he says.

239
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,360
We'll be fine, because most ghost stories

240
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,660
are illusions created out of the fear we have in our hearts.

241
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,260
They are no mysteries that cannot be solved in this world.

242
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
There is no such thing!

243
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Yeah.

244
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,660
It looks pretty old, but it's unexpectedly an ordinary storeroom.

245
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,360
It seems to have been built during the last days of Tokugawa.

246
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,925
What're you doing?

247
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,560
I'm taking pictures.

248
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,460
We're going to attempt solving the mystery of the storeroom soon.

249
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,960
So I see nothing wrong with taking pictures

250
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
of the surroundings around the storeroom.

251
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,360
That's right.

252
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,260
There, it's opened. Let's go inside.

253
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,945
Well, there's nothing inside, though.

254
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,060
It's really spacious.

255
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,660
But it's pitch dark and you can't virtually see anything.

256
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,560
The only thing that can barely

257
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,660
be seen is the light seeping in,

258
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,160
from the window over there by the ceiling.

259
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,860
Okay, let's go take loads of pictures of inside the storeroom.

260
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,160
Be careful! Watch your step because it's dark.

261
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,260
Conan?

262
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,360
Warning everybody to watch their steps

263
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,977
while you go and have a great fall.

264
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:42,981
Wrong. These stairs...

265
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,060
There are footprints of somebody having walked here.

266
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,260
Moreover, only in the centre of the storeroom.

267
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,993
It's not the footprints of a child.

268
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,760
That's an abacus?

269
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,660
The footprints are connected with the abacus

270
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,360
that is embedded into the wall.

271
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,013
There's something strange about the balls on the abacus.

272
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:19,017
Hey, there's nothing in there, is there?

273
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,860
I'm closing the door, so come on out!

274
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
Oh, okay.

275
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Hey, you guys, let's go!

276
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,960
Okay...

277
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,660
Are you satisfied, detective squad?

278
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,860
Yes, sort of.

279
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,037
Bye, then.

280
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:43,560
Oh, but can we check the storeroom again after sundown?

281
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,160
We promise to be quiet till then!

282
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,460
Please!

283
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,060
Okay, I don't mind.

284
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,760
I don't think you'll find anything, though.

285
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,460
It's that window, that Takuma looked in from, right?

286
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Yes, because that's the only window there is.

287
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,860
So, let's not wait till sundown,

288
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,760
but go take a look now.

289
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,360
And look at the treasure that Takuma saw.

290
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,075
Are you okay, Conan?

291
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,077
Please don't fall.

292
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,960
I'll bet you won't find anything.

293
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,760
We just looked inside a while ago!

294
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm just going to confirm once more.

295
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,087
I'll come down as soon as I look inside the storeroom.

296
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,460
Bring that old man back here right away!

297
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,460
Hey, I don't think there's anything, though.

298
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,660
See?

299
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,960
No way...

300
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,760
And did you see anything?

301
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,760
I saw it there, just a while ago.

302
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,360
The floor was filled with...

303
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,060
a heap of treasure!

304
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,131
Uh, you really saw it, didn't you?

305
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,133
Yeah.

306
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Just a while ago when I looked in from that window, I saw it!

307
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,660
The treasure filling the floor of the storeroom,

308
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,560
a heap of artworks and antiques!

309
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,860
But, isn't there's nothing?

310
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,153
That's why there's got to be something!

311
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,260
A way in which the treasure is made to vanish.

312
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,159
Maybe the floor's rigged or maybe the ceiling.

313
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,163
No, I don't think it's the ceiling.

314
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,460
What?

315
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,360
Proof of this is this picture that was taken with the cell phone!

316
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,760
This was taken when you climbed the tree

317
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,173
near the storeroom a while ago and looked inside.

318
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,560
The position of the window

319
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,860
is at about 2 meters from the top of the roof,

320
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,560
And that window also as viewed from inside the storeroom,

321
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
is about 2 meters from the ceiling!

322
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,189
In other words, there's no space on the ceiling

323
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,660
to set up some gadget!

324
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,760
Right.

325
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,560
Then all that's left is this floor.

326
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,860
Yeah. The floor probably comes off

327
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,660
and the real floor with the treasure all over it comes rising up.

328
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,205
No!

329
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,360
That's not possible either!

330
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
It's impossible!

331
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,211
What?

332
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:37,215
Come over here and look! See, this!

333
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,219
The detective squad badge.

334
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:45,223
The badge is surrounded with pencil lines.

335
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:49,227
I drew them! It's a mark showing where I put it!

336
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,560
My badge is over this way!

337
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,235
See! Mine hasn't moved either, right?

338
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,660
Yeah, moreover, it's pretty far from where Genta's one is.

339
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,860
I see.

340
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,245
In other words, there's no trace of this floor having slided

341
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,660
or tilted over a wide space.

342
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,251
Therefore, Conan's deduction about the floor opening up

343
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,255
and the real floor rising up is off the track.

344
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,259
You guys are pretty good,

345
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,760
You think so?

346
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,560
Please wait!

347
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,660
Is something the matter, Mitsuhiko?

348
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,269
There's something strange about this storeroom after all!

349
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,271
What's strange about it?

350
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,275
It's gone! My badge that I'm sure I put here!

351
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,660
What?

352
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,860
Are you sure you put it here?

353
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Yes, over there. I'm sure I left it standing against the wall.

354
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,287
Are you sure it's not on the floor somewhere?

355
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,291
I looked for it but couldn't find it!

356
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,560
Then, could it be that only the floor and wall around here moved

357
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,860
and the badge fell into the space in between.

358
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,301
Or...

359
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:07,305
could it be that someone who is hiding in this storeroom took it away.

360
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,307
Someone?

361
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,309
Don't tell me that...

362
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,760
A monster?

363
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,660
No way!

364
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,960
Didn't you say that ghosts

365
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,060
are illusions created out of the fear that people hold in their hearts?

366
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,321
True.

367
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,760
Well, at any rate,

368
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,860
there's no doubt that something's going on in this storeroom.

369
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,360
A trick similar to magic,

370
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,333
where the treasure can be put in and taken out in a short time.

371
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,423
"Ceiling"

373
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,852
Conan, we'll make you say "I lose" next week!

374
00:24:08,852 --> 00:24:10,800
-I lose. -You're supposed to say it next week.
