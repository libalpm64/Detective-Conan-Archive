1
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,247
Today's case is an unimaginable one.

2
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,547
One clue however, connects the seemingly unrelated cases

3
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:27,747
and solves the mystery perfectly!

4
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:29,247
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,047
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:33,147
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:59,231
Pop's is tailing somebody.

8
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:01,531
A person by the name of Shoichiro Hitomi

9
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,631
falls to his death from the Beika Hotel.

10
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,731
At the same time, his twin kid brother, Takehiko,

11
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:13,731
is found killed by someone at his home in Haido-cho.

12
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:21,231
Could this have been synchronicity, a so called fateful coincidence?

13
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,431
"Shoichiro, Takehiko" -Wrong.

14
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,631
"Kanako, Kaoru Minamizato" -This is not a case of synchronicity.

15
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:27,131
The line that connects Kaoru with the others.

16
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,731
If I can figure out what that is, the mystery would be solved.

17
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,731
Why did Shoichiro attack,

18
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,031
rather, try to kill Kaoru?

19
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,231
For what reason?

20
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:43,831
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 2)"

21
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,931
Pops, about this picture.

22
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,431
What about it?

23
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:59,231
Ms. Kaoru Minimizato went to the front desk

24
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,931
after Shoichiro made the call, right?

25
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,031
Right.

26
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:05,731
Back then, what was it that Kaoru said?

27
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,731
Huh?

28
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,531
Uh...

29
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:13,631
Did you receive anything for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

30
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,931
That person call Mr. Anzai.

31
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:19,431
Aren't you going to ask Kaoru about him one more time?

32
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:20,731
Shut up!

33
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:22,631
What seems to be the matter, Mouri?

34
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,631
I'd like to talk to Kaoru once more.

35
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,631
Wait for me, dad!

36
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:28,731
Pops!

37
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,031
Who are you?

38
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,731
What was that?

39
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,131
I think it came from Kaoru's room.

40
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,631
What?

41
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,031
Kaoru! Kaoru!

42
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,431
Kaoru!

43
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:09,231
Darn, they just fixed the door a while ago, not again...

44
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:10,931
But, I don't have a choice.

45
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:16,331
Kaoru!

46
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,131
Dad, nab him!

47
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,331
Okay!

48
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,531
I'm so sorry!

49
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:42,931
She's still okay, get the ambulance.

50
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:46,131
"Beika Central Hospital"

51
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:50,431
I was in a relationship with Mr. Manabu Anzai

52
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,031
when I was living in the Kansai District.

53
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:09,331
We were also going to get married,

54
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,831
but 6 months ago...

55
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:22,301
His whereabouts suddenly became unknown.

56
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,301
Is that right?

57
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:27,501
Well, I'm sorry to have suspected you.

58
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,401
I'm sure the man was only after your money.

59
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:34,101
Have you filed an offense report?

60
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:38,601
No. I wanted to see him and confirm things before doing so.

61
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:42,401
But, if you don't even know where he is...

62
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,201
Well, I came here because I was told that

63
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:48,401
he was seen in Tokyo somewhere.

64
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:55,101
But, when it actually came to looking for him,

65
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,101
I had no idea where to start looking.

66
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:59,301
Other than his name Mr. Anzai,

67
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:03,301
I realized that I didn't know where he was born or where he worked.

68
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:06,401
Rather, I didn't know anything about him.

69
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,901
He didn't say anything deliberately.

70
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:13,901
If so, it's doubtful whether Anzai is his real name or not either.

71
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:17,001
The only clue that I have, is a picture of him.

72
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,401
What?

73
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:21,601
May we have a look at it?

74
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:24,901
I met Mr. Anzai on a diving trip,

75
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,601
so I figured he'd be diving over here too.

76
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:31,101
I've been looking for him here and there

77
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:35,701
with the picture and contact number of Beika Hotel, but...

78
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,701
He's!

79
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,701
What's up, Conan?

80
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,901
Pops, show me your digital camera.

81
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,801
Okay.

82
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:52,201
See, it's him.

83
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,501
Please try to remember, dad.

84
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,901
Wasn't there anything between this man and Shoichiro?

85
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:06,601
No, not that I can recall, I think.

86
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:11,201
Where is that? I'll try and go there.

87
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,701
No, let us handle this.

88
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,701
I'm a detective so I'm used to looking for people.

89
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:20,201
By the way, the man that attacked you a while ago,

90
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:22,701
wasn't he Mr. Anzai?

91
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:26,001
Oh, I wonder.

92
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,401
Oh no... I don't know.

93
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:32,001
"Beika Sports Center"

94
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:35,101
It's this man in the picture.

95
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,101
Oh, you mean Mr. Tanizaki.

96
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,501
Tanizaki? His name is not Anzai?

97
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,301
Yes, I'm certain that this is Mr. Tanizaki.

98
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,601
He was using an alias after all.

99
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,801
Well, who knows if Tanizaki is his real name either though.

100
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,301
"Tennis Club Parking Lot"

101
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,801
Mr. Tanizaki.

102
00:07:56,801 --> 00:08:00,401
Rather, should I call you Mr. Anzai?

103
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,901
May I ask what this is all about?

104
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,101
You know Ms. Kaoru Minamizato, don't you?

105
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,701
Who's that? No, I don't.

106
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,601
Please don't play dumb with me.

107
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,101
I'm sorry, Shin.

108
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:17,301
For making you wait.

109
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,501
Oh, who is that lady?

110
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,901
Who is this old man?

111
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,301
It's nothing. He's got the wrong person.

112
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,601
Hurry up and get in.

113
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,101
I just got mail from daddy saying

114
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,401
that he'd come up with the money for us!

115
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:42,401
Oh, thanks, you're a life-saver.

116
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:45,801
It's okay, anything for you, Shin.

117
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,101
I see.

118
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,601
Just as I thought.

119
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:02,501
I hate to say this, but I guess he had deceived you.

120
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,501
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako, Kaoru" -I see,

121
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:08,901
it's not all there is to it.

122
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,401
One more man...

123
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,101
whatever his name is, Tanizaki or Anzai,

124
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,601
that guy is involved in this case.

125
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,601
Kaoru's probably not the only one

126
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,201
who'd been deceived by this guy.

127
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,101
Including the woman that we saw a while ago,

128
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,101
he probably deceived several others more.

129
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:28,901
If Kaoru found out, she would indict him.

130
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,801
That's why he wanted to shut Kaoru up.

131
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,301
There is a motive for him to kill.

132
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,301
In other words, Shoichiro and that guy

133
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,301
are connected to each other with the sports center.

134
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:43,401
But this can be brushed away as mere coincidence.

135
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:57,801
Shoichiro's accidental death.

136
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,001
"Takehiko Hitomi, (45)" -And Takehiko's homicide

137
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,901
which occurred at the same time.

138
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:08,001
And Kaoru's assault and battery case.

139
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:12,501
"Unknow man" -I've got to figure this one out after all.

140
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,401
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako, Kaoru"

141
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,501
Wait a sec.

142
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,101
I get it.

143
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,001
So that's the story!

144
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,445
"Beika Hotel"

145
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,445
Ran.

146
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,645
What is it, Conan?

147
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:39,945
Pops told me to tell you to take pictures of these diagrams

148
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,745
because he'll be using them later.

149
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:02,145
Mouri, everyone's here.

150
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,745
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:07,345
Thank you all for coming.

152
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,545
And, what is this?

153
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,045
What're you going to start?

154
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,945
I'm going to unravel the mystery of the two cases.

155
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,545
Cases?

156
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:19,345
Wasn't Shoichiro's case an accident?

157
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,345
Whether it was an accident or had to do with synchronicity,

158
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:23,645
everything fit too well into place.

159
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:27,545
Until it makes people feel very abnormal.

160
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:32,045
In other words, a frightening perfect murder was being schemed.

161
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,345
Perfect crime?

162
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,745
Yes, if it worked out the way it should've.

163
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,345
Ran, is the monitor ready?

164
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:41,845
Okay.

165
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:46,045
To be honest, I was concerned about something from the very beginning.

166
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:49,445
Despite owning a cell phone,

167
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:53,845
Shoichiro made a call using the public phone in the lobby of the hotel.

168
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:57,045
Although the place was not even an out of service range area.

169
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,845
He did so

170
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,645
because he didn't want anyone to know who he was calling.

171
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,645
Why didn't he want anybody to know?

172
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:09,445
He didn't want to leave any evidence behind.

173
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,145
Just in case he had to justify himself and this evidence

174
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:12,745
would work against him.

175
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:16,045
Oh, and who was the person on the other side of the line?

176
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:20,345
Most probably the woman who was staying at this hotel...

177
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:26,245
Kaoru Minamizato.

178
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:36,945
Kaoru, what were the contents of the phone call

179
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:39,245
that you received back then?

180
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:44,245
Well, that he received something from Mr. Anzai

181
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:47,445
and had taken it to the front desk.

182
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:51,445
But I was told that the front desk didn't have anything for me.

183
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:54,245
Why did he lie and make that phone call?

184
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:57,445
Because he didn't know Ms. Kaoru's face.

185
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:58,945
Who didn't know?

186
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,945
Shoichiro.

187
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,045
That's why he called Ms. Kaoru to confirm what she looked like.

188
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,545
And...

189
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:30,945
He ambushed Kaoru, then attacked her.

190
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:33,645
However, I happened to be there.

191
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:37,445
Shoichiro who attempted to flee from the veranda...

192
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:48,145
But, why did he attack me, who he didn't know at all?

193
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:52,345
Because it would be very convenient for the culprit.

194
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,645
If he didn't know you at all, he would not have a motive.

195
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:59,345
In other words, he would not be suspected either.

196
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:03,545
I don't really understand what you're trying to get at.

197
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:07,345
Kanako, do know why Shoichiro called you

198
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,845
to tell you to come all the way to Beika?

199
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,945
About that...

200
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:15,645
So that my husband wouldn't find out?

201
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,645
No, he used you for his alibi.

202
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:21,345
To establish an alibi?

203
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:25,845
Shoichiro has no motive to kill Kaoru.

204
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,045
However...

205
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,245
You're fired, get out of here, this minute!

206
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:36,345
He has a motive to kill Takehiko.

207
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:39,745
But, he could've established his alibi any other way.

208
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,945
Yes.

209
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:44,545
But the fact was, he had another important purpose.

210
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:47,545
It was to make Kanako leave the house

211
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:50,245
and make sure that Takehiko was at home alone.

212
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:54,545
After all, it would be troublesome to have Kanako at home,

213
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,945
-if he wanted to murder Takehiko. -What?

214
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,845
Please try to remember,

215
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,745
the call you received from Shoichiro.

216
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:03,745
What was his first question?

217
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:04,945
Is Takehiko here?

218
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,745
Yes, he is.

219
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:08,945
He wanted to know where Takehiko was.

220
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,645
And he made sure Takehiko was home,

221
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,345
he went on to say that he wanted to see you.

222
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,345
Can you come out to Beika?

223
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,745
Okay.

224
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:20,745
In front of the station at 12.30 pm. See you.

225
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:21,945
He called you on his cell phone

226
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:24,045
from the toilet of the sports center.

227
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:27,445
I'm pretty sure that there was one other person near him at that time.

228
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:30,545
Shoichiro probably checked on

229
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,945
the whereabouts of Takehiko for this person,

230
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,145
as well as lure Kanako out.

231
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,545
Ran, can you display the relationship connection diagram?

232
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:39,745
Okay.

233
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,545
At first glance, it looks to be a case

234
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:44,645
that is complicatedly interwoven,

235
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,045
But if we omit Kanako,

236
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:50,445
who was just used to carry out the murders...

237
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,145
It's true it starts to look way more simple.

238
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,545
But, who is that character to the lower right?

239
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:59,345
There's Shoichiro who has murderous feelings towards Takehiko

240
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:01,645
and as for Kaoru, the man over there,

241
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:05,345
who uses an array of aliases had murderous feelings towards her.

242
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:08,345
I guess we'll just call you Mr. Anzai for now.

243
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:10,745
Murderous feelings that would never had intersected

244
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:13,845
and a plan to carry them out was established,

245
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:17,045
when Shoichiro and you, Mr. Anzai encountered each other.

246
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,745
A plan for exchange murder!

247
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:25,845
You must've really panicked, Mr. Azai,

248
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:28,245
when you succeeded carrying out your part of the deal,

249
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:33,845
and Shoichiro goofed, on top of getting himself killed.

250
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:35,945
Because of this,

251
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:40,645
you ended up having to kill Kaoru with your own hands.

252
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:47,945
Therefore, you head off to Beika Hotel by yourself.

253
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,545
An exchange murder?

254
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,545
Say what you like.

255
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:04,545
Do you have evidence, though? Some kind of definite proof?

256
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:08,045
Dad.

257
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:12,545
Well, of course, that's an understandable remark.

258
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:15,945
Inspector Megure, were you able to find the thing in question

259
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:18,345
in the vicinity of Takehiko's residence?

260
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:22,945
Yeah, it came out of a trash can of a nearby park.

261
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:25,145
That's the key of our house.

262
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:29,945
Kanako, that's the key that you gave to Shoichiro, isn't it?

263
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,645
-Yes. -Strangely enough,

264
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:36,245
this key was not found among Shoichiro's belongings.

265
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,545
He had given it to Mr. Anzai.

266
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,345
Since he had no intention of getting it back,

267
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,345
so maybe it's more appropriate to say, he gave it to you.

268
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:53,345
As for you, Mr. Anzai, although you used the key to go into the house,

269
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:56,545
figuring that it would only serve as evidence if you have it on you,

270
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,345
you decided to throw it away.

271
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:01,745
Why was the window cracked, then?

272
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:06,245
Of course it was just to make it look as if a robber had broken in.

273
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:09,145
There was no meaning for him to leave the key back in the room,

274
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:12,845
so he locked the door and left.

275
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:16,045
Amazing how you deduced that far.

276
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:19,945
Please think back to where Takehiko was lying on the floor.

277
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:22,645
It was right by the front door, wasn't it?

278
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:25,145
If the window had been cracked first,

279
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,045
even though Takehiko was in the living room,

280
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:31,045
he would've headed for the study to check out what happened.

281
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:35,945
However, he in fact, heard someone come in from the front door...

282
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:40,845
He ran into you, Mr. Anzai as you came in,

283
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:42,845
and was killed.

284
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:53,245
Did you find any fingerprints on the key or what?

285
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:57,545
No, you must've wiped it off before getting rid of it.

286
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:00,345
It doesn't matter either way.

287
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,745
If you have no evidence,

288
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:04,445
sorry, but I think I'm leaving.

289
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,345
Then, how about something like this?

290
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,145
-Ran, can you take out the picture, please? -Yes.

291
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:13,845
What is it?

292
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,945
Looking for a mistake.

293
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:19,045
Will everyone here look very carefully?

294
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:20,045
The picture to the left

295
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:22,845
is Mr. Anzai before he goes into the restroom.

296
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:26,945
The picture to the right is Mr. Anzai when he comes out.

297
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,945
The key!

298
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,845
You have no way out at this point.

299
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,345
Admit your shameful deeds.

300
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:05,545
When I was shown the picture at a diving shop I used to frequent,

301
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,245
shivers went through my spine.

302
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,745
I somehow made it through back then,

303
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:13,345
but when I thought of the time that Kaoru eventually finds me...

304
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,245
It was just around that time.

305
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:21,145
Darn, that Takehiko.

306
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:23,445
He can just drop dead for all I care.

307
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:28,245
He can just drop dead.

308
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:37,845
What do you say we commit exchange murders?

309
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,445
Even if we do get caught, we would have no motive,

310
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:43,045
and besides, we'll have a perfect alibi.

311
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,745
Let me sleep on it.

312
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:50,045
I've gone as far as tell you this much,

313
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,945
I really don't want you to refuse this offer.

314
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:56,645
He was not all for it to begin with,

315
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:58,845
but after I convinced him that we would never be caught,

316
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,745
he decided to do it.

317
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:05,245
So, you're the one who talked him into this after all.

318
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:08,445
By the way, Shoichiro seems to have repented

319
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:12,145
after realizing what a serious crime he had committed.

320
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,045
Sorry, I don't know what's come over me.

321
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:16,745
Please overlook this.

322
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:22,045
He was probably cornered to no end.

323
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:25,845
That's why he was conned into going along with your plan.

324
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:28,045
A disgusting crime.

325
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:29,945
You're really going to have to make amends.

326
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,745
"Chiezo Nekura, (31). Frequent offenders, arrest!"

327
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,345
After his face was seen in the newspapers

328
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,745
people claiming that they were victimized came out one after the other.

329
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:07,245
He must've been a real villain.

330
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,645
Villain is just enough to describe his abhorrence.

331
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:13,945
That's why he comes up with an idea like exchange murders.

332
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:18,545
I wonder if this was a case of synchronicity too.

333
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:22,545
Because the fact that dad was tailing Shoichiro,

334
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:26,645
and dad bursting into the room when Shoichiro attacked Kaoru

335
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,345
were all coincidences, right?

336
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:33,445
You gotta remember when Kaoru was attacked by that man too.

337
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,845
If I didn't say let's go back, she would've been in serious danger.

338
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:39,245
It was me who said that.

339
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:40,945
Oh, well, who cares?

340
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:43,645
I wonder if this is synchronicity too.

341
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:45,145
What is, Conan?

342
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:48,045
Whenever Pops successfully solves a case,

343
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:51,145
we're coincidentally always blessed!

344
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:53,045
-What? -Dad.

345
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,945
This is all thanks to my wisdom and chance!

346
00:23:55,945 --> 00:23:57,545
Dad.

347
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:34,672
Next Conan's Hint:

348
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,272
"Fishing terminology"

349
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:40,972
Tune in next week to the grand scale tricks filled 1 hour special!
