1
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,924
In today's case, the suspect is a police officer's friend.

2
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,324
How far will the love of the two go

3
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,024
after overcoming the obstacle filled scene?

4
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:29,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:31,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:33,224
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,609
Hearing that he would be dispatched to Tottori

8
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,409
to work on a joint investigation project,

9
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,309
Officer Takagi is flustered.

10
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:06,509
Despite the fact that they may have to be separated for three years,

11
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,709
Officer Sato remains the same as always.

12
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,009
While all this is going on,

13
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,809
we happen to witness the suspect of a homicide case.

14
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,109
And...

15
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,009
"Yui Shimura" -You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi, aren't you?

16
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,509
What? Me? Commit murder?

17
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,809
"Akira Kato" -Just what are you talking about? Out of the blue like that.

18
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:26,609
What's going on? Cut out the noise.

19
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:27,809
What?

20
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,709
-What? -Officer Chiba?

21
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,609
This is interesting.

22
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:41,409
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 2)"

23
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,009
Hey, Chiba! Come here.

24
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,609
Oh, yes, sir.

25
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:46,809
What is it?

26
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,309
Chiba!

27
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,609
Hey! Chiba! Is it true?

28
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,309
What you said about being with that man

29
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,209
and watching TV with him during the time of the crime?

30
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,709
You're not lying, are you?

31
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,409
Chiba! I'm asking if you swear by this Cherry Blossom crest!

32
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,509
Yes, sir! I swear!

33
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:19,509
I see.

34
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,009
Sorry.

35
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,109
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

36
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:30,909
Being a police officer is a crummy job.

37
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,409
Think...

38
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,409
Hurry, the continuation...

39
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,409
Next it's finally episode four!

40
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,709
Yaiba's archrival the Potato Baron appears!

41
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,609
"The Conspiracy of the Potato Baron!"

42
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,609
Come to think of it. If I remember correctly...

43
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,409
No doubt about it!

44
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,609
The killer is Mr. Kato after all!

45
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,909
He deceived Officer Chiba and used him to establish his alibi.

46
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:33,109
He twisted the passage of time with blood smeared hands.

47
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,509
I can't find a thing.

48
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,609
Neither can I find the gray parka nor the black knapsack

49
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,609
that the suspicious looking man had on him.

50
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,809
How is it over there?

51
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:46,709
Nothing here.

52
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,409
How about over there?

53
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,409
Nothing anywhere.

54
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,609
It doesn't seem to be around.

55
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:54,709
I guess not.

56
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,109
Not here, anyways.

57
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,609
I guess Mr. Kato who is freeloading here with you

58
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,909
is not a suspect after all.

59
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,809
Yeah.

60
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:08,409
Then, who on earth is it?

61
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,409
The man that looked like Mr. Kato

62
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,009
that the children saw near the crime scene.

63
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,009
He was probably another man who looked very much like him!

64
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,409
Because during the time of the crime,

65
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,309
Mr. Kato has an alibi that he was here watching "Morning Live Seven"

66
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,109
with Officer Chiba.

67
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,209
Okay, we'll leave for now!

68
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,509
We've got to send the children home too.

69
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,409
Anyway, that's enough for today.

70
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,909
Gosh.

71
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:45,309
Inspector Megure told me to learn something from this veteran officer.

72
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,209
But at this rate...

73
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,209
Hey, Officer Chiba.

74
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,409
Officer Chiba!

75
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,509
Oh, yes!

76
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,809
Will you go get Mr. Kato who's waiting in the police car?

77
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,509
We can't go home without telling him goodbye.

78
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,909
I'll go get him!

79
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,609
So, we've got to start all over again.

80
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,609
I hope it won't take too long.

81
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:13,309
Take too long?

82
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,209
Wait. If it takes long for this case to be solved...

83
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,109
Maybe I won't have to be dispatched to Tottori for the joint investigation

84
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:23,309
and stay here with Officer Sato.

85
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,409
You idiot! Just what's wrong with you?

86
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,009
I'm a police officer,

87
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,109
so I've got to solve the case as soon as possible.

88
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:31,709
Hey, this is no time to be absorbed in your thoughts.

89
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,209
Don't worry.

90
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,309
I'll make sure I get this case solved before leaving for Tottori.

91
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,909
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,109
Well, if it's going to take long,

93
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,609
just have someone else to take over the case.

94
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:43,909
It's as simple as that.

95
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,409
That's right.

96
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,809
Everything will be fine.

97
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,409
What?

98
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,109
Everything will be fine, Officer Takagi.

99
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,309
I don't think'll take that long.

100
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,909
I've been telling you, haven't I?

101
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:05,709
During the time of the crime from 7 am to 7:30 am,

102
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,109
I was watching TV together with Chiba in the living room!

103
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,609
Come...

104
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,909
Excuse me, Mr. Kato!

105
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,109
What was that program you were watching?

106
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,909
Like I said, "Morning Live Seven"!

107
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:20,109
Which one?

108
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,109
Which one but the one aired on Nichiuri TV from 7 am?

109
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,509
But...

110
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:27,809
See.

111
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,909
"Morning Live Seven" is also playing on cable TV

112
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,409
from 9 am in the morning too.

113
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,409
"Morning Live Seven"

114
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,009
True.

115
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:39,709
Which means...

116
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,909
even if it were to take an hour and a half by car from here.

117
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,409
He could've killed Mr. Nakamoto at a little after 7 am,

118
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:50,709
come back here, wake Officer Chiba up at 9 am

119
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,309
and watch "Morning Live Seven" playing on cable TV together,

120
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:56,709
it seems possible for him to establish a fake alibi.

121
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,809
Chiba you said that you both drank last night

122
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:04,909
and you fell asleep in the living room, right?

123
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,009
Yes.

124
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,309
Officer Sato.

125
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,009
If he made Chiba drink to make him groggy in the morning,

126
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,809
and if Chiba who was awakened in the morning still half asleep.

127
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,709
He probably wouldn't have realized it if it were the cable TV program.

128
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,109
Wait a minute!

129
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,909
I could've been half asleep

130
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,009
but you can't trick the video, can you?

131
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,409
The video I recorded this morning of "Morning Live Seven" cooking corner

132
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,709
had the time and everything recorded too, didn't it?

133
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,409
If it's the "Morning Live Seven" that played on cable TV

134
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,609
the time wouldn't be displayed!

135
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:36,509
It's aired two hours later, you know.

136
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,709
That's true too.

137
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,409
Besides, after watching Morning Live till 8 am,

138
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,109
we watched a six hours video.

139
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:46,309
And like I was saying he was with me all the time

140
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,309
while we watched the live baseball broadcast from 2 pm,

141
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,809
when Officer Chosuke and all of you came part way through the game.

142
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:52,909
The only time I wasn't with him was

143
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,809
when I went to take a bath for about 30 minutes.

144
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,609
It would've been impossible for him

145
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:01,009
to even make it to the crime scene that would've taken

146
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,409
more than an hour by car.

147
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,509
Well, I took a bath after watching the video halfway,

148
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,409
I think it was about 11 am

149
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:11,009
so I think it would be impossible for him to commit the crime.

150
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,209
But...

151
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,709
There's a lot you can do with 30 minutes.

152
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,609
You can make coffee,

153
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,909
Watch TV.

154
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,309
Dub videos.

155
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,109
Dubbing?

156
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,909
Right! Dubbing videos.

157
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,354
I see!

158
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:41,054
If he had set the timer to record "Morning Live Seven" before going out,

159
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:44,054
he could've dubbed it over the cable TV program

160
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,054
that Officer Chiba recorded!

161
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:50,154
Moreover, what he taped was "Yoko Okino's Four-minute Cooking"!

162
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:54,054
Since there are two decks so 30 minutes would be more than enough!

163
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,754
But if there's no time display,

164
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,654
I think I would have noticed when I recorded the program.

165
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:02,254
Oh, I wonder about that?

166
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:06,854
Those memo stickers that are stuck all over the TV.

167
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:11,654
If you're used to seeing those memos on the set all the time,

168
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,454
even if you can't see the time display on the upper left,

169
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:16,554
you would just figure

170
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,754
that's the reason why you can't see the time,

171
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,954
and it wouldn't even bother you, right?

172
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,954
You seem to have known that

173
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,754
the cooking corner was after the weather forecast

174
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:29,754
so you don't have to see the time to record it.

175
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,754
And, you also mentioned that the flash news about Hide

176
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:36,654
was displayed on the screen during "Morning Live Seven", right?

177
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:37,654
Yeah.

178
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:39,854
If the program that you were watching was really

179
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:43,054
the news variety program from 7 am,

180
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:46,554
I think they would have talked about that news during the program.

181
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:48,354
In other words, even if it's a live program if it's a recording,

182
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:51,954
new news coverage is impossible?

183
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:52,954
Chiba!

184
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,354
You said that the news on the video

185
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,754
wasn't mentioned in the program, right?

186
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,554
Yeah.

187
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,954
I think that sort of news was on display

188
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:03,354
when Chiba left to go to the restroom.

189
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,754
But, don't forget.

190
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:11,354
We were watching the Masked Yaiba video from 8 am for six hours!

191
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:14,154
If you include the time that Chiba was taking a bath,

192
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,554
it's six and a half hours!

193
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:17,654
If we were watching "Morning Live Seven"

194
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,754
on cable TV from 9 am to 10 am,

195
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:23,354
then we would've finished watching the video at 4 pm or 4:30 pm.

196
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:27,454
The live baseball broadcast was until 4 pm so it would've been finished,

197
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:31,754
and you all came here a little before 4 pm, right?

198
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,354
Now that he mentions it, that's true.

199
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:35,854
So, I wouldn't have had the time.

200
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:40,454
What time did you begin watching the Masked Yaiba video?

201
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:42,954
So, like I've been telling you! At 8 am in the morning!

202
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:45,354
Not you, but them!

203
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:50,654
A little before we began searching this room so...

204
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,354
About 4:10 pm.

205
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:55,654
Which means about two hours have passed since they started watching.

206
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:56,754
Right.

207
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:58,354
Hey, you guys.

208
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:00,054
What episode are you watching now?

209
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,754
Here goes! Secret technique Yaiba Thunder God Fist!

210
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:09,354
Hey! Tell me what episode you're watching!

211
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,454
The last scene of episode six!

212
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:12,954
This is the good part, you know?

213
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,754
Stop bugging us, Conan!

214
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:16,754
Episode six?

215
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,354
What is the meaning of this?

216
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:19,954
If the episodes are 30 minutes long,

217
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:22,454
three hours should've gone by.

218
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:24,254
-Tomorrow is another day! -Mitsuhiko!

219
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:25,654
-Go, our hero! -Hurry! The continuation!

220
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,654
-Masked Yaiba! -Yes, yes!

221
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,354
The next one is...

222
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:31,254
I see! The commercials!

223
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:33,054
It's not only the commercials...

224
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:36,154
They can't wait to watch the next episode

225
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:39,354
that they're skipping the opening theme song as well as the end,

226
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:43,154
preview of the next episode and the summary of the previous episode.

227
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:46,754
So, it only takes them a little more than 20 minutes to watch an episode.

228
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:50,354
Were you doing that too, Chiba?

229
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,754
Yeah. Probably.

230
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:56,054
Then, watching 12 episodes would be 240 minutes.

231
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:58,254
That's only four hours!

232
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,354
I see.

233
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:01,754
Between 9 am to 10 am,

234
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:04,854
if programs that were two hours delayed

235
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:07,654
followed by that video was shown to Chiba,

236
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,054
the discrepancy in time would be compensated,

237
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:13,154
and you'd make it for the live baseball broadcast at 2 pm.

238
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:15,954
Very smart, sonny.

239
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:19,054
Moreover, since Chiba took a bath part way,

240
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:21,854
his concept of time could've been thrown off a bit.

241
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:26,354
Even if he were to watch the baseball game from after it started,

242
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:28,154
he wouldn't be able to tell how much time passed,

243
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,554
so, time can be connected very conveniently!

244
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:31,954
But Chiba went to the restroom

245
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,954
and to the kitchen to get drinks too!

246
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:35,854
Didn't you look at the clock then?

247
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:40,354
Yeah. I didn't think there was anything odd going on though.

248
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,354
So, he must've rigged it, right?

249
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:46,254
Rigged?

250
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,554
The clock?

251
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:52,154
He rigged the clock two hours backwards before waking Officer Chiba up.

252
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:54,954
He moved the hands of the clock here in the living room and the kitchen.

253
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,754
While Officer Chiba was absorbed in watching the video,

254
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,654
Mr. Kato slowly moved the clock back to the original time, right?

255
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:02,654
I see.

256
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:06,354
The living room clock is opposite the TV,

257
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,854
and as for the clock in the kitchen,

258
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:09,954
if you close the door you can't see a thing,

259
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:12,354
so it'll be easy to move the hands of the clock!

260
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:15,254
But there are clocks in the bedroom and the front entrance too.

261
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,354
Officer Chiba fell asleep in this living room last night.

262
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:22,854
And when he took a bath, his change of clothes are here

263
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,854
so the clock in the bedroom was probably left untouched,

264
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:27,454
thinking that Officer Chiba wouldn't go there anyway.

265
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:29,154
Then, what about the clock at the front entrance?

266
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:31,654
He can't touch the clock at the front entrance!

267
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,254
When the courier comes at the specified time,

268
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,654
and the time on the clock is not right, it'll be odd!

269
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,854
I see.

270
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:41,254
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Kato made sure that

271
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,854
when somebody came to the door,

272
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:47,554
he would answer it in place of Officer Chiba.

273
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,454
Come to think of it, when we got here you...

274
00:14:51,454 --> 00:14:54,254
Hey, kid! Where do you have such proof?

275
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:57,354
Why don't you ask Officer Chiba, then?

276
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,454
What?

277
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:01,954
Kato.

278
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:06,054
The clocks in this house were all set five minutes early.

279
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:07,954
So that I wouldn't over sleep.

280
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,254
I just went to check

281
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:13,754
but only the clock in the living room and the kitchen

282
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:18,154
had been returned to the original time by someone.

283
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:22,054
Kato! You're the only one who could've...

284
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,754
You gotta be kidding!

285
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:27,754
I'm called a killer just because your clocks were delayed!

286
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:32,054
If you suspect me, show me proof that I killed the guy!

287
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:35,354
I'm sure that it can be found on the way here.

288
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:38,254
It's been found!

289
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:39,454
Just now.

290
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:42,954
Between the scene of the crime and here,

291
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,754
at the bottom of the Teimuzu River,

292
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:47,754
the black knapsack was found with a weight tied on it.

293
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:50,954
Inside it were a blood smeared shirt and slacks

294
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,754
as well as a parka smeared with blood on the inside,

295
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:58,154
which he seems to have been wearing on top of shirt.

296
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,554
Moreover, here and there on the knapsack,

297
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:03,554
there seemed to be blackened red fingerprints

298
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:06,854
which probably got on there when he took off his shirt

299
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:09,754
that was splattered with the blood of the victim.

300
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:13,654
And, of course, you know who those fingerprints belong to, don't you?

301
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:19,754
Well, it seems that the car you rented last night

302
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:23,154
was also found at a nearby parking lot,

303
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:25,554
so we'll check it out later too.

304
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,254
That's a problem.

305
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,554
As for those red fingerprints,

306
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,054
I was going to wipe them off clean later,

307
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:34,254
that they're still all over the car.

308
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:35,954
So, it was you, after all!

309
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,754
You used me?

310
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:41,654
You deceived me to establish your alibi.

311
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:44,454
Yeah. I figured since you're a cop,

312
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:47,454
the police would believe your testimony.

313
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:49,254
Kato, how dare you!

314
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,654
Sorry. I couldn't think of any other way

315
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:56,554
to let out my anger of having my girl taken away.

316
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:58,454
I knew that my girl's feelings for me had faded

317
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:02,054
while I was abroad on my business trip

318
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,654
so I wasn't all that shocked

319
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,854
when I heard that she was getting married to Nakamoto.

320
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:09,454
But, I couldn't take it when I went to give him a piece of my mind

321
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,854
and I was shown the letters and postcards that I had sent.

322
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:15,654
He had the nerve to say, "What a push over",

323
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,954
while grinning as he threw them at me.

324
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,254
All the postcards and unopened letters

325
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:22,554
that I had written while I was abroad.

326
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:24,754
So, he probably kept them from her even

327
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:27,254
before she could read them.

328
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:32,554
That's what made me lose my temper.

329
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,754
I was so furious

330
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:36,154
that I didn't even notice all the clocks here

331
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:39,654
were set five minutes earlier.

332
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:43,254
The sneakers that you saw inside the shoe cabinet?

333
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,454
Yeah.

334
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:47,154
The seams of the shoe strings were damp

335
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:50,454
while all the other shoes were clean and dry.

336
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:52,154
Wouldn't you think it's strange?

337
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,254
If he washed it, he would've removed the shoe strings at least, right?

338
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:58,654
So, that's how you figured the killer was Mr. Kato!

339
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,054
That he hastily dried his shoes with a dryer

340
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:05,254
after he washed the mud from the rain off his shoes.

341
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,254
Right!

342
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:09,454
And after that I dispatched investigators to places

343
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,254
between here and the scene of the crime

344
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:14,454
where he may have thrown the black knapsack away.

345
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:16,354
I did it all after I confirmed that Chiba wasn't lying

346
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,254
to protect his friend.

347
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:20,954
I didn't want to think that way,

348
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:23,454
but if Chiba were an accomplice,

349
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:26,054
they would've thrown the stuff away somewhere farther.

350
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,754
What do you mean?

351
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:33,054
Then you suspected Officer Chiba too?

352
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,354
Yeah!

353
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:37,354
A police officer is a crummy job

354
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:41,354
where you have to suspect even the nicest people.

355
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,654
I'll bet Officer Chiba who is facing that man

356
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,754
in the interrogation room right now

357
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:47,454
is taking the blow right now.

358
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:51,354
See you.

359
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:53,454
I'll leave the rest up to you.

360
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,454
Yes, sir. We'll take the children home.

361
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:03,654
I get to sit in the front seat!

362
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:06,154
What again? That's not fair!

363
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:10,454
Genta! You should let us sit in the passenger's seat sometimes too!

364
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:14,854
Come... Don't fight and hurry inside!

365
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,354
Okay, it's stone-paper-scissors!

366
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,754
Conan, come here please!

367
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:18,754
Never mind him!

368
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:20,754
Right!

369
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,154
Police officer.

370
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:23,654
A police officer is a crummy job

371
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:26,554
where you have to suspect even the nicest people.

372
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:29,354
Officer Sato, aren't you going to doubt me?

373
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,254
I'm going to Tottori, you know?

374
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:37,554
I might be hit on by some cute co-worker.

375
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,254
If you really like me...

376
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,454
If you even have a tinge of feeling for me.

377
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:44,454
Hey! Come on, get in.

378
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:47,954
You could at least show a tinge of anxiety or something.

379
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,054
Officer Sato.

380
00:19:57,054 --> 00:20:00,054
Who is it? Who's the one that played a prank like this?

381
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,754
-How terrible! -Gosh.

382
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:05,254
This is a challenge to the police!

383
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:07,954
Oh, no, that's what Officer Sato did herself.

384
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:12,054
What?

385
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:13,654
You mean she's a bit concerned?

386
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:15,054
No way.

387
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:17,354
You won't, right?

388
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,354
Cheat on me...

389
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:26,154
What? Of course not.

390
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,654
Even if a super cute mini skirt police woman

391
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:32,854
or a sexy actress comes to the station as one day chief of police?

392
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:34,154
You really won't?

393
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:39,454
Officer Sato.

394
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:47,454
I'll go over there and become a fine police officer!

395
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,654
So...

396
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:52,754
So, before I go...

397
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:57,754
Please...

398
00:20:57,754 --> 00:20:59,854
Engage...

399
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:01,254
Where are you going?

400
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:02,354
What?

401
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,154
Inspector Megure.

402
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:08,154
Sergeant Matsumoto.

403
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:13,654
What?

404
00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:44,354
What?

405
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:47,554
Officer Chosuke's going to Tottori?

406
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,054
Not me?

407
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:50,554
You idiot!

408
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:53,354
We can't dispatch a greenhorn like you to another prefecture!

409
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:56,754
He's going as a representative of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police after all.

410
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:59,854
But Inspector, didn't you called me at home this morning?

411
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:03,354
Sorry! His name is Chosuke Takagi!

412
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:06,154
Since you both have the same last name, I made a mistake.

413
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,754
Officer Chosuke's last name is Takagi?

414
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:12,354
Gosh... That Yumi!

415
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:20,754
Oh, no? I wonder if somebody's talking about me?

416
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:22,954
Take care of the children, okay?

417
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:25,154
Be careful taking them home!

418
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,654
Yes, sir.

419
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:29,454
And?

420
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:30,654
Do what with you?

421
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:33,854
Oh, well, you see.

422
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,954
Please be...

423
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,254
Right!

424
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:46,754
Before heading home, let's go to Karaoke.

425
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,154
Oh, sounds good!

426
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:49,154
Karaoke?

427
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,354
Aye!

428
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:51,454
Let's! Let's!

429
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:54,554
-"Masked Yaiba" -"Masked Yaiba"

430
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:55,954
Would you like something to drink?

431
00:23:57,254 --> 00:23:58,354
What a day.

432
00:24:31,781 --> 00:24:33,581
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,181
"Chandelier"

434
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,181
The next episode has to do with height.

435
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:39,981
In our case, it's more a problem of discrepancy of weight than height.
